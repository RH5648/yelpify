This place was awesome! The Spartacus with egg whites is definitely the way to go. Large pieces of asparagus, thick cut mushrooms, and fluffy egg whites. I dig this dish. The had splenda for the coffee on the table so I didn't have to ask anyone to travel to the back of the kitchen for any. I was pleasantly surprised by the great service.

We were only one of a small handful of tables but our server was great. I am surprised myself to say 'but' but there are so many times where you hit up a place that is a touristy spot on off hours only to be treated like you are invading their space. Not so for us. Our server was friendly, attentive, and very kind considering we also had the 2.5 year old in tow who just wanted to shake his booty on the dance floor. The music was fun, the food was tasty, and again, the staff was very friendly.  I look forward to making Whiskey Rose a part of my repertoire when visiting Westgate!",2014-02-09 23:15:09

NQsIgtbD6QvNuCaLzkRb6g,3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,5XZgjdttahrvS5JoXVZ4Kg,2,5,0,0,"Man... I really wanted to like this place, but the Maitre D' really flushed the entire mediocre experience down the toilet last night....

The set up of the restaurant is not optimal as it is all high tables and high chairs. We were two couples seated at the corner of the table and so it was a little difficult to carry on a conversation at such a weird angle. But, no stars removed for poor design....

This is a meze (ie. tapas) bar, and so the menu is quite limited. I didn't find it to be super varied to be honest, but we chose 8 distinct tapas to try out and were excited about them. As soon as our waiter (who later bluntly informed me that he was the maitre d') took our order, he fussed about us having placed two separate orders as two couples. He told us that it was in our best interest to order things as a group of 4 rather than in couples to ""enhance the experience"". We then informed him that we had some food intolerances etc, and that we preferred to order separately. He was very displeased but we didn't really care because.. well... why tell us how to place our orders??? This was definitely not our first tapas experience and so we know that our night won't be ""ruined"" if we have two separate bills..

Onto the food and service... Service was pretty slow (over 2 hours!) and they forgot to bring out one of our dishes. Food was mediocre at best. Not one single dish was amazing, and some dishes lacked any real flavor. Portion sizes were as expected. 

Up till this point, I was mentally rating this restaurant as a 3.5/5 (because that's what I do.. haha). But what happened next was really phenomenal.

We were asked if we were done, and after mentioning that they forgot a dish, I asked for it to be removed from the bill because we weren't going to wait another 30 min for another mediocre plate. My husband also distinctly asked for 2 bills. Lo and behold, we get one bill totalling $250. At this point, I'm aggravated because not only was the service so-so the entire night, but now our requests were being flat out ignored.

So, I call him back, and explain quietly that we asked for two bills. I get told that this restaurant doesn't make out separate bills because this is a ""group experience"". I then tell him that every single restaurant in Montreal will split bills, and that we had placed our orders separately in the first place to make things easier. He then told us that they don't split bills because he ""doesn't have time to split a tapas plate into 1/5 of the price for everyone who requests it, BUT that because he's the matire d', he'll make a special exception, AND not to expect it next time because this is a GROUP EXPERIENCE""'.............

Do I really need to explain my frustration??

So I told him that we were not asking for ANY tapas to be split any way, and that we just wanted separate orders on separate bills. At this point, we could have paid it as is but it was really a matter of principle.....

UGH. Seriosuly, hands down, worst service in Montreal. Not worth the trip OR our $150 bill. You can get much better tapas in tons of places in Montreal for that price.

I suppose that means they are doing well.  I go here fairly often and I notice that the staff seems to turn over a lot.  Perhaps this is just typical of a fast food joint. 

The food is delicious every time.  It's really really flavorful so I hope you like spice!  The food is quality and taste is always consistent and the staff is always nice.  

One thing that bothers me is the inconsistency among my orders.  I usually get the kids taco meal. Sometimes they give me 2 tacos and sometimes they give me one.  Sometimes the meat is on the side sometimes not.  I honestly don't know which one is right so I never correct them.  It just seems odd to me that there is so much confusion on how to prepare one of very few menu options.",2014-10-14 04:02:43

The atmosphere and cocktails were good.  Definitely make a reservation if you can because it was rather busy when I first arrived for a late lunch.
I started my meal with the New England Fry, which was good, but the real winner was the  Fried Chicken Sandwich.  The bun was just right and the flavors and textures of everything came together into a beautiful dish.  The chopped salad that accompanied it was woefully under-seasoned and bland.  
The dessert menu was a little disappointing.  I enjoyed the McConnell's ice cream very much, but none of the other offerings were too tempting.  My friend let me try her Triple Layer Cake which looked very homemade (not meant as a big compliment) and was just OK.
The biggest disappointment was the horrible decline in service as my meal progressed.  By the time we finished, the dining room had cleared out and there was quite a bit of staff cleaning up.  I tried several times to make eye contact with anyone, but was pretty much ignored.  I finally resorted to waving down a busser to ask for the check and it STILL took a while to get that settled.",2013-01-06 00:36:48

Yes, the english muffins are good, but the rest of this dish was boring. Also, one of the 'over medium' eggs was fully cooked through. I know they're busy, I don't care...they should know how to cook an egg. Also, the set u is difficult, they have you order up at the counter with no real defined line and then try to find somewhere to sit, and then go back and try to listen for your name while pouring your own (not good) coffee and then busing the dishes.....I just don't love it.

We had reservations but had to wait twenty minutes or more and the bar was full so had to stand around by the back door. We were finally seated but the service was slow (it was busy as usual) and it was a long wait between courses. Our server was excellent so apparently the kitchen was overwhelmed and just couldn't keep up with the demand.. The ice berg wedge salad was very good but by now it's getting late and we were getting a little cranky. Nine thirty or so and we still haven't got our steaks, our reservations were for 7:30. When I finally got my New York strip I found it was not only tough but someone decided to put a garlic spice on top that completely overwhelmed the meat. It managed to leak into my hash browns and ruin the tase of that as well. Yuck!  It was so late my now I gagged down what I could and left the rest. It was too late to send it back and I didn't make a fuss. A forty dollar mistake. My wife got a tenderloin and it too had a spice of cracked pepper and stuff on top but not the garlic. It was excellent. (Two of us got the New York strip and they were both the same as I described)  So, we were not impressed and it will be a long time before we go back. Certainly not on a weekend.

Walked in the waiting room and office was impeccably clean and comfortable. Dr. Lam and his staff were so kind, considerate, and professional.

The inside of this place has a square bar full of stools  on one side, with large beds and couches on the other. I can see beds and drinks leading to netflix and chill without the netflix. I don't trust them.

I know this doesn't sound great so far but here is the good part: They got a real WOW factor I never would have anticipated. They have an abundance of oversized games! They have dart boards half the size of your body, they have beer pong played with a soccer ball and industrial trash cans themed as cups, TETHERBALL, corn hole, chess, jenga, friggin 4 square?!! Get out of town. That is the coolest adult hang out for adult children I've ever seen.

I will say though... while most of the bar staff was friendly through the drinks we purchased, there was one crab I found there. I asked for a water cup to dilute the alcohol we paid pretty good money for, and he seemed genuinely upset at our responsibility as he flagged us off to a water dispenser and went on about his business with no eagerness to please since we weren't specifically buying drinks anymore. Only nice if we are purchasing from/tipping to you? Not how life works.

I usually order the keg classic dinner with an iceberg wedge salad + blue cheese dressing. There's something satisfying eating a 1/4 wedge of iceberg salad stuffed with blue cheese and bacon bits. The steak was also cooked perfectly. It pairs well with their mashed potatoes and grilled veggies.

The food was OK just had a gluten free brownie and hot chocolate so I can't say much about it.

Why not 5 stars??? Because the ambiance was definitely a little off.. there were dirty patches of water all over the floor because people were walking around in their boots! I don't get it? The cats aren't wearing boots so why should we? I mentioned it to the woman at the register and she said she gets that comment a lot! Soo.....????

Appetizers were tacos & dumplings.  Very good, especially the dumplings, would get them again.

Entree was shared bbq sampler.  All was good, but ribs we had were pretty fatty with little meat on them, but the pulled pork & brisket were outstanding.  The bbq sauces were absolutely delicious.

Drinks were moonshine cocktails and the best part of the meal.  Would return for the drinks alone.  Biggest tragedy is they have no patio for spring evenings.

Omakase sushi-Chef's selection of nigiri and hosomaki.  Total of 13 sushi: tuna, salmon, snapper, yellowtail, albacore, octopus, spicy stuns, and toro.  Very fresh and will fill you up. 

Crispy tuna sushi that came in 4 pieces. I love the crunch of the sushi rice served with a generous amount of tuna. 
 
Seafood Yakisoba- Generous amount of shrimp, scallop, calamari, mussels, and even a lobster claw served with stir fried with garlic cloves, chives, and sprouts in a hot clay pot. The seafood was fresh and had a lot of flavor with the noodles.

However because I made a rule saying if the restaurant uses noticeable amount of MSG I will only give the business a maximum of three stars. 

The restaurant is on the east side facing the street with the cluster of restaurants so it's hard to find if you're not familiar with the plaza layout. We almost missed it actually. 

We started with the wasamayo crispy takoyaki. This is clearly one of my top takoyaki I have eaten. The very crispy skin and overall presentation of the dish were a delight. I would say this is much better than the big jumbo sized ones I had in the Philippines. 

I ordered a hot matcha milk tea and my wife got the hot chocolate with marshmallows. The hot chocolate wasn't much to write about. However, the matcha milk tea COMES WITH MARSHMALLOWS. It tasted pretty refreshing with no icky thickening of the saliva feeling. 

The main meal I had was Gyudon. It satisfies the definition that it should be a meal in a bowl. They had a peculiar mix in that they added avocados, Apple slices and pickled ginger. Honestly I would be satisfied with it, but...

It came with miso soup. That is just way too much food at this point. Shortly after I drank the soup I had developed  the MSG numbness. I am particularly blaming that soup in order to give this place another chance so I can give it a five star rating it really deserves.",2016-01-05 00:09:06

Luckily, the staff are really quick, and the wait time mostly depends on how fast people eat.  Prices are extremely reasonable for what you get.  And what you get is a well-crafted, carefully prepared ramen, with a complex broth that you will find nowhere else.

The tonkatsu (pork) soup base is wonderfully complex and rich, and quite frankly some of the best broth I have ever had.  You can tell they took great care in preparing this soup base.  By the way they even pre-warm the soup bowls before putting your ramen bowl together!

Mixed with strips of seaweed and bamboo shoots, and charsiu, this would be great on a cold winter day (or even a hot summer day like I had it).  The noodles were a little different from what I am used to.  They were a little thinner, light, and with a clean finish.

The gyoza was ok.  They definitely use a lot of ginger.  Very light, and not as dense as most others.

I ordered online (just 1 frickin' sandwich, btw) before I even got driving, because I had limited time & I wanted my order to be ready.

Well, no worries there. Hostess had literally not even put it in yet (at least 25min!!!). Ok. Long deep breath, it'll be ready in 15. Nope. It took an HOUR for a sandwich. 

Meanwhile, this bih is taking orders. Is she a hostess or a waitress, cuz I work in f&b and those are distinct jobs. Groups of nicely-dressed people were standing there waiting for tables while she was taking table orders. And she didn't even put them in, I saw that sh*t. She went to go seat people, yanno, like the job description entails. So head's up, the next sandwich turnaround time was likely an hour, too. I'm actually laughing at this point, because this was happening on a Tuesday. Can you imagine a whole table on a Saturday night? I'm a cocktail waitress, so the cringe factor was REAL.

The food is just ok. It comes in a Styrofoam box with meat on top of a bed of rice...a lot of rice. You can easily finish all the meat and have lots of rice left. They don't make it very saucy and I guess that's to appease the more western customers who like to eat tidy meals.

For the price I paid, I would say I got what I paid for. Hakka food never blows me away. It's always been more of a fusion food than Chinese food to me.

Fortunately we didn't have anything planned afterwards as they still honored the 60 minutes. My massage therapist, Patrice, did a great job hitting my bad areas but not over-doing the pressure so it was still a very relaxing experience. Unfortunately my husband did not have as nice of an experience. The gentleman giving my husband his massage didn't focus on my hubby's lower back as requested. Instead he was preoccupied with my husband's traps which were not tight, tense or in need of the attention they were given--he just has big traps. The gentleman also kept clearing his throat which was very distracting to my hubby when trying to get relaxed and find his ""zen"".  Additionally, my husband mentioned how often he felt the massage therapists nails digging in and scraping him- ouch!

The service has never been bad, but it has been slow. However, Chompies provides all-you-can-eat dill pickles that are everything you would expect from pickles at a jewish deli.  

If the menu is intimidating, stick to the stuff that Chompies is known for - massive sandwiches, sliders on challah bread, and bagels.  In fact, next to the door there is a clearance rack of day old bagels, which last a long time, especially in  the freezer.  There are 12 bagels per bag, for $2.50.  At Costco, a dozen of bagels costs $5 and at the grocery store, a half a dozen bagels cost $5, so this is a great deal if you embrace carbs like us.",2014-05-12 01:36:19

Well, this is my second time in this restaurant, as I was here just about a year ago, when I was literally blown off my seat by this enchanting experience. 

Going through the series of possible outcome, there were 3 possibilities of experience I would encounter: worse, same or better.  I immediately discounted ""better"", since nothing can beat that unique first experience I had.   ""Same"" would not be logical after 1 year, since everything changes with time, especially in restaurant kitchen.  By process of elimination, I concluded this experience would be lower.  Far lower, than my first experience in this restaurant. Again comparatively speaking. 

Let me tell you that I could not have been more wrong.  Perhaps the very few times that I was happy to be wrong. 

My colleague and I experienced a serenade of culinary appetizers, each of which was more exciting than the previous one and all bursting with flavours.  

Our entire dinner was showcasing the culinary landscape of goddess Ambrosia where Food, Science and Art work in perfect harmony.  

The chef must be busy experimenting to invent ostensibly bizarre dishes that were unbelievably out of this world.

So if you love to eat high on the hog, and love to have a toothsome experience, you know where to go. 

If you are invited to Europea Restaurant, do like Sheryl Sandberg when she was offered a job at Google. She said ""If you are offered a seat on a rocket ship , don't ask what seat. Just get on.""

Hmmm, I can be fussy when it comes to washroom.  Don't get me wrong.  The washroom was clean.    Not sure if Goddess Hygieia would approve though.  I would have liked to see the washroom up a notch with some innovation to match the amazingly great customer service.",2016-06-25 18:55:42

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and a side of bacon. The bacon was crispy and delicious. The hyevos were good.  There was a need for a little more spice though. I do like the crispy tortillas that added a great texture.  My counterpart had the Cuban sandwich. This was a bad choice.  Perhaps I've been to Miami too many times, but this was lacking in mustard big time.  The pork was crumbly and kept falling out. Eh.

That said, I'll have to compare this to Steve's gyros as a point of reference for most of you.

On a whim I saw a sign that said Greek Food and a Gyro sounded good. After a minute or so looking through the strip mall, I found The Fat Greek and walked inside. 

It's what you can expect from a Mom and Pop place, clean but very minimal and a little kitch. I grabbed a menu when a very friendly woman with what I'm guessing is a Greek accent asked me if I wanted to eat there or togo. I ordered the Beef/Lamb Fat Greek Gyro togo with fries. This was a slight upgrade from the regular Gyro as it had Feta and a few other things.

The food came out super fast and hot. I hopped back in my car and headed back to the office. When I picked up the gyro I noticed it was HUGE and the fries were delicious. One bite of that big wrap and I couldn't stop. If someone had walked by they would have thought I hadn't eaten for weeks. The meat was juicy and flavorful.

On my first visit, my party of 3 sat at the long, communal table in the middle of the small restaurant. From our central location, we could marvel at the beautifully decorated space and spy on what every other table in the place was ordering. I loved the rustic feel of the dining area -- wooden farm tables, shabby chic shutters on the ceiling, miss-matched chairs. Super warm and welcoming spot. 

We spotted the buffalo cauliflower appetizer at a neighbor's table first and knew it must be ours! I'm so glad we ordered that as it was the highlight of the meal! Piping hot with nice crunch, the hot sauce was balanced perfectly by the buttermilk dill sauce. And, all that was topped with carrot and celery confetti. That's right, folks. Confetti. Of carrots and celery. That takes ""throw some confetti on it"" to a whole new level. I don't think I'll ever be able to look at confetti the same way again. 

For my entree, I had the ""tuna"" melt. It was tasty, but not at all what I was expecting from the description. Because it included wakame, I thought it would have an Asian flavor. It didn't -- not the end of the world, just threw me for a loop. If I was in charge of naming this menu item, I would probably call it The Warm Hummus as chickpea is most certainly the star of this dish. The chao cheese was a new adventure! If I hadn't know it was vegan from the menu, I would have thought it was a slice of provolone. I had the veggies as my side. They were pretty unremarkable. After scoping out other Yelper's photos, I probably should have gone with the fingerling potatoes.

You just don't get Gravlax or Scandinavian Food anywhere except for cruise ships and Ikea but here you can get real fresh gravlax thats moist, rich and not too sweet and made just right, tasty with dill and a yummy mustard sauce with it. My super generous plate came with three sides and made with Hanna's own pickled beets that were sauced with rich sour cream. The cole slaw is very fresh, sliced nice and thin and seasoned with fresh dill. The tomato salad is very flavor packed with lots of fresh basil. The food was all flavorful and seasoned very nicely. I remember really liking the rosti from the old Tempe location but was disappointed with the rosti from this new Mesa location as it might have been purchased from Ikea as it had that McDonald's hash brown taste to it but I do note the Mashed potatoes and the dill potatoes looked Excellent and I was sorry I didn't order one of them instead of the rosti.

My husband tried the stuffed chicken breast. It was boneless and very moist. It was prepared very well. One of his side was the green bean salad and it was just like everybody's Mom's green bean salad made with those canned green beans.

The house made desserts do differ from the old Tempe location as the Beaver Balls and other baked desserts are gone and I remember they were very good.

We tried the Swedish Crepe with lingonberries. It was good I liked the not too sweet taste of the lingonberries and reminds me of my lingonberry shrubs from my old house that I planted. The crepe was good but the ice cream was too dense and too sweet for my taste.

You get a warm fuzzy feeling dining here as Hanna, her son and daughter are so friendly. They make you feel very welcomed.

Today I got the peas pulao,Basmati rice,Malai Kofta (the one I spoke so highly of in my previous review) and Vegetable korma.

Both the gravies were identical in taste (in spite of being different dishes).I was so disappointed that I called the restaurant and asked them if they had changed their chef,they said they have been serving the same recipes for the past 30 years.
The kofta in the gravy tasted funny (no sign of any cottage cheese) and the vegetable korma was super salty.
The guy on the phone did say that they could give me something else instead but It's not worth a drive (they do not have home delivery).He did offer to give me something else when I go in next!

All things apart I think this is the problem with most Indian restaurants, they have no consistency, some days the food is great and others it's just Blah.

I like this place, but I don't love it, and I really wanted to be wow'd by the food here.  They're in Aria, so I expected fabulous flavors and textures, but this place didn't deliver on either except for dessert [I'll get to that in a second].

I made reservations online for 4pm before a happy hour and Viva Elvis event that we had to get to.  We walked in and immediately loved the open feel of the restaurant; however, the decor looked almost tacky with those black, glossy leafless trees around part of the dining area.  Other than that, the layout was pretty nice and we were seated away from the crowd as i requested.

We started off with tapas and stuck with it rather than ordering a sandwich or paella.  From beef and cheese to an avocado cannoli, the tapas aren't even worth getting into very much.  I wanted that incredible flavor profile and excellent textures on the plates; however, the beef tapas, for example, was all soft with no counterpart, and the avocado cannoli was all creamy.  In terms of flavor, everything was seasoned as a restaurant of that caliber should do, but in terms of exciting my palette and making me say ""mmm"", it didn't even come close to a small smolder.

For us, the only great part of the evening involved their Santiago cake dessert served with turron ice cream was outstanding.  Talk about textures and flavors!  The cake was thick, moist, and had just the right sweetness to it.  The ice cream was incredible.  i wanted a huge gallon of that to take home with a side of almond cake [as in one whole cake, please!]  I loved every bite and would've bought another order of it had it not been for my distended tummy.

Overall, a nice experience and one I will go back to, but not for the food.  I'm going back for the dessert.",2010-07-13 04:38:32

She performed all of her duties of taking orders and refilling water, but a little more attention would have made the evening much nicer.  Also, she brought the check out within 5 minutes of bringing us dessert.  I realize they want to do lots of covers during RW, but this was a little off-putting.

The restaurant itself is quite beautiful, with great views of downtown and a sleek open kitchen.  The tables are far enough apart to have a private conversation, unlike a lot of other downtown options.

On to the food.  I had the heirloom tomato salad with basil ice cream, but due to the overabundance of capers, the salad was rather salty.  The chicken entree was fine but unremarkable, but dessert was downright delicious.  Habitat's menu was surprisingly innovative for a hotel restaurant, so I'd certainly come back on another day to sample their regular fare (and hope for another server).

We're Korean, and Korea has many Chinese living there who brought hand pulled noodles to Korea, so Koreans love hand pulled noodles. So, that's my food background that will shed light on my review.

I think it's a hit or miss on the dishes. We tried the chicken and mushroom. The sauce was good. The noodles weren't as chewy as I'm used to. It didn't have that slick but chewy texture. I would say probably the flour is an issue. 

The staple of hand pulled noodles in Korea is Jja-zhang or I think they called it Peking Jja-zhang (I actually don't know how to spell it in English)... in Taiwan, Dan Dan, and in Peking as well they have lots of jja-zhanng... but in Peking, all the places I had it served the black bean sauce in a bowl or a small dollop. The noodles were slick, not from oil, but the noodles had a sheen to them. The same is true in Korea. There is a toothiness to the noodle. At Shang, the sauce unfortunately is super salty, for my taste. I had to send it back and didn't request a replacement. I was told that the style at Shang was salty. If you've had black bean noodles elsewhere, it's really delicious and flavorful. A funky earthy taste with the soy black bean sauce. Anyway, I wouldn't order it if I went back. I think the sauce at China Ma Ma is actually better.

The pork and cabbage dumpling was very delicious. I'd definitely order that. The beef and onion pancake wasn't what I expected, It was more a dumpling than a pancake. I'm used to having pancakes where the dough is cooked as in layers and there's beef within it with onions. These were over a inch thick and about 2 inches round... definitely more like a fried bun. They were okay, but not as good as the pork and cabbage dumpling.

The Shang fried rice was good. Again a little salty for me. I think maybe the restaurant doesn't want to deal with folks asking for soy sauce... but having a lot of the salt really takes away from the flavor. It's Chinese food so there's a lot of oil, but to also have it really salty meant I probably won't go back.

I'm glad there are so many great reviews. Maybe I haven't tried enough dishes. I think it's inexpensive... Five dishes for about $40 so that's pretty cheap. 

It would be great if they tweaked some of their menu items. But hey, it's great to see that we have Artisan Noodles in Las Vegas.

Their cocktails! I came in here with no expectations. Thought it's the typical cocktails but to my surprise, the moment I took the first sip, my eyes widened. Their cocktails are easy to drink and yummy. Especially if you're into less of the alcohol taste or have a sweet tooth when it comes to cocktails, this might be a place you want to try out. 

I really liked the Bonita Applebum. If you are a fan of cucumber and elderflower...then you'll love this drink. The refreshing taste of cucumber in water is great, now in an alcohol drink? What more can you ask for?? I think it's the combination of lemon, honey, cucumber and rose which did the trick!  The other one I tried was dirty money (talk about the cool names right??) and I thought it was good too! Loved the touch of pineapple in this. But personally I'm not too big of a fan of tequila so I wasn't jumping with joy over this drink. However I liked how they were creative and used lemongrass in the drink. I think the next time I go, I'll try crystal clear Coco Chanel or straight flossin est good fortune, Toronto!

Also remember to bring cash or check since it's all they accept (no plastic, but they have an ATM in lobby). 

The entertainment is wonderful! The organist only talks a little bit between songs and the two times I've been there recently he played for a good 45 minutes to an hour before he took a break. He also sings happy birthday every set. 

If you want to enjoy a different and unique place for dinner that includes entertainment definitely stop by!",2015-01-08 06:00:55

It was quite busy so I had lots of time to make my choice, and it was a good one.
I ordered the small curry bowl - I chose the spinach basmati rice and the chicken curry. It was less than $6, and was plenty of food. I like it because it was tasty, filling, but still light and not over filling.

Unfortunately, only one appetizer and one entree wasn't going to be problematic for my allergies. And, unfortunately these were items that I was not particularly interested in. But I was there already so I went with them  (props to the staff and chef for responsibly handling the matter).

The app was a Caesar salad. I don't like Caesar salads. If you do, you might enjoy it, but it is something I just can't get into. 2/5.

The entree was salmon with some seeds and grains. The presentation was nice, but the dish overall was a little underwhelming. Not bad, just not substantially impressive. I'd say 3.5/5, good enough to get again but not to seek out.

Sadly the two listed desserts didn't work with my allergy. So, the substitute was some strawberries with whipped cream. I appreciate the substitution, and it was enjoyable, but I can't say it was anything special. 3.5/5

8gbI86AiECwFtViM_4iKmA,F-1ClQ8bSEp2T7NSnVYNRA,rIcEm0o8Xk413HWD4-f2QA,2,1,0,1,"So I hit this place today for lunch with some friends, first time dining there. 

My impressions are that the atmosphere is great, very modern and upbeat, different from what you'd expect from the typical Italian joint. We ended up dining on the patio, which was a nice experience. The ambiance out there is perfect, you have shade, some trees, nice stone-topped tables and it isn't cramped by the other tables. 

We skipped appetizers and decided to go for some of the signature dishes. I went for the lasagna, since I'd seen it raved about in other reviews here. I have to say that I was somewhat underwhelmed by the portion that I got. It was basically about the four inches by 5 inches and about two and a half inches tall. The very first thought through my mind was, ""That's all?"" To make it worse, they serve it on a plate that is gargantuan, which only serves to make the poor thing look even smaller than it already does by itself. Considering this dish is priced at almost $15, I was really expecting more (a lot more). In terms of the flavor, it was excellent, so no complaints there, but the presentation was definitely not polished or perfected. It really did look on par with something someone made at home, not in a professional setting. Again, for nearly $15, this fell short of my expectations. 

The service seemed excellent throughout our meal, with constant and super friendly drink refills and courtesy from all parties we interacted with (including the owner). 

Would I go back? Probably if I was someone's guest and they wanted to go there, yes. On my own, probably not likely to return or take anyone else over there. I just can't get past the absolutely ridiculous pricing they have for portions which leave you hungry. I topped out at nearly $25 with tip and all I had was the lasagna and a drink, no salad, no bread, no sides, nothing. I'm sorry, but one should be ashamed to charge that much for so little food unless it is otherworldly good, which this definitely was not. I would give one star for the food but considering we had fantastic service, I offer a second star. 

My advice to anyone at Cafepino that is reading this, lower your prices or start giving people more food for the money. Quality is fine, but portions are ridiculous for what you charge. This place could be great if it wasn't pricing itself out of existence.",2011-11-02 04:56:40

We ordered brisket, ribs, seasoned green beans, BBQ beans, mac n cheese, coleslaw and peach cobbler. If you buy a drink, it's served in a can.

The brisket was tender and juicy, but did not have a smoke ring, and was served sopping in its jus. It was cut with the grain instead of against the grain. The ribs were great, cooked just about perfectly. I wasn't a fan of their mild sauce, but that's just personal preference, when I got some sweet sauce on the leftovers, it was better than the first round. We also had a sample of hot links - excellent!

The sides were great! Seasoned green beans, cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, the best I've had! The BBQ beans were sweet and some of the best I've had. The mac n cheese had an edge on it and was hands down the best I've had! My husband said the coleslaw was good, but not the best.

We shared peach cobbler, and I found it a little heavy on the spices and the crust had almost completely degraded. Stodgy.

The cans of beverages - come on! Everyone knows BBQ needs big sips! BYOB! I found myself stealing sips from my son after mine was out.

It was perfect weather to dine al fresco, lots of bees though.

I'd love to jump out of the gate raving about the poutine, but like anything you gotta save the best for last - so I'll start at the beginning. We were heading to the Fairy Tales Festival and wanted to try something close by. Sure enough the good ol' Yelp map popped up the Brasserie Kensington to which I started reading. Good reviews, good poutine, Wendy's a fan...ok - I'll try it. We show up and they're full.  However, an awesome looking chick with BRIGHT RED HAIR and shocking lipstick gave us a table for an overdue reso which was perfect. The place isn't huge, it's quite quaint really with nice big front windows and an eating bar as well. I quickly looked around to notice that everyone was attractive (distracting much!!) and the clientele was a huge mixture in ages but everyone looked like they had money and nice clothes. The adorable waitress came by to offer water and take drink orders and of course explain a couple specials. The wine menu was pretty decent and the prices were definitely in a good range. A delicious Malbec was ordered.

I perused the menu - and I was lost. How could I choose? So many unique and weird burgers, so many deliciously described sandwiches and of course a large insert of 6-8 ridic looking poutines. I already knew at this point I would have to come back soon. ""House made onion rings"" sat on the table next to me - and it literally took the inner strength of Superman to not take one (especially considering it was two women and they were ""full"". Pffttt..FIT THEM IN). Waitress returns and we place our orders. I have the hanger steak with peppercorn sauce and poutine on the side - OF COURSE. My cohort in crime ordered the Croque-Madame (which sounds very reminiscent of a drag name) with an extra egg on top. Shortly after ordering another table is delivered a full poutine which is MASSIVE and drenched in delicious gravy. Seriously, if I make it to my meal without eating someone else's I'll be a superstar. (Note: I was particularly hungry before arriving).

The meal arrives and it's a far cry from good. It's pretty fantastic. My steak was really, really good and the sauce was delicious. The side of green beans were brilliant green and crunchy. But what ev's..the POUTINE IS WHERE IT WAS AT. It was the basic version, nothing fancy (start small right). The duck fat fries were the best I might have ever had. Perfect cut size and perfect brown. THE cheese was soo good and melty and the gravy was the best in my life. I don't know how they made it or why it's different, but it was. I couldn't even focus on where I was. I had been transported to the poutine heaven of my dreams. A meal well played Brasserie K. The Croque-Madame across me was actually quite pretty and attractive looking and it went down very good as well. The bread was fresh and toasty and the mound of thin sliced ham with grainy mustard and fried eggs. It was a sandwich very well served. 

Service throughout was also at a high standard with water filled every 3 minutes and follow-ups done on everything. Quick watch check and its 15 minutes to the movie - WE CAN SQUEEZE  IN DESSERT. I order a lemon curd tart that was in a buttery delicious shell with a really tart and delicious curd (that I was told later contained tequila). Who knew. Across the table was a peanut butter ice cream served on a chocolate terrine - picture dense, mixture of chocolates and very rich. In a great way.  The bill was paid (note here that the price points are actually that of a food chain like Moxies or Joeys and not overly inflated for any reason, which was nice to see) and we had to jet - movie starts in three minutes.

We had a great experience and were brought to a poutine land I need to revisit. Similar to Mario World 4 - I wanted a super inflated huge poutine that my super inflated belly could enjoy.  I shall see you again Brasserie K. Well done this time.

Contrary to many of the yelpers, I can't give this place anything more than ONE star.  

If you like high carb, high fat, high sodium foods, this is definitely the place to come to. Otherwise, you are better off eating a hamburger -- less damaging to your body. 

My wife and I came and we ordered Shoyu Ramen, Tonkotsu Ramen and a regular fried rice. 

Both Ramen have three pieces of CharSiu -- but they are not Charsiu, they are thin slices of pork belly. If you like pig fat, you will find this to be hog heaven. 

Both the Miso Ramen soup and the Tonkotsu soup are very, very greasy and quite salty. The ramen noodle is of the thin variety that can be purchased from many of the Asian food markets. Both Ramen bowls are filled with scallion, bamboo shoots and seaweed. 

In many other Ramen noodle houses, there is always a half marinated hard boiled egg that comes with the ramen dish, but not this one.

Pricing on the Ramen is quite reasonable -- about $7.00 each. However, I can't tell whether it is good tasting or not, when food is covered with grease and salt, my taste buds are over powered. 

We also shared a regular fried rice. Again, it is quite greasy and the rice is bit too soft. Many other Asian restaurant can do a better job.

The service was definitely lacking. Very bad customer service. The lady was not friendly or helpful at all. We felt we were a bother to even be there.

Prior to coming here I was dreading coming into the dealership because most other ones I've been to have left me leaving empty handed and unhappy due to their rudeness or pushy sales tactics. Everyone over at Towbin Dodge was very nice before, during, and after the transaction and never did I feel uncomfortable or unsure about my purchase.

I had heard about Towbin Dodge from searching online through all the Dodge dealerships in town and they seemed to have the most inventory, color selection and best online pricing in town...I guess that's what makes them the KING OF CARS! There was a little mishap when we first walked in though because the salesperson I had been in contact with via e-mail had to go home sick but we were quickly introduced to Ryan, who is new to Vegas and Towbin but is very knowledgeable about cars...probably because he's owned or driven seemingly everything on the market; just ask him to tell you about them! I was very impressed and we spent quite a while talking about various fast cars and not just Dodge vehicles.

Come to Ryan and he'll take care of you and go above and beyond to make sure that you're satisfied with your new car. After we spent 4 hrs going through test drives and paperwork, it was closing time so they were unable to detail my new car on the spot. Ryan called me the next morning and scheduled an appointment for Monday morning. When I dropped my car off I was given a loaner car for the day which was awesome because I didn't have to worry about getting to work or back to the dealership. I picked up my car today and it looks even prettier than when I bought it! That Redline Pearl really shines :)",2014-07-29 23:25:00

The food actually isn't too shabby, either as the menu is very accommodating for varying palettes and even the gluten free. Plus, they have a more than adequate beer selection along with some good, mixed spirits as well.

Most people come here for the brick/honey toast and crepe cakes, and for the brick/honey toast, you can choose different toppings. You can read all about the crepe cakes and brick/honey toast in pretty much every other review of Is Sweet. Nothing super new or novel on that aspect.

I come here to study since they're open pretty late, the wi-fi is good, and the environment is pretty quiet/peaceful. They have their busy moments when people come in to sit and chit chat with friends over some desserts, but for the most part, it's quiet and intimate. During the day, there's a lot of natural light which is nice for studying/working or the occasional instagram shot.

I usually get hot tea here since it's reasonably priced ($5 for the whole pot). They will also refill your pot with more hot water when you run out which is nice when I'm studying here for a while.

The customer service is good. They're always really nice and inviting when I come here which is a plus.

This is Southern food, served similarly like a cafeteria.  They have daily specials and items served all week; but I recommend sticking with the daily specials.

For breakfast, they have the usual eggs, bacon, biscuits and such.  The one negative I had was the toast with the liquid butter they used on it... the toast is better without butter.

For lunch, as mention... go with the daily specials.  If Fried Chicken is the special that day, get it.  The sides are the traditional southern sides you would expect, and they do rotate them; so if you wanted fried okra (like I did one day), you might have to come back another day for it.  

Food quality wise is pretty good.  Some of the items can be rich (in butter, fat, or other flavor device) and it can settle heavy in the stomach if too much.  I don't recommend eating here daily if you value controlling your waist line; but once a week or two should be okay.  The restaurant is clean with plenty of seating available (inside or out).

Delicious delicious pizza!   Although the owners and any true Detroit pizza loyalist would cringe when I say this, think of it in the same family as Chicago deep-dish, only square and with a lot more crunch from baked cheese.  

We had a few different types in order of awesomeness: Good old days, Double Pepp and Truff-ghi.  I'd order any of them again however Good Old Days definitely stood out as the winner.  

We had a party of 5 guys who came with a good appetite.  We ordered 3 larges and each took a slice home.  

Highly recommended pizza.  We will definitely be going back!

They were super helpful in explaining how everything was served and I couldn't decide what to try so they offered to make me a half Aiko and half Moki. They're served in flat bread to hold all the delicious toppings. The Aiko's main ingredient is mango chutney and jalapenos (almost reminded me of a sweet salsa). The Moki had green chilis, bean, and cheese. They were both so tasty, I couldn't decide which to eat first and which to save for my last bite. 

I can't wait to go back and try some other great combos  (you can create your own from a long list of inventive toppings).",2011-01-16 00:02:49

Ladies and gentlemen, your newest member of Phoenix's local restaurant community: The Main Ingredient Ale House & Cafe. 

When I heard TMI was opening last night, I knew I had to go immediately as my work is very soon going to keep me away from Phoenix a lot over the next few months. I wanted to at least check it out now so I'll remember to go again during those brief periods that I'm back. 

I was greeted warmly as soon as I walked in by Courtney, who along with her husband Matt are the co-owners. I took a look around the main part of the restaurant - not too many major changes of the interior from its Lisa G days, but still a great vibe. And a De La Soul poster! Word. 

I then headed towards the bar, sat down and introduced myself to Matt, who I could tell was stoked about his first full day open. The bar itself was full of regular folks from the neighborhood and other local business owners who were there to chip in their support. A nice selection of microbrews on tap in front of me, and on the back shelf an array of wine and a vintage Schiltz statue holding up a lighted globe. 

I took a look at the menu and noticed both carnivorous and vegiforous options, with everything around $10 or under. Desserts included 3 flavors from Crave ice cream (their neighbor) and offerings from the Arizona Cheesecake Company (Mark and Courtney told me that they wanted to keep everything as local as possible). 

I saw Ayesha S.'s chile mac n' cheese, which looked great and she gave it her thumbs up of approval. Alas, with my doc-prescribed food restrictions, I had to limit myself to just a couple of things. I started off with a bowl of olives ($3) and then had the Winner salad ($9) which included mixed greens, turkey, egg, strips of salami, and some others items which at the moment I've forgotten. The olives were strong - a lot of  garlic and spice - which I was fine with but wasn't sure how others would take it. The salad was great, although I had to pick out the salami (thanks, doc). Someday I'll be able to eat the whole thing, along with the rest of the menu (hopefully).

To drink I had two glasses of wine - a cab and a zin. I'm only supposed limit myself to one glass, but as TMI was brand new and I'd eaten rabbit food all day and was having a good time, why the hell not. Both glasses were great, and I also got a small taste of a brand new concoction by Matt -  a rich, chocolatey porter ale with raspberry-infused vodka. Tasted like liquid dessert. Too bad I can't really order it moving forward but Matt's got a winner on his hands.

In terms of music, old school hip-hop beats and other phat tunes. Matt and I are the same age so I was appreciating each track that came on (Tribe, Digable, etc. Hell, even PM Dawn! Whatever happened to those guys?).  Volume was just right. 

As the evening wound to a close, I was able to talk to the owners further - about their plans for the place, their back story, on opening a new business - and really felt great that this house just off 7th Street is  in the hands of a young, energetic couple ready to make their own imprint on the Coronado neighborhood as well as Phoenix in general. 

Best to their success.

4 stars for now (come on, it's Day 1).

I had such a wonderful dining experience and when I heard they were opening a Las Vegas location, I freaked out from excitement!

The overall experience was the same-- a U-shaped bar if you're trying shabu shabu or sukiyaki and some non-bar tables for other food items. The menu looked slightly different. There were some new items (Wagyu, Pork Belly, Swisher sauce, etc) that I didn't see at the Artesia location and also, the prices were higher. Then again, Vegas is always expensive so I wasn't entirely shocked.

I always opt for Samurai Yojie's Cut Shabu Shabu. 7 oz. of delicious meat, although I think I could still kill the Sumo (10 oz.) if I'm a hungry hippo. It comes with the sliced meat, brown or white rice, assorted fresh vegetables, broth, tofu, noodles & 2 sauces (Goma is life!). Swish swish and cook that meat, dip them in your sauces & devour them along with your veggies as you wish. Service is excellent so make sure to ask to customize your overall meal with various seasonings if you love it spicy.

Even with all the food, my friend & I had room for dessert & we ordered the Green Tea White Chocolate with Strawberries and Banana. I almost licked the bowl clean; it was that good. My palate was as happy as my belly. It was a good ending to a yummy meal.

Yojie is a little pricey but the excellent customer service, friendly ambiance, delicious food are worth it. This place is all in all just good vibes! And you never know, you might be able to meet the co-owner, the ever hilarious comedian Jo Koy while dining there. ;)",2015-06-10 20:06:18

THE GOOD:
Place looks the part (aside of the hospitality of the hostesses upon arrival). We had the black bean quinoa burgers and they were amazing. Hands down perhaps the best vegetarian burgers we have ever had. They were huge and deliciously messy to eat. The fries were a bit over-salted and conflicted with the flavor of the burger. Next time I may try the cole slaw or salad instead.  Table service was great also. These was never a moment our drinks weren't refreshed. A+ for food and A+ to Patrick for the service. 

THE BAD:
On arrival we were ""greeted"" by a handful of hostess type ""kids."" None of them had name tags or a recognizable brand outfit so you assumed they were the hostesses. I say ""greeted"" when we walked in, aside of a blank stare and a ""how many"" look, we were not acknowledged. A male host took us to a table. One side of the table was facing the glaring sun and when I asked if we could have a different table, he actually said ""whatever."" It was obvious that the hosts need to be trained in hospitality.

We recently stayed at Palazzo last month which we loved, but after staying at Aria's tower suite for EDC weekend, Aria is our new favorite hands down. It's a huge suite and we got the 2nd highest floor on the building (53rd floor) w/ a gorgeous view of the pools, cosmo, and vdara.

Check in was a breeze and the staff were very welcoming. The tower suite was so awesome, lights turned on automatically when walking into the room. I like that they also have 2 fridges in the room. 1 is free to use to store your food/drinks like at Rio, the other is pre-filled w/ beverages etc and it will charge you if you take it. There are 2 bathrooms in here, 1 in the living room and the other in the master bedroom. The bedroom is frickin awesome! The king bed was really big, plush, and comfy, but they need new colored sheets cause the brown isn't very romantic LOL. There were lots of pillows and they were goose feathered which I love because it's so soft. Anyway, the bathroom in the bedroom is so cool w/ dual sinks, a nice jet bathtub, huge showers w/ a giant seat inside, AND the best toilet ever. Yes, the TOILET PEOPLE. It's like one of those toilets in Japan that washes your butt for you!!! It was our first time using it and I really wanna get one in the house now hahah. It even has a seat warmer on the toilet and you can adjust the temperature. 
-There's tv's in the living room, bedroom, and bathroom. It was nice to be in the jet bath tub w/ bath salts watching tv
-They provide toothbrush & shaving kits here!
-The lotion, shampoo, body washes were good quality. Didn't leave my skin feeling dry. Loved the green tea citrus shampoo!!

The room is very high-tech, loved that the little ""ipad"" by the bed controls the ENTIRE suite, not just the bedroom. It controls the temperature, tv's, lighting in the restrooms both in the bedroom and living room, etc. The a/c filtration system in here works beautifully, never felt dry or anything like at the cheaper hotels. I loved the bathrobes and slippers provided as well. We used the fitness facility and pools which were really clean. The fitness facility had everything your local 24/LA fitness would have EXCEPT stair masters :( They provide you w/ towels and water bottles as well as apples at the gym here. Next to the gym is a nice fireplace area that you can chill at, it's really tranquil. The pools are are great, we got to soak up sun w/out being bothered w/ lil kids running around. The jacuzzi was bigger than the typical normal circular ones. It was more like a big oval, which was nice 'cause I like my space and it didn't get as hot. There are multiple pools here and the crowd is more mature.

I love that everytime we call for room service/front desk they greet us by our last name. Speaking of which, the room service here is fast. Another nice gesture is we told the front desk it was our anniversary and they surprised us by having room service give us complimentary ammenities! I seriously felt so pampered here, the room was clean and free of any bugs. I highly recommend Aria because of the great location, professional service, and 5 star rooms.

We ordered the Fairfax with bacon and the sandwich was good, even if it didn't quite live up to our expectations. The eggs are cooked really well and the bun is pillowy soft. Adding bacon was a good idea as it added a bit of needed saltiness with the creaminess of the eggs. I couldn't really taste the cheese, and we forgot all about the sriracha mayo and caramelized onions until the last few bites, where it all seemed to have gotten concentrated.

The first 3 times I've order this, I was drooling, it's just so good. I even shared with a friend and he really liked the way it tasted too. Ordered it a few more times after that and it just doesn't taste the same as before.. not sure why. Maybe they changed the chefs or something but I stopped getting the pulled pork here. Next to the pulled pork poutine, I get the chicken quesadilla. It's NOT bad. It's pretty average. The sour cream this time around is more fluffy in texture and it's usually the liquidly type one so it was a little hard to dip the piece in to get some sour cream.

Aside from food, I would grab a drink. Favs would be any of the sangrias. I tried the traditional with white one and it was yummy.

We did the lunch menu for $30.12

 Lobster Gazpacho; Traditional Chilled Spanish Soup with Lobster Meat- There was a sphere in my spoon and it was a cream ""truffle"" with some broth in it. The texture of it bursting with broth was texturally exciting. The soup itself was very refreshing and bright, good and very fresh chunks of lobster.

Salmon with Truffle; Truffle Béchamel, Portobello Mushroom - the salmon was perfectly cooked, the bechamel was aces. Salmon is a very common fish so normally I'm a bit ""meh"" about most preparations but this was pleasant. 

Santiago's Cake; Almond Cake, Turrón Ice Cream, Candied almonds - I am a almond freak and this was a decent cake. I wish there was more of the burnt leche tasting turron ice cream. The crumb candied almonds mixed in with it was good. 

I of course try everything Angie is eating and all pretty good. Stuffed Piquillo had a surprising hearty flavor from the mushrooms, steak with eggplant and mushroom demi glace was tender, churros was ok, but its rich bitter dark chocolate dip was great.

We headed over there today after a long bike ride, arriving around noon, which, for a Saturday, meant waiting for about 20 minutes.  The five of us ended up seated at the counter, but that was our choice since we were starving and couldn't wait any longer for a table.  I had the California Omelet (spinach, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, and olives) with hash browns and sourdough toast.  I've never had it myself,  but I hear the Pork Chili Verde Omelet is to die for and The Coffee Cup is famous for it.  I was happy with my breakfast and even had some of my coach's pancakes to boot.

We were almost going to ask for ketchup. Then we had the hummus which I found to be mediocre. The chicken was dry and lacked flavour. Then we received the beef wrap.

I always got the kofte (wrap or kebab) and it was always perfectly prepared: juicy and well-seasoned. I knew I would keep coming back. However, in more recent visits, they've either run out of the kofte if it was toward evening/night time, or they simply did not have it available (even during lunch hours). This is pretty disappointing because their kofte is amazing and it is my go-to choice. Because of this, I'm going to have to deduct a point from service. When they don't have kofte available, I settle for the adana, which is drier than the kofte and not nearly as good. I wish they would consistently have the kofte, not just 50% of the time. I used to love this place, but now I just go in hoping they have what I want to order. Also, do not get the eggplant spread and if you are planning on getting the hummus, don't expect too much of it. On a brighter note, the Turkish coffee is very good. Definitely give it a try!

I do remember the service not being incredible, but as long as you're with your peeps and do pitchers, you'll be happy. The wood booths and tables give the bar a homey, smokey feel.

The shop is quite small, with lots of people huddled right outside eating their ice cream. I was a bit confused with the ordering system. I did like the fact that everything is customizable. The first thing is to decide what vessel you would like your ice cream in, and of course for the insta you gotta do taiyaki! At $7 a cone though I don't know if it was worth it. 
We went for the pandan ube swirl, Nutella filling, some oreo Pocky and Graham cracker bears to top it off. I thought I only had the choice of one topping, but she kept asking what else I wanted on it... So confusion ensued from that. 
The flavours of ice cream were great, but the ice cream melted WAY too fast. I thought that it would be much creamier and thicker than what we got. Other than the fact that we made our hands a huge mess (you have to ask for a key to use the washrooms in the mall) we loved the taiyaki, the texture was still pretty crispy and the Nutella was thick and goopy.

However, I CANNOT recommend it for Holiday prepared foods. I ordered, in advance of Thanksgiving, a 5lb cooked turkey breast and whipped sweet potatoes. Each item was listed as sufficient for 4 people. Since we only had 3 people altogether, I thought this would be okay. 

When I went to pick it up at the this store, a store clerk checked me off the list, went in the back and brought back a 1-2 lb turkey breast and two handfuls of sweet potatoes. When I complained, the clerk stated, they ran out of breasts, had to pull one off the floor and cook it; he claimed that was all they had. I stated that would not work. He said the the small sweet potatoes was four portions- NOT. He went back to see if they had a larger breast.

I was expecting a breast that was fresh, that had been cooked in store, sort of like they would do for for cooked meats in the deli. When he came back he had about a 4 lb Jenny O precooked, pre packed turkey breast that you would buy in you regular meat section, nothing that would need to be preordered. For that they were charging 9.99/lb so the breast cost $40. The sweet potatoes were $5.00. I just could not justify paying the price just for a processed product not even cooked in store, so I told them to keep it. Likewise, the sweet potatoes were not satisfactory. I went to the bakery to look at the pies- they had no pumpkin pies, the sweet potato pies were overcooked, and none of the other desserts were appealing to me.

I went to Harris Teeter, bought a 6lb all natural turkey breast, uncooked for $19.( I know I was paying for the  convenience of the breast being cooked but since FM was not cooking it, I don't feel that justified the additional $20 it would have cost to purchase the Jenny O ) In addition to the breast, I picked up asparagus, rolls, two pies and mashed potatoes  all for $36; less than the price of the  one 4lb Jenny O turkey breast.

In addition, to the great atmosphere, Saddle Mountain offers really good food and the service is good. Would I consider Saddle Mountain to be a four-star restaurant? No. However, they do serve a pretty good corned beef and pastrami.  Just the proper ratio of meat to kraut and cheese; served on a good sized marbled rye bread.

The beer selection is great.  I would recommend getting a flight of beer so you can sample.  The prices are reasonable, and the staff is friendly. Not a bad way to spend time with friends and family.",2018-03-07 16:06:10

M'lady and I passed via the stand at the outside of this restaurant, where they were advertising that their sushi was from my recollection 30% off as per of their end of day sale. They were also filling containers with their different dishes, and pricing them very attractively. We ended up getting 1 sushi container, and 1 of the animal meat & condiments container.

I quite enjoyed the sushi, as well as the other container we shared, where even though it was end of the day, the food was very fresh and delicious.

We had gone on a Saturday afternoon which wasn't too busy and they had conveniently seat us under two large umbrellas. They have a lovely patio area & with the perfect weather, we all really enjoyed the ambiance.

There were a variety of dishes ordered at our table .. The salmon with lettuce, the smoked pulled chicken sandwich, the frittata of the day, & the vegetarian sandwich. Everyone really enjoyed their food - the portions were big & the everyone agreed everything was really tasty. I was one who ordered the smoked pulled chicken sandwich. It was much different than any other BBQ chicken sandwich I've had -- it tasted good with the slaw, and the fried pickles added a unique flavor and crunch. I thought the highlight of the dish was the potato salad, however. The bacon added a special something but wasn't overpowering. I'd definitely recommend trying it out!

I will say that House of Tricks is a bit expensive for lunch time but it's a nice treat. I've heard great things about their dinner so I'm planning on returning for a date night!",2015-05-29 00:21:45

Read a BlogTO post that had Banjara in there, and thought ya know why not? It's right down the road from Eva's Chimneys which is a huge plus, so I decided to go here.

From the second I pulled in, and yes I pulled into this place because there is actual parking which is so f'n rare to have! Only about 4-6 spaces, but I went at 12pm and was lucky enough to snag a spot. Already was liking this place before opening their doors.

From the moment coming in the staff was super nice -  once sat down they served poppadom complementary. I love this, and miss it. IDK what it is, but I don't find enough places in the GTA serve poppadom to you before the meal. I'm from the NYC area originally, and I just recall almost every Indian place serving poppadom and with chutney too, before every meal. Indian places in the GTA should do this more please ;)

So everything was off to a good start, food came out quick and it was very tasty. Had 2 different panner dishes to try and another diner had a chicken sagg which they loved, some vegie pakoras too. Staff again was super nice, attentive, always came by to fill up water. 

All in all if you are in Toronto and want to have Indian or better yet, go have Indian  THEN walk down the road to get Eva's right after this is the perfect place to go to. Do it, Banjara then Eva's it's a great combo.",2017-07-31 13:31:04

I know Baja Fresh is definitely Tex-Mex but it's not so bad.  Of course it runs the gamut of other similar chains like Chipotle, Zaba's, and Rubio's.  All different, but all somehow the same.

One big plus of Baja Fresh is the tasty salsa bar!  Their salsa bar here is tops, salsa were are freshly made, the bar was clean, and there was quite a selection.  Besides their pico de gallo, their smoky, roasted salsa is pretty on point for me.  It goes with just about everything.  The mango salsa is another one of my favorites - sweet & spicy.

We eat with our eyes, and Baja Fresh definitely provides a lot of color in their food.  Our order looked bright & fresh!  Thankfully our items tasted as such:

-Baja Burrito with steak - melted Jack cheese, fresh guacamole & pico de gallo 
-Baja BBQ Chicken Salad - fresh greens with kale, onion, bell pepper, jicama, tortilla strips, roasted corn, black beans, tomatoes & topped with avocado, then tossed in a BBQ dressing

I had the Baja Burrito with the addition of romaine lettuce, it was big & hearty!  Heavy burrito stuffed with a good amount of steak & guacamole.  The pico was good too, and the burrito was made even more tasty with the addition of extra salsas - I tried a little of each!  Tortilla was warm and freshly made.

Wifey liked the Baja BBQ Chicken Salad, she opted for the dressing on the side.  It was used sparingly and gave the salad a sweet yet tangy kick.  She also liked adding some pico & jalapeno on her salad as well.

The great thing about Baja Fresh too is that with just about any main order, you get a bag of chips too!  Honestly, they make the salsa bar that much more fun.

We haven't visited a Baja Fresh in a while, and I forgot that with their large to-go plastic cups you only pay 99 cents for a soft drink refill on every visit.  I know at home we must have at least half a dozen of them!  I love making me some Coke with fresh lime, refreshing.

Keep an eye out in the mail for coupons at Baja Fresh too, they come quite often.  Our meal was a great deal, I think we used a $5 off $15 coupon.  Lunch came out to only $14 and change after the discount.  Value added!

I like this particular location at Boca Park, it's clean, crowded, and the employees are friendly.

Their hot dog creations are  creative, tasty and just freaking awesome!  Are they the best tasting hog dogs I've ever eaten? Well... no when compared to a few places in Chicago but they are the best hot dogs in Phoenix with out a doubt.

Your first step is to find the Short Leash Dog truck.  You can find them at the downtown public market on Friday's and I believe on Saturday's too or look them up on Facebook to see where they are set up.  

I recommend the Igby with their spicy beer hot dog ~ very flavorsome sausage grilled to perfection with a topping of coleslaw with crumbled blue cheese and some BBQ sauce.  The combination sounded a bit off when I first read it but it was awesome!  I love the flat bread they use to hold their tasty hot dog creations. I also recommend the Aiko with mango chutney, jalapeños, onions, cilantro and some mayo.  It is also scrumptious but with a little kick!  If you don't like their options you can create your own delectable dog anyway you like it served on their yummy flat bread of course.

Dimly lit, with a complete bar inside the restaurant. Pretty unique layout. Waiters bring the food up from a kitchen located downstairs? The bathrooms were also unconventional. Go check it out!

FOOD:
For appetizers, I shared the pig candy and Brussels sprouts with my friends. My main entree, I got the Dirty pasta (with ground duck).

I couldn't help but think of one word when dining here: ""salty"". I'm not sure if Butcher and the Rye tends to be a bit more heavy handed with the salt, or if it was this one occurrence. But the Brussels sprouts and Dirty Pasta definitely were more than a bit salty to me. 

Brussels sprouts were large enough in quantity to share with a large group. My one friend described it best, ""Kind of tastes like the Cool Ranch Doritos"". The taste was so empowering that I honestly could not taste the Brussels sprouts at all, which is unfortunate.

Pig Candy was pretty decent. A small plate for one, it was tasty, but nothing to write home about. I sometimes judge how much I like a plate by evaluating my willingness to part with it and order something else the next time I come back. Let's just say, I'd probably give another appetizer a chance.  

Dirty Pasta was unique; first time I ever had ""ground"" duck. The noodles were thick and chewy with bits of ground duck sprinkled into the pasta. The sauce was good, but again, a bit salty, so I did not enjoy it as much as I could have. Out of what we ordered, my friends liked this dish most. 

SERVICE:
Need to reserve in advance! This place gets booked fast especially for dinners on Friday and Saturdays. Very polite wait staff and professional.

I called at an off hours to ensure that I could explain to the person that I really wanted this particular table blah blah.  To make a long story short, I explained everything and was assured that that table was booked for me at 7:30 that Friday, and received my confirmation code and was so excited for the special birthday meal to come...

A smiling buddha greets you at the front with the usual arsenal of waving Asian cats. They offer dim sum and Thai dishes? 

The service was very friendly but BOY they were s.l.o.w... Miso soup arrived hot coupled by a respectable salad. A nice sized udon arrived shortly after with nice chewy noodles, a sweet broth, and a side plate of crispy (2 shrimp, 4 veg) tempura. Good value for $7.

2 Salmon bento boxes ($10 each) arrived next, each with salad, and steamed rice...ok I don't eat plain rice but still. Each box came with your choice of one 6pc roll. We had the dynamite roll (which was pathetic) but although nearly pureed at least the avocado was ripe and the tiny shrimp tempura in the center was still crunchy. The other roll was their version of the spicy salmon which was ok because of an unexpected touch of garlic but overall not great...perhaps they had an amateur sushi chef today? The teriyaki salmon was large but I found it bland and a bit dry as it was served nearly teriyaki free, and didn't come with any steamed or stir fried veg :(

As a testament to their service issues, the hwae dop bop arrived last. Sashimi is supposed to be the appetizer. The slices were decent in size and moderately fresh cuts (3 salmon, 2 tuna, 2 butterfish). 

Everything came to ~$38 + tip. I saw an older sushi chef behind the bar so I'm guessing he is the one that made the special rolls that I saw which looked big and badass. The young guy may as well have been blind.

It's one of the few (only?) places you can get cold-filter coffee (with the option of maple syrup as a sweetener) in town, which is nice on these hot summer days.

I work just down the street but rarely go and it always bothers me that i don't. of course when i do go it seems I always order the same thing - which i did again. i always get the Reuben Fat Boy burger. the thing is, i don't even like it that much. it's not bad but there are so many other sandwiches i could get and yet i never do. 

so i got that. Danielle got the fish and chips. she liked the fish and hated the tartar sauce. again, we need to stop trying to be slick with tartar sauce. all you need is mayo (or better yet Miracle Whip and relish - that's all). she said all she could taste was mustard. so, she ate the fish without the tartar sauce. 

we also shared some sour kraut balls as an appetizer after i raved about how great they were. sadly, they weren't as good as they were in the past. mostly pork/meat and hardly any sour kraut. they completely lacked the spicy kick i've enjoyed in the past. 

making matters worse was the fact that the table near us ordered pizza and it looked and smelled amazing. made me wish i'd gotten that instead. next time pizza it is. i almost ordered a small one to go.

This is the quickest and most efficient way to order a cab and I can say this because they came through on the busiest night of the year, New Years Eve! Uber operates through a Smartphone app, so this is how it works: first, you download Uber on your smartphone. Once it's downloaded, you create a username and password and put in your credit card information so that when you order a cab, it's paid for (tip included) without ever taking out your wallet! Recently on New Years Eve, we finally had the chance to order Uber and test it out. It was seriously so simple! We typed in our location and it showed us a map of where their drivers were at that moment. We then confirmed pick-up and it showed us our driver, his profile picture, current location and estimated time of arrival. He showed up within 10 minutes in a clean town car. We got to our location in no time and it was a completely seamless experience. The card was charged at the end of the ride. Uber is a tad (and just a tad) pricier than a cab but for the convenience, the extra couple dollars makes it worth it, especially if it's a time when cabs will be scarce. I've also used Uber in SF when everyone else was frantically searching for a cab. Another cool piece of info I learned is that you don't have to worry about your Uber cab getting stolen. When they arrive to your location, if someone else walks up to the cab, they will first ask ""did you order an Uber?"" and then they will ask you what your name is, not the other way around. Therefore, if you don't say the name on the reservation, you won't get the cab! Welcome to Phoenix, Uber! I'm glad to have you around!",2013-01-03 06:07:50

Located inside the newly built M Resort, Studio B Buffet has a very nice structure for their entrance way.  It seems like that they took the time to figure out the set up and how its going to look, once people stands in line.  Even though, it was kind of busy when we got there, at least they got something for us to read, or to look at.  Mainly something to keep us entertained while waiting in line to get a table.  The line was moving quickly, since they had two cashiers to check you in.  Quickly after, they had some one escort us to our table.

The setting was very nice, it look like a big ""C"".  It is very spacious and roomy.  Enough space to move around, and not hit other tables.  But, the buffet line itself, I didn't like the fact that its all on one line.  I like buffet, where you can move around the island and pick something else, when your waiting for another item to be open.  But the fact of people jumping in front of you and you don't want to jump in front of others, seems a bit awkward in a way.  

The selection of the food, is AMAZING.  They have something that I'm sure everyone would love.  Especially a buffet with Sushi, I would eat that all day if  could.  But, going there at a point where its really busy, the food tend to be slim pickings when your up there.  Since everyone is jumping to get what they want, by the time you get to a certain food, some one already grabbed it before you did.  So the cooks were kind of slow to bring out the food.  On the other hand, it was kind of expected, since it was during busy hours.  

The staff, I believe, was absolutely awesome.  From the point of checking with the cashier, to being escorted to our tables, to the waitress who made sure our glass was never empty.  It was very warming that these staff will still smile and say thank you, despite how busy it was.

It's a great place for all you sugar cravings. I guess now that I am an older adult, I'm not as fascinated. I don't eat sugar candy anymore so this is all a little over rated for me. 
However you can watch the children in this store act absolutely out of their minds with all the candy around. I would have loved this place when I was a kid! They have every candy you have heard of and many that you haven't.  They even sell those Charlie's chips in the van, for this of us old enough to remember them.

A+ for the candy selection. They also have a soda Shoppe, which looked amazing, but I didn't go into it.

Pros-
 * Awesome music (2 separate rooms..1 of the rooms had a live band)
 * Saturday Nights are packed !!
 * Bartenders / Hosts are friendly 
 
Cons-
 * Definitely not a place to catch up with an old friend (really loud)

Tips-
 * Get the AYCD (All You Can Drink) Bracelet... It's totally worth it !  I had Jack and Cokes all night !!  Just don't drink and Drive !
 * Get there early so you can get a seat and even eat.  Food is served until 10pm Nightly

And it's a shame, since it's literally a 1 minute walk away from my work. I would love to love this place, as I'd eat here all the time for lunch! But last night, whoa, what a terrible meal.

I ordered their special, which was a Fried Chicken Sandwich, featuring sliced avocado. The fried chicken was overcooked and a little too blackened. The crust was rather flavorless, and I was picking random dried herbs out of my teeth for like an hour. It was everything a piece of fried chicken should NOT be. The avocado was also not ripe. Barely edible, I opted to disassemble my sandwich and eat the chicken with tons of ketchup. And even then, I gave the rest to my companion to finish off. I chose the potatoes as my side, and they were undercooked.

My friend's meal was a $10 bowl of vegetable soup, which he did not really care for. He's the kind of guy who will finish his plate even if the food sucks, and even he struggled. Also, you shouldn't find bay leaves in your soup. Note to kitchen staff, please remove those going forth!

And yes, the beer is overpriced. I luckily ordered a beer that was on special, but my friend was shocked by how much his beers were! Over $7 for a pint?! Hell no.

The bartender who served us had a fun haircut and was pretty nice. Some of the other servers seemed stuck up. And the actual restaurant space is beautiful!

Next we asked if we could pay credit card?  He looked less impressed.  He mentioned that this was Dim Sum lunch special and we would have to pay cash.

Most place stop at 6, which sucks since most people cant make it anywhere without driving light speed before 6pm after work. So 7pm cut off for HH is a great find! Pass it on!

We ordered the boneless wings to start with half medium sauce and half of their special TD sauce, I recommend both! TD sauce is similar to Zipps Golden sauce if you know what that is like, but better. Then I got the chicken tacos, very good. Enjoyed them greatly! Exactly what I was looking for, hit the spot! Jon got some kinda spicy pasta, which when it hit the table looked amazing, however big prob, they put mushrooms in it, this isn't listed on the menu and Jon is allergic.

Today we ordered the steamed dumplings (a favorite), slices beef stew (see pic) with amazingly tender and quality beef and noodle and egg roles which are delish.

I rated a four because there is always an awkward aroma when you arrive which makes the event somewhat difficult at first.  The other reason is that I find the noodles to be a little bland but that may just be preference not quality.

Sure, there are some growing pains -- the place has been open for a week -- but overall, the experience was above average. 

We arrived around 8pm on a Saturday night and were told to expect a 30-60 minute wait. We ended up finding seats at the bar immediately. Score! Our server/bartender, Alexis was great! Attentive and friendly, checking in with us often and happy to chat about the food and drink options. I did notice they were out of a lot of things... Probably 25% of their food and drink options were crossed off the menu. I really wanted to try the Ramen Mac & Cheese, they were out. Tried to order the ribs. Out. BF wanted to try the Korean Craft IPA. No luck. I wanted the watermelon beer. Gone. 

The wings were out of this world. Things went downhill from there though. The crispy pork belly was cooked well but had no flavor. (We had to ask for some of the wing BBQ sauce to dip it in.) The fire chicken was blah -- had no heat like other reviewers have commented on; think we had a bad batch -- as was the pimento corn cheese on shrimp chips. It was that fire chicken that I think made me sick a few hours later. 

So, all in all, ok experience until the stomach issues. We may go back to give them another chance (my BF liked the spot more than I did) but it's going to take some time and distance. And, I'll probably stay far away from that fire chicken. ;)",2016-02-28 16:33:18

Since there was no lines, I was immediately told any MyVegas rewards are not usable during Christmas since it was blacked out. 

I was disappointed, but I get that.  What I don't get, is the person on the floor and immediately told my wife and kids to leave since they are underage. Sure, I get that minors should not be allowed on the floor and it's not legal. But since I barely paused for a second to ask the hostess and was rudely told by the gentleman to leave before I can barely finish hearing my vouchers were not valid.....that was totally uncalled for.

My girlfriend and I stumbled on to Borealia through yelp and after hearing her read me the menu out loud I quickly followed with 'We're going'. Naturally  when we called they had no reservations and were quite booked, so we got there when they opened to assure ourselves a couple of seats and the bar. The restaurant already had two patrons and filled up fast very close there after. And for good reason. 

Now, I read the only bad review on here and I'll agree the price tag is high but it saddens me that the reviewer didn't know that going in. They just simply sound cheap, to be honest, and their complaint about portion size, means to me, that they had no place in this restaurant to begin with. They're better suited for a place like the Cheesecake Factory...or something obnoxious like that. 

This is fine dining. The portions are elegant and executed perfectly. There's no reason to leave anywhere feeling 'stuffed' but you are certainly satiated at Borealia. Look at the photos for yourself. This place feeds you and it feeds you well. 

I always try hard to criticize every dish I eat in some way, but I can't. They took a lovely concept, added modern complexity and finesse, and succeed. I will say however when I ordered my first cocktail and I didn't find it to my liking the bartender looked a little offended. Because I look so young I gave him a pass. Maybe he though I was just trying to get a freebie. But his next drink was exactly what I wanted and the service from then on was amazing.

Now, the only problem I had was that besides the bowl, nothing else served to me could actually be called sizeable. You know that freak flush of the toilet when only half the water returns and you think to yourself that something weird is going on? That's what I felt like when I was presented my half bowl of noodles.

My friend's beef don was reportedly awesome. It reminded her of this very specific and unbeatably delicious oyako don of her childhood. My other friend's beef udon was apparently also awesome. Both the udon and the toppings in his bowl were more than double that of the ones in mine too. Strange, but I'm not complaining - just telling it like it is.

The two measly slices of sweet tofu skin in my noodles were inari-like and indeed sweet. They could have really used some veggies or other space-filling sidekick. For two extra bucks, I got a tangy and colourful salad and a miniature bag of ""chips"" (crushed instant noodles). I would highly recommend allowing the extra 20 minutes (how long it takes for the custom order to be prepared) for your meal and getting the takoyaki in your combo instead.

I've had very few establishments serve me in such fashion and I would be surprised if an establishment could top the quality of the service in Kai.  

Off the bat, i'm giving this a 4 because I wasn't thrilled with the food that I had.

I would recommend arriving about 45 mins before your ""just before sunset"" reservation so you can sit in the lounge area outside of the entrance to the restaurant and have one of the original, creative cocktails.  Wow, what flavorful and different cockatails!  

Make your reservation for ""just before sunset"" so that you can stare loving at the beauty that the dessert has to offer at the right hour where the earth glows from the beautiful oranges and reds from the setting sun.

I would also recommend, if you are not staying over night, to plan to stay 45 mins after dinner to walk around the hotel terrace area.

I went here for a wedding reception, and we were offered the basic meat menu of chicken, bacon wrapped chicken, sirloin, tri tip, chinese BBQ style pork, pork sausage, ham....and grilled pineapple.  Unfortunately, the pineapple was the highlight of their grilled goods.  The bacon wrapped chicken was moist, but nothing special.  The chicken without the bacon was flavorless, as was the sirloin and tri tip.  The chinese BBQ style pork had a nice sweet flavor with a hint of five spice, but again nothing that special.  Overall, if you are going to pay the regular price for this menu, it's better to take your money over to Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil....they have more meat options with more flavor as well.  The salad bar is also much more limited than the other brazilian churrascarias in town....the bananas are lack luster in that they are really just bananas with a crunchy coat on the outside.  The highlight of the salad bar was the chinese broccoli and the roasted mushrooms.  Everything else seemed like cafeteria food to me.

Let's be straight here; I spend money on food. Paying a good bit for dinner doesn't bother me. 8 dollars for takoyaki though? For 3 takoyaki balls? That's offensive.  7 dollars for some dressed up tofu? Even more skeptical. Takoyaki is street food. Would you pay 8 dollars for a hotdog? I doubt it.

The quality is nice, but being charged tapas prices for cheap food doesn't vibe well with me. This, compacted with the fact that you aren't getting a ""classy"" atmosphere really throws me off.

Is Sweet offers a beautiful display of their cake, topped with chocolate drizzle and an arrangement of strawberries and oranges to the side. As for the taste, This place lives up to its name. Is SWEET. It is SWEET, and I think on the more extreme side of the spectrum. 

What hit me was the texture of the whipped cream. Not fluffy, smooth, but rather patchy. In my opinion, the sauce given to you did nothing to add to the dessert's flavor profiles, but rather gives way to more artificial sugars and sugar overloads.

If you are a lover of beer, this place is great for you. They have an overwhelming selection of beers in bottles/cans organized very nicely, and a large selection of beers on draft as well.

It's a cool menu, they have a great bar, the decor is great. Service was ok. Perhaps trying to do too much?  They're opening 2 other restaurants from what I gather. It's a familiar tale. 

I tried 3 dishes. The first was a special. Squash soup garnished with duck confit and pickled cranberries as I recall. This was the best of the 3. A bit more duck please as there were just a few shards of overcooked bits. It came out just barely warm.  Maybe they spent too much time garnishing it?  Would have been nicer, hotter.  

Next, ""Brussels"". A bowl of Brussel sprouts in brown butter with a lemon aioli and dill topped with grated cheese. Still a bit nauseous thinking about it. Where was the dill?  The aioli was smeared inside the bowl a bit.  There was barely enough to talk about. They didn't skimp on the butter though. Ugh. It was swimming.  

Somewhere around this time my eyes started burning and I thought I would be treated for smoke inhalation from the burning bread in the kitchen.  I imagine the near loaf they serve as under their Cesar salad being torched helplessly under the salamander until no trace of the craftsmanship of the baker remained. Sure enough, my dining companions Cesar bread was burnt. 

Lastly, I had the pig wings. Long beans, mango (too little) other veggies, cilantro, glazed and somewhat candied pork. Interesting dish but lacked balance. It was way too sweet just as my wife's peppers were way too salty. Everything missed.",2014-01-02 00:13:49

The weird thing about Downtown Summerlin is their Starbucks i-s tucked in the corner of Macy's mens. The coffee shop is so small makes you think why didn't Starbucks have their own store - maybe they are testing the waters to see if the place would boom. 

There's lots of parking which is good and the whole mall as I mentioned is outdoors so when it's hot in Vegas it's HOT you will be hot and bothered shopping. When it's cold in Vegas it's bitter cold so you will be running to get in to the store for heat. Not enough shade, places to sit and unfortunately you have to be careful crossing the streets cause the cars can drive up and down the streets and sometimes doesn't stop or drives too fast - unlike Stanford and Irvine Spectrum you don't have to worry about cars driving while shopping. 

The restaurants are new so I'm just going to give it a number 2 for now since I'm not familiar with them and they are not that popular in my book. 

Macy's, Dillards is small compared to the Fashion Mall but it's good enough to go and buy last minute items if you can't wait for an online order or go to the Fashion Mall. There is no Nordstrom. They have a Nordstrom Rack and I have to say I was HUGELY disappointed I felt I walked into a Marshall's or one of those out of date clothing stores. Sorry if I offend anyone - I'm just not a fan or ever shopped in a store like that.

That being said, definitely make sure to try the Baja sauce if you have not already had the opportunity to do so.

Well, this park isn't perfect, but by golly, compared to other dog parks within the city of phoenix, this one's pretty NICE! (Glendale and Chandler are much better - I'm working towards a future list i think) 

I know....the 'hood. I'll admit it's not the best, but on a saturday morning with the park full of soccer game family traffic I doubt too heinous of crimes are going down here. You can park on the street right next to the park fence if you're nervous and want to keep your vehicle within view. I can't comment on others' nighttime experiences, but it does say the park's open until 10pm, so if they're not well-lit, that's a negative. 

There is a huge area for big dogs and a good sized one for yippers, too. The arrangement of seating and shade is quite nice. There are plenty of mature trees providing real shade, and the grass is well taken care of. Too bad that a 'visual minority' of idiot owners litter cigbutts and leave dog crap behind.

We went today, a Sunday, and sat down next to people that had the exact same dog that we have (a female harlequin Great Dane) and knew that it was fate.  We sat by them, because they seemed awesome and in great company, the food flourished in my eyes.  

They have a pretty decent beer selection, they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bell's Two Hearted Ale (but apparently it's an amazing IPA). I knew I'd love mine, he LOVED his.

We had the Mac and Cheese, which was awesome, but not as amazing as others I've had.  So order it if your a Mac person, but don't if you're not.  

We had two sandwiches for dinner, I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak (UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!)  and Seann had the RB&C (an equally impressive Roast Beef concoction). Those were both devoured with great beer and great conversation with others.

Lastly we had the Triple Chocolate Brownie, per a recommendation from our fellow dog owner and it was delish.  VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app, a sandwich and two beers, but it was definitely worth trying.

The menu here is quite extensive and can be difficult for indecisive diners (ie. me). However, there is a board of their top 5 (most popular) ramen to help narrow down the selection. I have my choices down pat: white sesame shio when I'm really craving something soupy and shoyu tsukemen all other times. For those not familiar with tsukemen aka ""dip ramen"", it's a dish of cold ramen noodles with toppings and a bowl of hot, dense soup on the side for dipping your noodles into. It can be the perfect meal for a hot day when you're craving ramen but not ready to chow down over a hot bowl of soup...but really it's a perfect meal for any day of the year :) Be careful though, as the portion is huge! No other joints does tsukemen better than Isshin. 

They're portions are quite generous but if you're feeling extra hungry, Isshin offers karage don or cha sui don on the side and a variety of appetizers like takoyaki (yum!) ",2018-05-29 15:59:04

Mannekin Pis - just as crazy as that new mascot for the old Saharah. Some gold blob. I don't like all these changes. Well, the Fitzgerald went through lots of changes and cleaning up/ renovations in 2012. All the bones are the same: pool, garage, tower... but the decorating and carpet and decor is all new.

It feels new. That contemporary look that people apparently go for... I don't know about you but I actually prefer my casinos a bit dark and cigarette smoke filled. 

I've always admired the layout of this particular hotel - particularly how the tucked the parking garage under the tower just to perfection as was done with much newer places. No need to have that useless walk and odd tunnels from the garage to the hotel. 

Downtown a fun place to be. Action packed and a more cozy feeling than The Strip. Prices are lower and Fremont Street is looking better than ever. The Plaza also went through a drastic remodel with Furniture from the FountainBleu - a resort that never came to be.

Word on the street is that odds are much better downtown than on the strip too when it comes to the casinos and slot machines. Look closely for payouts on blackjack if you intend to play for any significant amount of time. Lower table limits and better odds are what you are likely to find.",2017-10-07 09:57:05

A forewarning: My review of Flames Central might a bit biased, but here we are anyway.

I have never been to Flames Central to watch a game. Its not everyday that you'll find me at a sports bar watching hockey/football/whatever. Unless its the Habs playing and I'm decked out in my Habs shirt, cheering on Price and Kostitsyn. But that doesnt last very long either..

However, I have been to Flames Central for other events. And I LOVE the venue. The first time I went was for a Timeraiser function, and was impressed right off the bat. The space is HUGE, swanky, and super slick. The staff are great, the decor is sexy, and the drinks come fast. The next time I went to Flames Central was for a Halloween party, and there were live DJs, MCs, the works. Thats when I fell in LOVE with Flames Central. The sound system was off the charts, and the layout was PERFECT for live music and dancing. The crowd was perfect, the lighting was perfect, the music was perfect, and the Djs and MCs blew my mind. The party was probably one of the best I had been to in my life, and I know that if it was any other venue, the vibe would not have been so fantastic. Flames Central houses some of the best acts/concerts in town, and I am so glad this place exists. 

Also, since it is so close to the C-train, it is extremely convenient to get back home after a night of partying or after celebrating a Flames win.",2011-06-07 19:55:49

The parking lot was hourly but they validated parking inside. At the time they had a sale on annual memberships.

This place was crowded on the day that I was there, which surprised me.  Lots of people with computers doing work and a few study groups with toddlers running around.  It seemed cramped and small with all of the people stuffed in there.  Wondering why so many people go there......

After eating/drinking anything/everything bad for the last 2 months I was feeing lethargic, bloated, heavy and just plain blaaaah so I decided it was time to switch it up. A great friend of mine has done a bunch of diets and cleanses and said this place takes the cake so off I went. 

I walked in and told the owner how I felt and to give me whatever he thought was best and I was going to grit my teeth and survive. I paid, left with day one  (6-16oz juices) and went back the following day to pick up days two and three.

Day 1: It was much easier than I thought it would be, I'm a true lover of food  and flavors so usually when I eat it's not about hunger it's just about desire, curiosity and want. I got hangry (hungry/angry) once on day one but drank a bunch of water and it went away. Easy peasy.

Day 2: Same as day one but the hangry hit me earlier than expected so I followed the directions and drank juice number six ahead of juice number five and all was well.

Day 3: Same as day two but the hangry hit me even earlier (probably because I cooked an excellent meal that I couldn't partake in for my family) and since I refuse to give up and eat any solid food I drank half of juice number six after juice number two and the rest is history.

Overall: I won't be doing another cleanse for a while but I achieved my goal in feeling better and I enjoyed every juice but the evil Prestige (:-|) and I look forward to tomorrow which is the first day I can eat food again because I really want to try their poke bowl and a smoothie. I did expect to be on the toilet all day everyday, however, my body didn't react that way, probably because I didn't drink as much water as I should have. Also, I thought I'd be tired but nope, I felt lighter and more energetic when I woke up on day two than I have in months.

ENVIRONMENT: It was a little bit confusing for us as the front of the space is Saryo Cafe and it took us the entire time there to realize they are actually separate entities. We also mistook and went to pay for our ramen at Saryo's register. The Konjiki dining area is at the back with bar tables in the middle and tables of fours surrounding at the side. This restaurant unlike other ramen joints, does not show you how they make their ramen and the kitchen is hidden from the customers. The atmosphere is not as dynamic and lively like Kinton, where their staffs'd greet you loudly in Japanese. 

FOOD: We each ordered a different ramen broth so we could all try each other's flavours together. The Signature clam broth shio was definitely the winner among the four broths we ordered. It had a very strong clam flavour and just extremely tasty. The broth was unique and unlike other broth I've tried. For me, the special Tonkotsu broth came in second, and I wouldn't mind coming in again to order this next time. It was rich and creamy, slightly heavier than the shio clam broth. But the flavour was still excellent. Smokey Black Tonkotsu was interesting and different. One might find it a bit too strong and smokey though. The signature clam broth shoyu was also decent but I found the soy sauce overpowered the taste of the clams. So I much preferred the shio better. The manager on site also gave us some pointers as we were sipping each other's broth. He told us if we took a spoonful of broth from the 3 spots where the toppings were placed, we'd be able to taste slightly different flavour. And, the broth did taste slightly different when soaked with different toppings (e.g green onions). 

The pork here at Konjiki was underwhelming and tasted almost like thin slices of ham. The meal would be that much more perfect if it came with an egg and better meat.

In the end, all of us fought to finish the entire Shio broth. It was that delicious!

SERVICE: no complain here. Just right.

I'd recommend their clam broth shio and special Tonkotsu broth.",2017-12-18 02:51:09

The coffee itself is pretty good, and the prices are competitive. But here are a few reasons why I won't be back:

* Sometimes it's hard to get the owners' attention so I can make a purchase, because they're so focused on interacting with their personal friends. I've had to wait in line while they watch videos together.

* Too much clutter. There are so many knick-knacks, coffee gadgets, books, etc. everywhere that the employees are forced to do food prep on tables in the customer seating area. At least two tables near the front door are always filled with food inventory, baskets, platters, plastic wrap, etc - whatever is needed for prep the staff is working on at the time.

* The more I visit, the more I realize that the place is filthy, really filthy. Tables are often sticky even after they just open, and the floor is a disaster.

My wife went here first and was impressed so I visited this weekend.  The location is new and clean.  The lines are long.  The concept is creating your own piada (basically a wrap), pasta or salad.  You have your choice of protein (chicken, beef, salmon), vegetables and hot and cold sauces or salad dressings.  They also have sides - fried calmari, soup, and piada sticks.  They have cannoli chips for dessert.  They do sell beer and wine, sodas, and your choice of European sodas and iced teas.  I find it very European that their alcohol drinks cost less than your non-alcoholic drinks.  Cute.  You place your order and they assemble your meal and you pay.  My wife ordered chicken and they scooped it out of a hot tray.  I ordered salmon and they cooked it fresh and flavorful.  The service seemed a bit disorganized, maybe because this is a new place.  The pasta was basic angel hair and well made.  The salads were basic lettuce.  Portions were HUGE and fresh.  I can't see coming here for lunch and not bringing food home.  Having smaller portions available would be nice.  We did not (and not many people when we were there) try the Piada.  The toppings and sauces were fresh, but a bit skimpy.  I could have used more cheese and sauce.  Also, if you want pepper on your salad, better bring your own because they don't have any.  The wine was flavorful for the price.  The european fountain drinks were a nice touch.  The dining room is modest size, but we had no problem finding a place to sit.  You bus your own trays when done, but one of the people cleaning tables offered to take ours.  Nice touch.  Overall, good, but not great experience.  Unique, fresh food, decent service.

The problem with having food with a movie is that the acoustics in the theaters are fairly loud. You can literally hear every tinkle the fork hitting the plates make, and the soundproofing is not good enough to drown out the thundering noise the parking lot downstairs makes nor the club music they start pumping out around 11 on weekends. So this certainly takes a lot of the atmosphere out of what would otherwise be an enjoyable affair.

I know not much left to review. My first impression was like different vibe in no way feel like your traditional coffee shop. Not only do they have traditional pastries in really display case, also have glass jars of pastries, and then comes to food. They really have nice variety of sandwiches from hot or cold. The 24/7. I know of one Starbucks that open 24/7 so having more then one option plus with more food options. MadHouse Mahalos! The decor hard described modern with twist...maybe. The two monkeys in suit straight out of pulp fiction cool decoration. Original artwork that believe you can buy if you want. The counter area next to barista making all the java art. Different spot chill at not only do you get see all the magic happen but relaxing spot read good book. Me coffee and good book go hand in hand. 

The menu like that chalkboard. I know they have few signature drinks. I figure start with the matcha green tea. It was awesome. One thing that feel stood out compare other coffee spots same one. The color was vibrant green, smooth, and flavor amazing. The red velvet that one need try next cause never heard of that one before. So like the creative MadHouse offers for java lovers!! 

The staff is five stars awesome. The gentlemen took my order explaining the menu being my first time. Notice wearing my Colorado Avalanche Forsberg jersey. Next thing know talking hockey stories. It was cool. I think of great coffee shop not only about great java, great spot random conversations, read great book mention earlier, and MadHouse definitely has all of those things.

Since it's a little over 10 minutes from my office, I decided to try ordering from Grubhub for the first time. Before I placed my order it said ""total time will be 30-40 mins"". AFTER I placed the order it turned into 90 mins! Yikes! So.. I decided to cancel my Grubhub order and just go to the place directly.

I drive the 10+ minutes, park, and when I walk inside there is a huuuge line and only one person working the counter. I'm waiting for at least 10 minutes which seems silly - why not have at least one more person working the register so they can handle the crowd more? On top of that, the person at the counter was also taking ordering calls so we had to wait for her to finish making the line move even slower. I was almost ready to bail but since I had waited this long (and made the trek), I decided to stay.

When I finally got up to the front, ordering was thankfully fairly smooth. I got my food to go and when I asked, I was told it would be another 15 minutes for it to be ready. I wish the lady behind the counter would have volunteered that information instead of me having to ask after I placed the order. But once again, I'm already committed, so might as well ..
 
Ordering food to-go is kind of weird because they don't give you a number and there's really no where to sit and wait. I didn't want to take up a spot at the table for people dining in since it was already crowded, but I didn't want to stand because it was gonna be at least 15 minutes? So the whole thing just felt weird and clunky. I saw a lot of people get to-go orders so I would have thought they'd have a better process.

After a few minutes, I decided to check on my order, and I found that my original Grubhub order was actually made instead of being cancelled. I panicked because I had just placed an order for the same exact thing. The lady at the register assured me my order had been cancelled and so I wouldn't be charged (even though it was made). At the same time, the order I had placed a few minutes ago came out, so she packaged that. While I thought she would just give me the second cancelled order as a nice gesture since it was already there and ready, she instead put it to the side and had zero interest in offering it to me. This was a huge disappointment as other places happily offer me ""mistake orders"" all the time. I mean the food wasn't cheap to begin with. But, since I had to get back to work, I didn't want to fight it.

And as for the food? It was just okay, but definitely not worth the hassle. The steak was decent but the lamb was super tough. I got it medium - which the lady recommended - so I don't know if it should have been cooked less or what. I was also REALLY hyped about the feta fries, but when I got them they were way too cheesy. They also didn't taste very feta to me? If you love cheese then you'll be fine, but if you're looking for more crispy fries with feta accents (like other places I've been to), I think you'll be disappointed.

Anyhow i love my panang curry there because the sauce isn't soupy or too thick. it is perfect and i can never get enough.

The jackfruit tacos had crispy bits of taro (amazing) and the jackfruit had the texture of pulled pork! The flavour could have been more powerful, or I wish we had hot sauce available on the side. 

I tried a bite of the burger, and the texture/taste was a close as possible to a real meat burger. The size of the burger and even the bun was pretty small in comparison to regular burgers though.

He showed me what they had and told me the benefits of each one. He was very informative on the products and showed me their products. After asking several questions and looking at what they had I chose the Troy floating rail system. Then Jeff the gun smith came to talk to me and explained to me what he had to do to install it. This guy was very helpful and made me confident on my choice of rail. So I left my AR there so Jeff can install it for me. Later that day Jeff called me to let me know he was done with the install.

We ended up here after driving around for about an hour looking for a place that didn't have a two hour wait and I've had good experiences here before so I was sure it'd be a nice night out when the hostess said she could seat us right away. Man was I wrong. We started with the Lobster Mac & Cheese. The cheesiest thing about the dish was the ritz cracker crust on top. I realize that sounds very sad, that's because it is. The lobster was great on it's own and there were decent chunks throughout the dish. The mac part though? It really could've just said lobster with pasta in a cream sauce and I probably would've believed them. Not very cheesy and kind of runny instead of a glorious gooey concoction I was hoping for. I finished it off though and good thing too because I ordered the wagyu burger and I managed about 2-3 bites before I gave up due to how hard it was to eat combined with how flavorless and dry the meat was. That thing tasted like pure disappoint if disappointment had a taste. I ended up eating some of my dining partner's pulled pork ravioli, and dipping my fries in the sauce.

Our waiter was friendly if a little slow on taking orders and water refills. Pacing of the meal was spot on, the appetizers came out shortly after our order was filled and entrees came shortly afterwards I like that they pay attention to timing. However I gotta say he was really turning a blind eye to customer satisfaction. He saw that I didn't like or eat my burger, and didn't want to take it home, and I even said out loud when he was clearing the table ""What a disappointment"" and he just went on merrily clearing plates returning a short time later to see if we wanted dessert. No thanks I'd just like to leave and go get a burger at cookout so I can stop being hungry.

This has left a very bad impression on my friend and I find myself hard pressed to make a return trip here now after this experience. I am sad that I pretty much ate a $14 piece of pickle and fries for dinner. So two stars means Meh. I've experienced better. You know where I've experienced better?

Not many places are actually nice to sit in when you start to weigh in things the way I do. I don't want to wait in a line or sit outside waiting for my name to be called or reserve way ahead of time. I don't like it when places look like subway inside if I am on a date no matter how good the food. I haven't been to Pizzeria Bianco for example for one of the reasons mentioned.

Service: 5/5 I don't recall ever waiting for a check or a drink for too long and even when the occasional mix up happens they remedy it promptly

Pricing: I would really expect to pay more for food this good.

Ambiance: 5/5 I love dining out here, they softly play old school hip-hip and trip-hop is present but you wouldn't here it unless you are trying. The city of phoenix art work on one of the walls is terrible but the rest of the decor is nice.

Food:
Winner Salad w/ balsamic(homemade): 5/5 It is the best salad I have had. I cant stand the lemon vinaigrette version of this salad though( I dont like lemon on much though). I stumbled onto the balsamic due to a side salad having it once now I special order it this way all the time as it is the best damned salad ever.

rb&c: 4/5 This is a solid sandwich that I order every now and then, in the end it is just a sandwich though.

vegetarian chilli- 1/5 stay away unless bland is your desire, it is quite terrible.

Cheese plate - 5/5 I usually don't go for appetizers in the modern cuisine era as most of it is sub par but this goes in the hall of fame of appetizers. 

Artichoke dip- 4/5 pretty good stuff also

olives: 3/5 Lolas Tapas had some 5/5 ones but are now closed.:(

Drinks:
I love little bottles of ginger-ale and the hefeweizen

Our experience this morning was similar to Larry K.'s review. However, we weren't even given a wait time or a chance to be put on a guest list. The answer was simply, ""no, we are full"", even with three empty tables in sight.

In the middle of arguing with the hostess ( an older white haired lady ) to try and figure this mash out, a middle aged woman ( entitled soccer mom looking lady who claimed to be the owner; she's not ) tried to jump in to resolve the situation and ended up trying to reprimand my boyfriend. 

Here's a tip: you're a new restaurant. Every customer should be equally as important to you. Plus, you should understand the whole situation before you jump in and assume the worst of people. 

I was a hostess for six years. When there is a wait the first thing you tell the patron is the wait estimate and then you offer to put their names on a guest list. This is fundamental and was not communicated to us. You cannot blame a patron for getting upset when we asked for this information several times and were just told ""the restaurant is full.""

I was a little offended at the comment, I'm not going to lie to you. I am 28 year old professional but am constantly mistaken for a teenager- I think he judged us based on my ""age"" and our voucher. 

After that initial snafu his service was fairly good while he was around. He seemed genuinely interested in our opinions on the menu and food. Had the beef tar tar, which could have been better. The taste of Dijon mustard was very strong and the meat was cut up almost to mush (rather than small chunks). Waiter changed shifts while we were eating but we were never told and were made to wait a long time. 

The restaurant crowd wasn't my style either. Seemed like accomplished mid life adults who care a lot about $ and image. I prefer a more down to earth crowd (despite $ or age) and atmosphere- this could have just been the night we went (Tuesday). Food was good  but seemed slightly off mark. I expected better based on the reputation and price. 

I honestly felt like we were given the ""pretty woman"" young+poor treatment. Guess you can't tell by looking at us that we have good dual incomes and no children to eat up our $.

On searching out the location, we were not impressed with the location...located in the corner of a nearly dead strip mall...we thought this was the hidden gem in the Tempe italian world.  We were somewhat embarassed after we ordered, especially with friends from Milan in our party.

On pulling up to the restaurant, we walked in and waited at the 'seating stand'.  The waitress came after about 5 minutes (she was working to deliver orders to the folks at tables), asking how many were dining and where we would like to sit.  We let her know we were ordering to go, and she motioned us to the bar.

On arriving at the bar and not sitting, we were asked if we were ordering to go or to eat in.  We let the person requesting our order know that we would be ordering to go.  She brought up her pen and order pad and asked what we would order.  We ordered a mushroom/pepperoni/sausage pie sufficient for 4.  Waitress asked if we would wait for our order, and when we said we would go to Big Lots in the same mall, she said we would wait 35-40 minutes for our order.  

We walked out and down to Big Lots, finding a few items we could not pass up.  Leaving Big Lots at 30 minutes after we placed our order, we proceeded to put our purchases in the vehicle and headed back to the restaurant to pick up dinner.  When we arrived, the waitress advised we were early, and would we like a beer or glass of wine while we waited.  We declined and stood waiting for the pizza we ordered.

What was delivered 10 minutes later was a 12-inch pie.  While we anticipated a pizza that was sufficiently loaded to take care of 4 people dining, we were sadly disappointed.  We took the pizza we ordered and drove a mile to the homestead.  When we arrived and opened the box, we were all underwhelmed at the toppings.  There were 2 strips of sausage, 5 pepperoni slices and 5 mushroom slices.  

While I was reminded that we should have opened the box at the restaurant, I replied that we should give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt.  Was I mistaken?  ABSOLUTELY!  Being hungry, I resisted the normal 'check it out before leaving' concept. 

$19.25 for a 12"" pizza with such minimal toppings, I was directed to return to the restaurant with the insufficient pizza.  On arriving back at the restaurant, I was told that since I left before lodging my dissatisfaction, nothing would be done about the order I placed, as I might have ""peeled toppings off to express my dissatisfaction"". 

If you want to spend too much money for a pizza, this is the place to go.",2011-12-04 09:22:18

- desserts can be a hit or miss

They closed off the back dining area with partitions and since there were just 20 of us, there was a lot of space. The service was great! We had 2-3 servers and runners bringing food and making sure our drinks stayed full. It was a good time. 

Crab, Spinach, and Artichoke Dip ($13.75): Served with pico de gallo and tortilla chips. This was a nice dip. Good flavors and the crab managed to come through. 

Seafood Stuffed Mushrooms ($11.75): Roasted Cremini mushrooms, mushroom cream, and parmesan. The mushrooms had a lot of stuffing, which was nice, but I didn't really care for the overall dish.

Crispy Onion Strings and Jalapeños ($8.75): Really thin fried onion strings piled high with red bell peppers and ranch dressing. These were tasty!

Firecracker Shrimp ($10.50): Tempura-fried shrimp with a creamy sweet chili glaze. I think we've all had this shrimp somewhere. I've had it at Bonefish Grill and the clubhouse at Anthem Country Club. I don't think the dish even had different names and they always taste the same. Anyway, I know it's terribly unhealthy, but that glaze is delicious and it's fantastic with the tempura shrimp. I love it!

Famous Salad Bowl: Served with all entrees. I didn't see it on the menu a la carte. I don't know what type of dressing is used, but I did not like it. Plus, I hate when my salad is drenched with dressing. It's so unappetizing. The bowl was actually FILLED with dressing after the salad was removed. The contents of the salad were unmemorable.

Shrimp Jambalaya ($21.75): The usual suspects, Andouille sausage, shrimp, Tasso ham, okra; served with Jasmine rice. Ruben and I love Jambalaya and we usually order it if it's on the menu. This one was all right. I didn't like the broth which was sweeter than I prefer.

Ribeye ($32.75): Chargrilled and served with a Salt-Crusted Baked Potato. The steak was disappointedly thin. Not enough flavor. The potato was decent.

Bananas Foster: The sauce was placed in a separate container to pour over the vanilla ice cream; fantastic since I hate when the ice cream is completely melted. Although, the ice cream was placed in a thin fried bowl that was disgusting and inedible. It reeked of old, overused frying oil and whatever was fried in it (like our appetizers). I can't believe they would use the same oil to fry their seafood and their desserts. So gross.

Cinnamon Bread Pudding: The flavors weren't bad (mostly due to the tasty caramel sauce), but the bread pudding itself wasn't very good. The bread was really dense and didn't have much flavor or moisture. It was just a large cube of compacted bread.

Key Lime Pie: I found the pie much too sweet with not enough tang from the key lime. Which is odd since I find a lot of key lime pies too sour!

Accommodations were fantastic and the staff was wonderful. The food, on the other hand, left much to be desired. It wasn't my cup of tea. Unexpectedly, I did enjoy a couple dishes, but they weren't enough to overcome the rest of the lackluster meal.",2015-01-21 19:34:01

Sunflower Market is a refreshing change from the generic drag of most supermarkets.  The store is laid out much like a market would be, with islands of produce, a fish monger and butcher, and only a few aisles.  It is a relaxing layout compared to Smiths and Albertsons.

As far as the quality of produce and meats here, it is generally better than Smiths and Albertsons, and competetively priced.  Whole Foods has the best (        ) fill in the blank, but the prices also reflect this.  

Sunflower Market boasts that they carry ""Natural"" meats.  I find this term to be entirely ambiguous.  What does natural mean?  Is the meat still intensively farmed?  How were the animals treated?  When I asked the butcher, he had little answers for me.  I will say it generally looks better than what you may find elsewhere, but I'm not sold its better quality.

Jim G. and I posted up at the bar for some Saturday afternoon brunch.  Our server, Mallory, came over to get a drink order. Jim G. was famished so he also started us with some Deviled Eggs right away.

The Deviled Eggs came out and were tasty.  The portion, while only being 4 eggs, is huge, since the 'deviled' part is piled might high!  It took close to 20 minutes to get Mallory's attention so that we could order our actual food. Sitting at the bar, we would've expected it to be much easier to get someone.  Sadly, she was at the other end of the bar talking with another bartender or someone.  

When we did order, we got the Fried Chicken, Watermelon, and Waffles.  Huge portion!  We shared half a friend chicken!  The chicken was super good. It was very moist and the meat had great flavor.  I do believe the oil could have been a tiny bit hotter, so that it'd be a bit less greasy, but it was still good.  The spiced watermelon was awesome!  The waffles, however, were a bit of a letdown.  Seemingly lacking in real flavor and not all that crisp.  They made me want the waffles at Bouchon!

We had lots of other time basically getting ignored by Mallory and had to flag down someone else for more drinks and, eventually, our check. The getting ignored at the bar was especially detrimental to our ability to enjoy our time there.  Mallory, another bartender, and what looked like a manager spent about 15 minutes seemingly deciding where to put bourbon bottles on display.  Perhaps it's better in the main dining room, but my experience is usually that sitting at the bar is the way to go.  

If I ate more carbs, I might be more willing to go back to try them again.  As it is, I'm not so sure.",2015-05-29 19:13:40

Despite all this the staff are very patient and helpful and friendly. Everything looked so good. 
But as my usual, I had to test out their almond croissant. It was cut in half and there was a filling. I must say it was pretty good, though not what I was expecting. I can't really compare it to my fav a.c @ cherry bomb. The filling is actually like a cake. The texture intrigued me. Quite delicious. The right amount of sweetness without over doing it. It had the right flakiness on the outside and soft in the middle. Not as moist nor chewy as cherry bombs but I wouldn't call it dry. Almond croissant would be a 7.5-8.5/10 ( cherry bomb is a 10). 
Any hoots , got some pasta salad as well - so yum! And what I like the most is the home made pasta. Right density and flavor.

The club sandwich is large and thick, enough to fill up any person together with fries.  The ox tail rice unexpectedly the ox tail is cut into very thick pieces so it looks piling up on the rice.  The ox tail is very well cooked and tender but the tip you can still taste a bit of the raw tail - can be done better.  The chicken comes with a salad and rice and the portion is large.

I found the cafe cozy- nice, dark wood furniture and dark wood blinds.  Definitely more welcoming than the restaurants in Chandler!  I found the high counter a little daunting- I, being only 5 feet tall, had to either hoist myself up on the counter with my elbows to peer down, or had to crouch down to have a look under the counter, and have a look through the sneeze-guard.  Their labeling system needs improvement: I vote for adhesive labels that go on the sneeze-guard so that patrons can easily identify the food on the buffet line.  I'm sorry, but no matter how often Karey and Purine say they like to cook the food to order, food laid out in huge trays and placed in ""turo-turo"" style ISN'T food cooked-to-order!

Here is a list of the food I tried that day:

1. Lechon, large order $6.99- includes corn tortilla (I subbed flour) and  choice of Spanish or Filipino garlic rice.  (I chose Filipino, of course!) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=SHZJN-BYDlPa74nDjqH2xg#SHZJN-BYDlPa74nDjqH2xg

2. 3-entree combo of Dinuguan (""chocolate stew""), Beef Mechado, and Pork Adobo $- includes garlic rice.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=Pcxd22BrQ9Ixjgm13149fQ#Pcxd22BrQ9Ixjgm13149fQ

3. Lumpia shanghai (fried Filipino pork eggrolls)- small order includes 8 pcs. of pork- and onion-filled mini-eggrolls that are fried.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=HyJX4evw0Ogej34RgcptkQ#HyJX4evw0Ogej34RgcptkQ

4. Halo-halo $4.50- frozen dessert consisting of sweet beans, coconut strings, coco jellies, ube (taro-based pudding), coconut milk, choice of ice cream, and shaved ice.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=cphMBWm29BPKoaBidq9QCA#cphMBWm29BPKoaBidq9QCA

5. Pan of cassava $8- Cassava is a root, much like a sweet potato or yam that is pounded or ground into flour and then mixed with cream, butter, eggyolks, and sugar and baked/steamed into a cake-like dessert dish.  Somewhat cakey and much thicker than an egg-custard pie... A little help here, Joel?  

6.  To-go containers of Pork adobo and Dinuguan, each $3

I found all the entrees and eggrolls, save the mechado (meat was a little tough), very tender and very tasty (loved the dinuguan!).  However, they're ALL very greasy, unfortunately!  I'll never ever order the fried eggrolls again... Everytime I ate them, they came back to haunt me, and all due to the high grease and salt content.  A coworker came for her first visit (with her husband and stepdaughter. as well) after I had left, and told me that she found the eggrolls VERY salty, as well as the other dishes she tried there, but couldn't bring herself to tell the owners because they were all so very friendly and sweet.  Karen, Rey, and Purine, as well as Michael, were all very friendly and accomodating, this is true.

I would order the dinuguan and pork adobo again, but I won't eat any of it until I'm able to place them in the fridge so that their sauces may gel up and I can skim off the HUGE amount of fat, reheat, and then place them back into the fridge again so that I may re-skim the fat one more time.  Only then would I be able to enjoy these dishes.  They are very tasty, but I have to be careful...  Or I could enjoy them fresh, but without much of the sauce.

What my coworker and I definitely agreed on was that we'd both come back just to have the halo-halo again!  This dessert, similar to the Vietnamese Che ba mau, tasted like it was made from fresh ingredients, instead of from a bottled mix of beans, coco strings and jello.  I liked the ice cream they used, too.  You have your choice of either ube, vanilla, or mango.  I'll definitely have to come back and try a bowl of the two Filipino flavors...  As a special, Karen had prepared ginataan, a warm dessert consisting of plantains, jackfruit, coco strings, taro, and something akin to yams, cooked in coconut milk and sugar.  This looked and smelled so very good, but I couldn't try it due to food allergies.  I wonder if Joel had a sample?  I know he enjoyed the cassava... I did, likewise.

As for the lechon, I'm sad to report that the skin wasn't crispy at all, and I detected a chemical flavor every time I tried the skin.  It tasted much like what a disinfectant might taste like.  A faint hint, but still there, nonetheless.  The pork meat didn't wow me, either.  A big part of the enjoyment of lechon is the Mang Tomas Lechon sauce, which you can buy at Lee Lee supermarket in Chandler (or at Mekong in Mesa).  Awesome sauce, just ask Joel!  I'll have to try the leftover lechon soon with the sauce (I stayed away from it bec. I wasn't sure of the ingredients at the time).

I will definitely be back to try their daily specials.  I do hope that Karen and the others strive to lessen the grease content of their dishes...",2009-08-11 07:06:31

Been coming here since they opened many years ago and I can't believe I forgot to review this place! This is not your typical burger joint!

So, the concept is simple. They serve all kinds of burgers and exotic meats (ostrich, venison, rabbit etc.) as sliders or full size burgers. I always get 2 sliders so I can try different things. The exotics change all the time so be sure to ask what's available. 

They have a good happy hour deal on sliders but only a few meats are available at that price. Loved everything I had here. Sloppy Joe brought me back to my childhood. Short rib...just a hair shy of being food crack! Fantastic fries too, never had a bad meal here.

Oh, and most importantly (just kidding) when I bring the kiddos they love coming in through the back door. It's not hinged at the wall so it opens funny. Slim opening my kids go through and normal width for us. Kinda cool..just sayin'",2017-11-09 00:14:51

Macaron ($2.25): Avocado, Tarragon, Balsamic, Chocolate Salted Chip, Vanilla Raspberry, Chocolate Caramel, and Cilantro. The macarons are on point. Perfectly chewy with great fillings and the flavors are so much fun! I've really enjoyed the more unique flavors such as avocado, tarragon, balsamic, and cilantro. I didn't really care for the other flavors though.

Basque ($5): Classic and Apricot. This was my first experience with Gateau Basque or Basque Cake and I am obsessed. It seriously speaks to me. I love its slightly cake-y texture with a cross of a tart (especially with the almond flavor) and I looove the almost custard-like pastry cream. I was also fortunate to have the Classic Basque fresh out of the oven and it was heaven. They frequently mix the pastry cream with a fruit filling and although I'm not as much of a fan of that situation, the apricot was nice.

Croissant ($3.75): I've only had the Black Truffle Croissants (like 6 of them..) and that's all I'll ever need. Admittedly, I wish it had a little more truffle in it, but don't we all wish there was more truffle everywhere? I just take them home and add a little Black Truffle Salt before consumption. YUUUUUMM.

Canelé ($3.50): Another first for me and I'm already such a big fan of French pastries (and French everything, really). The inside is supposed to be sort of custard-y and the exterior has a caramelized crust. The French are brilliant! Haha, I love the crunchy, chewy exterior with the soft, moist interior. Really good stuff.

Gelato: I've tested a few flavors, but I've only ever ordered a scoop of the Chocolate & Mascarpone Gelato because it was just too amazing. So creamy and yummy. I love mascarpone.

Oh man, why does 346 have to be SO FAR from me?!? Sigh, it's probably a good thing for my waist and wallet. Lately, I've been trying to find any reason to go to 346 when I'm anywhere near the Henderson area. It doesn't work out often, but I'm so excited when I do get to go. Mostly for the surprise of flavors that'll be available, but I definitely have my favorites now. Basques and Caneles are a must for me now and definitely macarons. Ooh, and eclairs. French pastries FTW!

Last night my plan was to walk from the Mint Museum all the way down to Harvest Moon then come back to tour the Mint.  Then I remember Tonya P. (P for PopRock Photography aka POPROCK LOVE) told me that the Restaurant in the Mint was good and I should check it out... Being 90 + degrees outside and not really wanting to walk I looked at the menu posted outside.  As I was reading the menu a guy from inside came out to bring me in!  Boldness is to be rewarded!!!

Like its Filmmakers' brethren, it shows a lot of art, foreign, & indie films that you can't see anywhere else.  Oddly enough, it was once known as the Arts Cinema when it was a porno house.  

I mainly go to the Regent Square for my artier fare, as well as the Manor (when they get a good indie).  I've got a Screenie Pass to any PGH Filmmaker cinema, which is good for 12 admissions and 12 popcorns and beverages.  I came here to see ""The Interrupters"", a documentary by the same folks that did ""Hoop Dreams"".  ""The Interrupters"" was filmed in Chicago takes an intimate look at the stubborn, persistence of urban gang violence. The ""Interrupters"" are a group of ex-convicts who've joined CeaseFire, an innovative organization determined to stop by getting  out on the streets and  resolving conflict. 

Believe me folks, this movie is an eye-opener and extremely worth seeing.  Much better than anything Michael Moore could have done.

J494T-6nS9rkrXtdE8fC2w,b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,4iB4J5fxd8tbYklDAnaD5g,4,10,1,1,"This is the second time I've stayed at Tahiti Village. One of my friends owns a timeshare here and offered me the use of his timeshare. Last year, I stayed at Tahiti Village for approximately 8 days in room 2611 (Tower 2, 6th floor) which is one of the Bora Bora suite. This year, I stayed at Tahiti Village for 7 days in room 5210 (Tower 5, 2nd floor) which is also a Bora Bora suite. Bora Bora suites are fully furnished with washing machine, dryer, full kitchen (stove, microwave, kitchen, fridge, freezer, dishwasher), a steamer shower, a jacuzzi/jet bathtub, two televisions (living room area and bedroom), and a DVD player.

I arrived at around 5:00pm on a Tuesday and there was no line-up for check-in. When I checked in, I was informed about a hold on my credit card for possible incidentals which I informed them that it would be fine. As the lady was checking me in, I asked if it was possible to be in the same tower as the fitness center. The reason for this is that I normally go to the fitness center in the morning and last year when I was staying in Tower 2, this meant walking out in shorts & t-shirt at 5:00am in the morning (5:00am in Las Vegas in the morning could be around 4C (39F) in January) since the Towers are not interconnected but are separate buildings and it can be cold (or raining). She informed me that it wasn't an issue.

In terms of my room in 5210, it was very nice. Last year there were a few issues with my room (2611) which I was glad that I didn't experience this year. For example, last year the clothes dryer would stop after running for 1 minute so it didn't dry my clothes and the dish washer leaked during the cleaning cycle (which I only found out on the last day when I used it as opposed to handwashing the pots/dishes/utensils. This year, I didn't experience those issues.

There is a balcony in room 5210 but unlike the great view that I had last year in 2611, the view from 5210 is to the garbage dumpsters and an internal parking lot for their shuttle buses so I didn't really use the balcony.

I enjoyed my stay in the room. For those of you not familiar with Tahiti Village, you don't get daily housekeeping service but if you're staying for 7 days (or more), they will send housekeeping at the half-way point. This doesn't really bother me. The safety deposit box requires a key and is not the code-type boxes. It is only about 2 inches deep and although I didn't measure it, I would say it was maybe 10"" x 10"".

They offer shuttle services to/from the Strip daily at roughly 30 minute intervals, stopping at Tropicana and the Mirage before heading back to Tahiti Village. They also offer grocery shuttle service roughly 3 times a week in the morning, shuttle service to/from Fremont Experience once/twice a week, and shuttle service to Red Rock Canyon (cost $5). On the day that I was on the shuttle to Red Rock Canyon, because of the rain and wind from the previous day, Red Rock Canyon was closed in the morning so the bus turned back after waiting approximately 30 minutes for them to open (but they didn't). I didn't have any issues with the shuttle service except once I wanted to go on the shuttle to the Strip and the bus was completely full so I either had to wait 30 minutes for the next shuttle or use alternate means to get to the Strip. I didn't have any issues with the wireless in my room.

The parking lot near the towers fills up fast since part of the parking is also used by Denny's. There is a tier level parking further away from the Towers that can be used.

My only negative comments regarding my stay and/or Tahiti Village is that the property should have better labels on door/gate entrances and exits. For example, on my first day, I wanted to get to Tower 5 but taking the side entrance, I saw a door and used my door card to get in (carrying my luggage) and I wound up in Tower 2. Also, when coming out of the elevators in Tower 5, there are ~3 exits with the concierge table in the center of Tower 5 (which is often empty either due to lunch hours or due to evenings or early mornings when it is not staffed), if you take the wrong exit, you could wind up going around a longer route just to get to the main building lobby in order to get to the shuttle bus. Another negative comment that I have is in regards to the DVD player and controls. There should be instructions on how to use the DVD player. I changed the channel to the DVD channel and played a DVD but nothing was displayed. I looked on the remote control for the television and could not find anything to change the source/feed for the television. They had to send someone to my room in order to show me how to use the DVD player since the people in the front (neither the concierge nor the front desk) knew how to use the DVD player. When they sent someone to my room, I was informed that there is a toggle on the bottom of the television set to switch the input to HDMI2 in order to play the DVD.

I give them a 4 stars.",2017-01-29 19:55:23

I would love to come back and try something new! The only reason I didn't give a 5 star was because I asked if it would be spicy and I was told no but it was still too spicy for me!

I love the Tikka Kabab Kandhari (boneless chicken comes out a-la-fajitas-style - sizzling with onions) and I order Nan and a side of the yogurt cucumber sauce. Then I make myself Nan tacos. (I hope I'm not making anyone cringe - but it's great and there's no food better than one you can eat with your hands!) 

The location is odd, but I guess, after 3 years of being out here, I'm getting use to restaurants being in strip malls. The price of the food is reasonable - especially for dinner. 

I took one of our Australian friends, who had recently moved to the States from London. He loved the food, and was thoroughly engage in a conversation with our waiter about cricket. (I kinda zoned out and watched the Bollywood music videos until they finished.)

I was told the house special chicken is the thing to try at China Chili. However, after looking at the menu, and discovering an item by the name of pillow chicken that included the phrase ""pillow shaped morsels"" how could I resist? There was none of that resistance crap. That food was in my belly fast! The pillow chicken was chicken mixed with onion, bamboo shoot and I believe something else and breaded into little pillow sized wonder. It was laid on top of steamed broccoli and then covered in a black pepper sauce. I wish it was spiced with something more than pepper, but other than that I have no complaints. It was so filling (in the good way, not the I'm gonna get sick way like most Chinese I have) I was only able to eat half. 

I loved the huge round tables in the center with the lazy susans. They reminded me of ones at a fantastic restaurant near where I grew up. The inside is really spacious and has some fantastic traditional decor. The menu was so large that I found several things I'd like to try next time including a whole section of chow fun food. Fun? Yep. I'd like some.

We walk in and were told that there's a 45-minute wait.  Okay, so it was a Friday night--this is understandable.  We put our name down and wait outside.  Three minutes later the hostess informs us that our table is ready.  Interesting.

We were seated at a community table next to some older men who were drinking martinis and eating appetizers.  I'm not sure if we got shafted with this one.  I had to put my precious Kate Spade bag on the floor because there were no extra stools or hooks to hang it on.  That in itself made me want to leave. 

The menu consists of fish, ribs, chicken, salads, sandwiches and a few a la carte sides.  The items are pricey and the portions are small.  The tuna poke appetizer was bigger than my ahi tuna salad entree.  I was most impressed with the poke; the tuna and shrimp were incredibly fresh and there was a nice kick of acidity.  

Our waiter said that the ahi tuna salad was ""lighter"" but reassured me that the portion size would fill me up.  Liar!  I wish there were three times more greens on the plate.  The salad was quite tasty but the ahi was a little overdone for my taste.  I enjoyed the soy ponzu vinaigrette and I requested some wasabi on the side for a kick.  Sadly, there was no ginger on site to accompany the tuna.  We had to grab a second dinner in Old Town to feel fully satisfied.  

The crowd here isn't exactly my generation...we were youngest couple in the entire place.  I could return, but there are many other place I'd like to try before I do.  It's a good place to go if you're older and want a light bite.",2012-01-07 18:27:01

I was in town for a conference but my hubby tagged along to do some sightseeing in Montreal. I felt lucky to snag a reservation on a Monday evening, considering many people think of Chuck Hughes is a culinary god in Montreal. I originally had dinner reservations for 9pm but my work commitments that night ended a little earlier so I called the restaurant to see if I can bump up our time slot - and they were so accommodating! They said they can fit us in an hour earlier! 

We walked from our hotel (Le Westin Montreal - superb, btw) to Old Montreal to find the restaurant.  I did hear that it's not clearly marked and it's easy to walk right by, so we were careful to look at the address numbers.  

Le Bremner is located on the basement level of an old building so it's a fairly steep set of steps down - watch your head for you tall folks! But once inside, it's a cool, cozy and casual vibe.  It's fairly small - so reservations are highly suggested. We checked in with the maître d' and were seated right away.  

The menu is in both French and English and leans heavily on the seafood side. We shared the crab kimchi toast to start and I ordered the turbot fillet with fiddleheads in an meuniere sauce and my husband ordered the arctic char. Oh my -  everything was outstanding! We finished off dinner with dessert - the pancakes with Pimm's butter for me and the chocolate pot de creme for my husband - they too were fantastic! 

As far as service- the servers were accommodating to our English-speaking needs :) and they were friendly and attentive. We enjoyed our dinner there and we are already plotting our next visit to Montreal.

The new location is upstairs by a Foot Locker on Yonge, after the old one burned down. I've never tried the old location but I've been told the food quality has gone down with the new one. Salad King is always busy with a lot of customers sitting down or grabbing takeout. The food service is fast, so it's ok if you're in a bit of a rush.

I am a huge fan of the shrimp pad thai and hot thai noodles, with those menu items usually being my order. Have also tried the mango chicken rice before and wasn't a huge fan, although it was decent. Portions for the noodles are very large and I'm usually unable to finish the entire dish. Sometimes it can even make for next day's lunch or a snack later on in the night. Prices are ok at around $10.50 for the pad thai. For a dinner for two it usually comes up to around $24.00.

Although I'm sure there are many other thai-style restaurants that boast better food and authenticity, I am always pleased with Salad King and have come here more than 18 times the past school year alone. I do have friends that do not like Salad King, so I suppose it's a hit or miss.

Typical HK Cha ""Chan tang"" kinda place but it didn't disappoint. The prices are a steal for the amount of food you get, but that's typical of all Chinese restaurants like this. They have cheap lunch specials that come with a drink (lemon tea, milk tea or soya milk). I really enjoy the beef ho-fun here but not so much the Cantonese style chow neon (these two dishes are my staples I usually order). The ""Ha Moon"" vermicelli is good too. 

Came here with the family last week for dinner and we were all pleasantly surprised. Waiter recommended the set dinners as we were getting indecisive about the single dishes. Set dinner for 4 came with chicken, steamed fish, lobster and bok choy for 51.99 I believe ( was too tired to look at the menu and just let my parents do the ordering). Everything tasted great! I'm MSG sensitive and he starter soup didn't have as much as other restaurants. The lobster wasn't overly salty and even my brother enjoyed it (literally finger licking good).

pEiFKMZZ8mPQY9p3jKZr1w,s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,LJt-NO2FhvQxTmBoaaLhTg,4,2,3,2,"I introduced two more people to Three Angry Wives' Corned Beef & Cabbage, and sampled the lean meat and delicate buttered cabbage again myself. It was just as delicious, tender, and pleasing to the palate as in previous visits. But this time I was focused on trying the Beef Stroganoff, which comes with either egg noodles or baked potato. I opted for the noodles, which were prepared al dente. 

I can't rave about the Beef Stroganoff as much as the Corned Beef & Cabbage. But, as presented with a generous supply of soft beef tips without any fat in sight, and big chunks of mushrooms, in a savory brown sauce that can perhaps best be described as saucy, it was quite tasty for a time. But, rather than being cooked into this dish, sour cream was placed on the plate in a small plastic container. I suppose this is fine for a diner who knows what he or she is doing. But I was perplexed about how much sour cream to add. Since Beef Stroganoff is not really stroganoff without some sour cream included, I knew I had to add some. But I didn't want to go over the tipping point of good taste. So, I tried my best, cautiously tossing in two spoonfuls, which spiced things up a small notch. Yet I would rather have had the chef decide how much sour cream was best for me. Like all entrees here, this one was very large. (For example, one pound of corned beef and half a head of cabbage is used for a single order of Corned Beef & Cabbage.) So, by the time I finished the last noodle (I generally clean my plate, probably because of my mother's repeated admonitions around the family dinner table many years ago when I put down my fork too soon that ""People are starving in China!""), the sauce seemed bland and the dish a bit boring. 

Preceding delivery of entrees, a cup of Southwestern Soup featuring tiny black beans, bits of corn, and melted tortilla strips in a tangy and cheesy broth was quite tasty. Caesar Salad, prepared with fresh Romaine Lettuce and crunchy croutons enrobed in a nice, light creamy Caesar dressing, was satisfying. And a side of coleslaw was juicy and refreshing. Cheesy Tater Skins arrived with the entrees and contained a bit too much potato on the bottom, and one skin offered insufficient bacon on top. But they, too, were tasty.  Garlic bread was only fair. 

I hadn't eaten all day, so despite the large portions, a dessert seemed in order. So, I ordered a Hot Fudge Sundae. When it arrived I was stunned by its appearance: half-melted vanilla ice cream covered by some nuts and intersecting black lines of hot fudge that literally looked like a spiderweb overlaying a frosty mountain. But the creamy ice cream was cold and also refreshing, with bits of scattered hot fudge that just kept on giving as the gooey lines of sweet goodness broke down in the bowl. 

This time an extra star was earned, because the same cheerful service was also efficient, and the kitchen was much quicker in churning out food. I just didn't like my server removing a fork from the salad bowl and placing it on the wood tabletop for reuse.",2011-08-02 03:36:45

Of note, our favorite item both times being the negitoro hand roll. This time we ordered one omakase ($80) and one nigiri tasting ($48). The main differences between the omakase and nigiri tasting are 6 pieces of sashimi, 3 pieces of grilled fish, and miso soup. Was it worth the extra $32? Certainly not. The main problem during this visit was that the serving sizes were significantly smaller than last time, ranging from 1/3 to 1/2 smaller. The first time we had 2 nigiri tastings because that was all they were offering at the time. While we weren't stuffed, our hunger was comfortably satiated. This time around we paid for more food, but both left hungry. In fact, as we left, I seriously considered stopping by Ramen Sora! The quality overall is still excellent, except for the surprisingly subpar miso soup, but they have gotten stingy with their portion sizes. Previously, while not an inexpensive night out, the price could be considered reasonable. Sadly this is no longer the case. We are not big eaters and when we pay $128, before tax/tip, for two tasting menus, we expect to at least not be still hungry at the end. We don't mind shelling out top dollar for great food, but it is difficult to justify paying these prices for what have become miniscule portions of food.

The mashed potatoes with gravy was okay. The chili my son had some robust flavors working to is favor. Our favorite item was the sauteed mushrooms. Yum! I could've enjoyed two servings. The sad dish was served to our guest of honor: smothered chicken. They did not serve it with the cheese or the sauce. We returned it, and it looked like it was microwaved.

A look at the menu shows that the owner keeps things simple. There are usually about 5 or 6 different styles of hot dog (also available in turkey or soy). Here's some of them that I've tried:

-Chicago (mustard, sweet relish, onion, tomatoes, kosher pickle, & sport peppers) - A more basic approach to the standard hot dog that I'm accustomed to. Tasted great. Plus, got it for $2 for reading a Twitter deal from the owner.
-Milwaukee Brat - Spicy brown mustard, caramelized onion, saurkraut. Solid brat. Carmelized onions were a nice touch. I didn't think it was anything to write home about, but still good nonetheless.
-Chilean (mustard, spicy mayo, avocado, tomatoes & sauerkraut) - Another one of my favorites. The spicy mayo kick and fresh avocado slices make this one shine.
-Soñoran (mustard, mayo, bacon, bbq beans, tomato, onion, queso fresco, and salsa verde on bolillo roll)- This thing is a monster. Plus, it has bacon in it. Can't go wrong with bacon. Probably my favorite item. But man, it has a lot going on in it. I could only make it a once in a while thing to eat this.


The owner puts on a one-man show here. Orders take a few minutes, a tad bit longer if you roll with a turkey dog. This is something I don't mind, since something so delicious shouldn't come instantly.

The prices are good, the food is awesome, and you can tell that the owner loves what he does. It's because of this that I've prescribed myself at least 1 Chilean a week.",2010-12-03 19:51:13

I was SO thrilled that Streetcar Po-Boys opened in a new location.
I had such a great visit at the old spot, and never had the chance to take my fella to enjoy their food.

We stopped by today, just a day after they opened for business!

I love the new location: much nicer neighborhood, much cleaner, bright...really good location.

Service was great.  There was one tiny mixup with the order, but to make up for it, they brought us out some beignets for dessert...I'll get to that in a minute.

We ordered the Streetcar, which is fried catfish, fried shrimp, and fried oysters.  We got it dressed with lettuce, tomato, and half mayo (fella isn't a fan.).  We also ordered the Cajun fried mac n cheese, and the fried okra. 

After a few minutes, our server brought over a sandwich that looked great, but wasn't ours, it was a roast beef with gravy.  She apologized profusely, and when she brought our actual order over, she let us know that due to the mix up and the wait, they'd be giving us some complimentary beignets.  That was very sweet, and not necessary.  

The Streetcar was delicious.  Fried catfish, full of flavor.  Oysters that weren't dripping in grease, and perfect shrimp.  The bread is to die for.  

The Cajun Mac n Cheese was a HUGE hit...perfectly battered, hot and creamy on the inside...I'm thinking now that I should have taken a picture of the inside, it was so unbelievably cheesy. 

The fried okra was nothing less than perfection.  

This was the first time I'd ever had beignets, and let me tell you, these are WONDERFUL.  Crunchy on the outside, doughy and sweet on the inside, covered in powdered sugar... (*Pro-tip: When sharing these with someone you love, think of Echo and the Bunnymen's song ""Lips Like Sugar"" and share a sugar kiss.  Trust me.)

The owner stopped over to chat with us, like she had at the old location, which I think is a great personal touch.  She truly loves what she does, and seems to delight in making people happy with great food.

There will probably be a few growing pains while they settle in to their new place, but be patient.  The food is delicious, and 100% worth any minor snags or delays.  

Great job, Streetcar, and welcome back!!!",2015-06-24 03:07:31

They held a Customer Appreciation day this weekend (last weekend of June) where they were giving away pizzas for just showing them a downloaded coupon they had on Facebook. Perfect opportunity to give them a try. 
We went later in the day, around 6:30, there were other patrons there getting pizzas, but they were not as busy as I thought. They had a wheel to spin for prizes, but you had to fill out a form for their email notifications. 
So the pizza smelled good, it looked pretty average. The free pizza was a medium but seemed small. I was shocked at the price they charge for this size pizza with pepperoni... $14.50, that's outrageous! 
On to the taste, it was very basic, bland dough, cheese, spicy greasy pepperoni, if it didn't have pepperoni on it, it would've been tasteless. I would compare it to a grocery store frozen pizza.

Have you ever done something one day and was more upset the next day about what you did? Well that's how I feel about dropping $45 on Pomegranate cafe for a late veggie lunch - solo. (I can imagine the heads shaking from all the carnivores. That's steak money, right?) 

Yeah, I feel ya'. My support for veggie eateries is quickly waning. They are over-priced and can be quite pretentious with the creativity.

So, I was down south on a hot afternoon and really worked up a sweat. I remembered reading that Pomegranate Cafe sold fresh juice and was located somewhere near 40th St and Chandler Blvd. Had I known to look for the shopping center with Safeway and two doors down from Trader Joes....Landmarks, folks! Very important when giving directions.... 

PC's white and pink sign is a tad dull against the building. If I wasn't specifically looking for the cafe, I probably would have missed it and gone somewhere else to eat. But anyway, I walked in, grabbed all the menus (regular, HH, and juice bar), and had a seat. (Only order at the counter if you want take-away). 

Asked for a juice right away and despite the ""slow service"" comments that other reviewers have posted, I wasn't too bothered by the several minutes it took for juice to make its way to my table. I pushed aside water and guzzled it down. Aahhh. I could feel, see, hear, smell, sense, taste, perceive the essence of life coursing through my veins. That must be the feeling Popeye gets  after eating spinach (mmmm, love those greens).

Why only three stars for PC?
One for just being veggie +
One for being freshly made +
One for serving fresh juice 

Fresh juice was the best part of my afternoon. I wasn't too impressed with the food. I ordered off the regular menu like an idiot and hit myself later for not giving the happy hour menu a chance. Could've saved myself half the price. 

Truth be told - I should've stopped with the juice, paid the bill, and walked away. But, ooh, I spied with my little eye jackfruit tacos and jackfruit sliders. 

- BBQ jackfruit sliders (3) for $12: jackfruit, peppers, onions, jalapeno cabbage slaw, chimichurri on bun. 
Even though I asked for the BBQ sauce on the side, the jackfruit itself had a sickly sweetness that cancelled my enjoyment. What I really liked, though, were the silver dollar-sized buns. 

- Jamaican jerk street tacos (3) for $12: jerk seasoned jackfruit, cabbage slaw, pico, baja sauce, chimichurri on corn tortillas. 
Did that say jamaican? Show me the jerk who thought of that because wurnt no part of those tacos Jamaican. Spicy? Nope. All I could taste was that sickly sweet jackfruit. Created and tasted exactly like the sliders.  

The jackfruit wasn't prepared the way I'm used to having it. In fact I couldn't even tell that it was jackfruit by sight because it was mixed with other stuff and only one spoonful of it was buried under the mounds of cabbage slaw and sauce.

When I mentioned the sweetness to the two staff members who checked on me they blamed the jackfruit. Really? I know what jackfruit tastes like. Even when fresh it's not overly sweet. Either this jackfruit was sweetened and then packaged, or one of PC's sauces used in the dishes was too sweet. Won't order it again. 

- For dezzert, a slice of tropical cake. Good cake, real cake, but could have used more tropics and less sugary lemon frosting. AGAIN with the sweetness.

Overall, PC's dishes are very colourful and look beautiful. I'll try a wrap and/or salad next time, but I won't go out of my way to eat there again any time soon.  Four items averaged to about $10 apiece, then tax and probably a surcharge for a take out box.

After the wings, I got a tofu dish with rice. Again, while the flavors and spices were tasty, the tofu wasn't cooked well at all. I know it's difficult to cook tofu well, but come on guys, you advertise yourselves as a vegetarian/friendly restaurant! More so, all of the food was sooooooo overpriced! The seitan wings to start were $10 for 10 wings. Next, the tofu dish was around 12 bucks. I think they jacked up the prices because they know most people are going there with Groupons.

Tan Lac is situated near some other Asiatic cuisine houses, including the Green Pepper, which I am due to try out soon.

The pho arrives! Horns sound, peasants rejoice, banners of epicurean celebration abound! The broth is delicious and savory.

The bill came & you guessed it, she charged me for it and when I asked her to take it off the bill, she deducted the amount of the wine (not including tax) and wrote on the bill in pen. OMG, I was so angry and the whole experience embarrassed me in front of my friends. 

The bar was filled with lonely guys lined up at the bar drinking. I should have guessed. 

I'm so angry, I'm not even going to review the shitty food, it's not worth my time.",2013-02-02 03:57:09

GkXgNGOFSofZreyaVztqVQ,fcfFXPoxpLHvR98cvf618A,9Jn6MJZMz2R6rcszqmXDqg,2,5,1,0,"What shocks me most about Luci is not that it gets generally high marks from various online sites but that the fairly tough Toronto Star gave it a *** review only a couple of years ago. Amy Pataki is a very solid restaurant critic and three stars from her usually means that the place is money. But in this case I have to fairly strongly disagree with her pretty much across the board. Also please note that although I'm only posting my Yelp! review now, I actually ate there in February of 2012, the same time hers was published. So although it has been a couple of years, I really have no inclination to go back and give it a second chance. 

The initial impressions walking in were quite positive, a decor that said upscale but not stuffy. My party was greeted warmly, promptly seated and offered water. Off to a good start. Sadly, the same level of service did not continue throughout the meal. While certainly polite, it would be a stretch to call our service attentive. Please note that it wasn't especially busy, simply a typical Saturday night. We were asked if we wanted wine (which of course we did), though only once. Our glasses were refilled but we were never asked if we wanted a second bottle...I can't remember the last time that's happened to me, especially for a party of four. We certainly would have sprung for it had they asked but they didn't bother so neither did we. Also there really was no ""how is everything"", other than perhaps once after our appetizers arrived and there certainly should have been considering how the food turned out.

Two of us ordered the Caesar Salad ($9.50) and it was an embarrassment. The salad itself was very small, which would have been fine had it not been so lacking in every way. The flavour was nonexistent, to the point where they actually included small bowls of extra salad dressing on the side for some reason, as if to say ""we know this may be bland, so feel free to add more dressing"". I've never come across that. Not to mention the fact that both plates had perhaps two croutons each and three very small strips of shaved parmesan. But the worst part? The salads were wet and it doesn't seem as though they had bothered to dry the lettuce at all.

The Insalata di Rape Rose ($8.50) was much better flavour wise, but correct me if I'm wrong: doesn't that translate into ""Beet Salad""? Well, much like the parmesan on the Caesar, the amount of actual beets on the plate was miniscule. The crab cakes ($12.00) were good, but again a major problem: there was a fairly sizable shell found inside. Choking or chipping a tooth is not something one expects while eating crab cake. 

As for the mains, the problems continued. The Spaghetti Dal Mare ($22.00) tasted a little like chow mein. A filet mignon ($28.00) which was ordered medium-well was quite clearly well-done. Not impressed. And the mashed potatoes that accompanied it were absolutely stone cold when they arrived. This was the one complaint we did actually voice at the time and at least they were replaced with ones that were actually hot, if somewhat pedestrian. Happily for me the dish I ordered, the Fettuccini di Nonna ($15.00), was delicious, a lovely blend of goat cheese, eggplant, tomato sauce and mint. It was the only real winner of the evening, so far as I was concerned. 

The Crème Brulee ($9.00) was very tasty to be sure, but not for what you're paying. For example North 44's Crème Brulee is four dollars more but I'd have paid double. With it, you're in desert paradise. Luci's was just trip to Orlando by comparison.

Luci may not be a terrible place but it's also not three out of four. Not even remotely close. There were positives but there was also A LOT wrong here. If I could describe Luci Restaurant in one word it would probably be ""careless"". Wet lettuce, indifferent service, cold potatoes, overcooked steak and a stray crab shell? Simply put, it's not worth it. There's no shortage of similar places in the area and unless I'm getting a free meal, I'm going to try one of them instead.",2014-04-03 16:36:30

If this is indeed the case, then I would go see a cardiologist asap. While Aria the hotel is in fact a very nice hotel, it does fall short in many aspects. Here are a few of my tips if you choose to call Aria home for your next Vegas vacation. 

If you are staying at Aria, do yourself a favor and valet your car.... the walk from the Self Park to the lobby is quite a hike. It involves you having to transverse the ENTIRE casino floor. 

The deluxe rooms are a tad bit on the small side for new vegas hotel standards. That's not to say they are not nice! In fact, the technology in the room is super cool with touch screen controls that can do almost anything from opening and closing the curtains to adjusting the room temperature. The bed is also very comfortable. 

DONT EAT at the BUFFET! you have been warned. 

The casino is a tad bit on the dark side.... either bring a flash light or go gamble next door at the Bellagio. 

and MOST IMPORTANTLY... dont believe all the hype! this isnt the reinvention of the Las Vegas hotel, ""remember to breath,"" ""words won't fail you"" and you just might come out liking this place!",2010-03-16 05:13:45

We were seated quickly, as the place wasn't packed, but busy. The table/seats were rather small and  uncomfortable, I had no where to put my bag. Service was fairly quick - this place is Korean-run so they had those service buttons that authentic Japanese restaurants may not have. 

I ordered the Chirashi (around $15) and my friend ordered the chicken terriyaki and salmon bento box. His dish arrived way earlier than mine, and there was a piece of sushi missing from his Bento box. We advised the waitress and she apologized and said ""I didn't eat it!"" .. and brought back two more pieces of sushi for him. The amount of rice in the Bento box is less than a fistful - the portions were very small. My chirashi looked really nice when it finally arrived. The rice was a good portion, but the only sashimi that seemed fresh and not defrosted was the salmon. The tuna was very rough and I felt like I was chewing beef tendons. The rice is very vinegary and went well with the salmon. Overall, our meal was really meh.

A little lunch, a little solving of the worlds problems (without benefit of alcohol, this time:) even a discussion of the the galactic issues that confront us all (did you know that there is an excellent chance that the Milky Way Galaxy...our home...will collide with another galaxy (Andromeda), soon?!?!?

I will tell you what it is...it is really good!

Let me just state that FOR A CAR DEALERSHIP and for having numerous car buying experiences, my most recent trip to Desert Nissan was made the most tolerable car-buying experience to date. (Thanks to Salesman, Daniel and Louise, the financing goo-ru).

Those of you who have been through the car buying experience know that you pretty much set up camp for the day at the dealership, doesn't matter what dealership it is, you're there for the ladder part of the day. 

So my date with Desert Nissan commenced at 10AM and wrapped up around 4PM but the final outcome was me driving off in a car I was absolutely in love with and in a payment I was 100% comfortable with. 

Daniel was funny, up front (from the East Coast so I could relate to his direct approach), and went the extra mile to make sure I was happy and comfortable with my decision (either way).

I felt the duche-bag vibe on a few other car dealers standing around so it definitely makes a difference in who you are working with. But if you are in the market for a new/er vehicle soon, I would recommend at least checkin in with Daniel and his staff.

Stringy in a bad way like maybe it was microwaved and then cooled off.  They do things the hard way and serve soft drinks in small cups, but I will say they were never empty.  The wait staff was all over that.  

But their cheese crisp is 10 stars!  Just the right balance of crispiness, yet still foldable.  And their hot sauce was pretty good, too!  I'm sure I will be back for that!",2014-07-17 17:25:36

Lets talk about customer service for a minute.. more specifically how there is no absolute definition but rather that it is often seen as an activity, performance measurement and a philosophy. That is why, generally speaking, one single customer service definition does not exist.. Here are some definitions of customer service in use today:

""Customer service is the ability to provide a service or product in the way that it has been promised""

""Customer service is about treating others as you would like to be treated yourself""

""Customer service is an organization's ability to supply their customers' wants and needs""

""Customer Service is a phrase that is used to describe the process of taking care of our customers in a positive manner""

""Customer Service is any contact between a customer and a company, that causes a negative or positive perception by a customer""

""Customer service is a process for providing competitive advantage and adding benefits in order to maximize the total value to the customer""

""Customer Service is the commitment to providing value added services to external and internal customers, including attitude knowledge, technical support and quality of service in a timely manner""

""Customer service is a proactive attitude that can be summed up as: I care and I can do.""

Okay, now can someone tell me who hired the m-f-ers that are supposed to be customer service agents here because Cox is sucking major ass with this, and for the record, I am currently unemployed and I know for a goddamn fact that I could easily do their jobs a million times better even if all I had to work with was Braille. It is not hard. You deal with cable television. DVR's. Phones. Internet.. seriously.. this shit has been around for years and it is not difficult to maintain... get your shit together Cox, and don't give me the run around by transferring me to 17 different assholes that essentially all transfer me back to a bitchy robot that ""didnt understand what I said"".. all I ask is that I have functioning internet, and when I call you to tell you that my connection is wak, fix it. What the hell else am I paying you for?

I've only been here for lunch and while I do get that they have to prepare for the buffet style eating of the lunch crowd, I'm still going to judge the food for what it was...""Buffet food.""

The naan was nothing special and I can typically tell if I'm going to like an Indian place based on the naan alone.  What I love:  Pillowy, soft, chewy naan.  What I received: flat bread.

The rest of the food:

The chicken tikka masala (which I've been told isn't really an Indian dish...but who cares...it tastes good) was what I expected to be in a buffet tray.  It was okay...but I'm not exactly directing people here to get it.

The Aloo Gobi type dish however, was pretty tasty.  Great job Persis!

The rest of the dishes were good.  I would prefer trying this place again without the buffet style eating.

You can get all the rides done in less than 3 hours. Water is usually chilly but refreshing with the 110 heat.

Parking is included in the gold pass. Take my advice and get there early enough to park in the front. By 12 you have to go the the parking lot found behind the park which is a hassle to get too. As a tip to the owners, please put a gate to get into the park at the back so that pass holders can just get in their. Otherwise it's a hassle.

 I loved that I got a guest pass once a month to take a friend with.

The eatery snack bar or whatever you want to call it was always a pain. Twice I had to wait over an hour to get my food. Paid up front but then waited in a long ass line to receive it. Not cool when you have a three year old screaming they're hungry. Somehow they've got to find a better way to serve their hungry patrons.

You can bring in bottled water but nothing else. They check your stuff at the front and unwrap your towels. 

It was nice that they measure your child at the front and give them a wrist band so that your not being measured at every ride. 

My favorite was the belly racers. That was a blast and so was the wave pool. The kiddy area has warm water and lots to do, keeping them preoccupied. 

I was not a fan of the lazy river. There were never enough rafts and I found myself always waiting 10-15 minutes for a raft for my daughter. 

Overall I will continue to get a pass because its affordable, my child loves it but def not my favorite. They need to expand and have way more rides.",2015-09-13 03:36:38

I hate when all the employees talk a different language in front of you. It's so disrespectful. 
My apt was at 6pm for a pedi. I choose the most expensive one ($50) since I had just spent a week at the lake, and really needed some scrubbing/hydration on my feet. 
It started out great, but ended sooner then expected. I feel she rushed on the leg massage, and the hot stones could have been hotter. Maybe that's just a safety precaution, but I've definitely had hotter stones else where. I guess with an apt 1 hour before close, they do have to rush a little. My feet are in much better condition, but I would like them to be a little bit smoother. Maybe a second apt will do the trick.

Here's what is more awkward: having those waiters hovering over your table, waiting for their orders from the cafeteria (or was it a kitchen?), talking about clubs, their nights, conquests and misc. other adventures.

Appetizers:  Very good.  Let's say B+.  Stuffed peppers.  Best part of the meal.

Entrees:  This was where it just got bad.  Two terrible entrees.  Mezza Chicken Limone tasted like I was eating straight egg.  Zero flavor unless you ate a moutful of salt and capers.

No surprises, good or bad. A serviceable place that I will confuse with others just like it going forward.

I spent three nights here, sharing a room with a friend who booked well in advance, taking advantage of the conference rate, which was around $160 American dollars a night. This didn't seem particularly cheap to me, but it was much cheaper than the going rate when I looked into booking an extra night a month before my trip. I guess this Sheraton is kind of expensive for some reason.

The best thing about this hotel was the location, which was smack in the middle of Toronto's Financial District, a short walk to dozens of bars and restaurants, and a slightly longer walk to other cool little neighborhoods. This was my first visit to Toronto, so I definitely appreciated that. It was also accessible through the network of underground walkways, which came in handy when I needed to carry luggage on a rainy day.

The room was fine, clean and comfortable and generic. Housekeeping did a nice job. The conference area was standard levels of dreary and usable, a couple floors of big rooms below ground. The lobby was nice enough, and I ended up spending a lot of time there, mostly because the bar was kind of terrible, so everyone congregated with drinks in the lobby instead.

One thing of note, I suppose. I was relaxing in my room for a bit before a meeting when the fire alarm went off. It was the most polite, uninsistent fire alarm I've ever heard--I thought at first that it was the doorbell. I walked downstairs from the twelfth floor just in case something was up, and the alarm eventually stopped without any real insight as to what had made it go off in the first place.

Anyway, I had a fine stay at this Sheraton and would recommend it if you're also going to a conference in this Sheraton. It's otherwise a whatever business hotel that costs more than it should, where you might sleep right through a fire alarm.",2017-10-26 17:39:36

It was so good that I wanted to eat it all, tried hard, but just could not finish the mammoth portion, but really, really wanted to do it.

Parking is Hell.  There is private parking in front, but not enough.  Cars are abandoned all over the businesses on both sides and along the road.  And you could get boxed in by some inattentive parker.  Just no room to expand and I don't think that they want to build a multi story parking garage.

Another occasion I had a cup of bean and sausage soup.  It was outstanding and I regretted not ordering a bowl with my gargantuan breakfast.  When I checked out I told the cashier/manager about how yummy the soup was and he asked to kitchen for a takeout of the soup for me...gratis.

If this restaurant wasn't called Magic Noodle, I would've given this place 4 stars. If it was called something in reference to the various snacks they have, it would have been an easy 4 stars, cause honestly I enjoyed the snacks more than the noodles themselves.

This restaurant is 24 hours, which is quite shocking considering there's no wifi...and the place wasn't insanely busy when I left at around 9:30pm. It also doesn't immediately ring ""24 hours"" considering the not-so bar-like atmosphere (no alcohol!).

We had both kinds of noodles, and also ordered the beef pancake, beef skewers, and squid skewers (whole and tentacle). My parents preferred the hand pulled noodle over the sliced noodle, however I preferred the sliced noodle a bit more...personal preference I guess. However I really didn't find the hand pulled noodle that good, cause it was too...soggy. The seafood that came with it felt like it came from the packages you get at T&T, not to mention the imitation crab was undercooked.

The skewers, on the other hand, were excellent!!! I loved the sauce that came with both the squid skewers. The beef skewers were also just as good, and quite honestly I would rather have these skewers anytime over waiting in line at Night It Up, which happened on the same weekend I tried this place.

Service was excellent and we were attended to the entire time we were there. Even the chef who was making the noodles said thank you when we were leaving, so we left him a tip as we left. Overall I would come here for the skewers and snacks, not so much the noodles.",2014-07-15 02:33:51

I have always been a BIG fan of Mimi's but this latest visit for a late breakfast on a Sunday morning was the most disappointing visit ever.  After almost a 20 minute wait we were finally seated even though the restaurant did not appear to be full.  The young girls who were taking names and seating customers didn't seem to know what they were doing.  Despite giving us one of those ridiculous vibrating devices with flashing red lights, they came outside at least twice looking for someone they could not find.  

The biggest disappointment was the cost of our breakfast dishes for what we received.  We each ordered a mimosa with a low end sparkling wine which cost almost $8 each.  My wife ordered their bacon apple waffles which were very good and tasty but there were only 3 tiny waffles about the diameter of a tennis ball . . . completely bare and accompanied by the tiny cup of syrup with chopped apples and bacon bits.  I have a French variation of eggs Benedict which was also pretty tasty but pricey for two small poached eggs on some seasoned mashed potatoes and spinach.

Our server was efficient but somewhat intense and not very personable.  Even the carpet in the dining area appeared dirty and unkempt.  Just not a great experience.  Probably won't return to ANY Mimi's for some time because they have definitely lost their edge and reputation as an upscale value chain restaurant.

Although I am a budding senior citizen (my wife is NOT) I'm beginning to feel out of place at Mimi's which is often populated by a sea of white hairs and snow birds who don't seem to mind their mediocre, high priced fare set in a sort of Disneyesque French atmosphere.

I went here for lunch today not recalling that 50% of their menu is not available 100% of the time and that kind of bummed me out because that means no pizza until 4 pm during the week unless it is Friday or Saturday and no burgers unless it is Friday or Saturday.  Either way, 11:15 am on Wednesday means I have a full choice of sandwiches, pastries, salads, and breakfast choices.  Many will say that those choices should be more than enough to choose from if I am willingly going to dine here.  Well...it wasn't my day to pick the lunch spot.  A work colleague actually picked it which is amusing due to my second gripe: between the loud music, gabbing hikers, lunching ladies on their way to or from the Biltmore or Fashion Square, the place doesn't necessarily lend itself to normal conversation.  That is assuming there is a place for everyone to sit. Just because you are alone, with your latte and laptop doesn't mean that you need to take up an entire 4 top to yourself.  The place itself and the atmosphere just doesn't feel as ""phoenix"" as I recall when I first went. Something has changed. I feel like all of the LA transplants come here to recharge and then go off again to do their thing. It only made me laugh harder when I was leaving the restaurant and noticed the sign on the door that read ""LGO now open in Santa Monica."" Yahtzee! That is exactly where I thought I was anyways during lunch so I guess it makes sense that they opened another one out there.  I also think that the flow can be improved from finding parking, to the ordering, to the waiting at the end of the counter for your food, to finding a seat.  I would think for all the hassle I was going to get served a plate of food that was made from the water of the fountain of youth or at least a hint at the secret of life.  But alas my $8.00 tuna salad sandwich only came with a couple of pickles and a watermelon wedge.

While I will say one of the redeeming is the food (although an $8.00 sandwich has to be pretty damn fantastic to be $8.00). My tuna salad on 9 grain was fresh, not too much mayo or other junk in it.. It is served with tomato, cucumber, apple and greens. I will be honest, the tuna is stacked high, but the bread is overly toasted and I hardly tasted the apple. But I repeat, the tuna salad itself was pretty good.

I know when I first tried La Grande I liked it a lot. I thought the breakfast was great and I truly enjoyed the scene there. These days it just seems like it has lost a bit of it's luster for me. I am sure I will be back in the future and will give it another chance. It will probably be when I can get dropped off, have called in my order ahead of time and it is between the hours of 4 and 5 pm on a Friday so I can freely order from the entire menu.",2009-08-12 21:45:36
6PbjrdfxSlyIz-kS0Jzi8A,BOQ_p0wtX8Xl9k2R9FBiBg,J9u2Ef5v_wMjo_VbvXbEwA,4,39,11,20,"If you have stumbled across this review debating if a House Seats membership is worth it, here is my take (as a current two-year member):

House Seats has allowed me to watch up to thirty shows since I moved to Las Vegas two years ago. Their one-year membership for two-seat reservations (they offer two or four seat options) is $80 a year. Let's say the average cost of a single ticket to a show in Vegas is $50 - meaning that after reserving two tickets for one show on House Seats, you already break even with the membership price!

I've scored some really awesome shows and concerts through House Seats. A lot that I wouldn't even think of attending or paying for, but when it's ""free"", why not?? That being said, these events turn out to be some of the best, most enjoyable entertainment uncovered in Vegas. Truly cannot put a price on that. 

House Seats undoubtedly has really solid connections. Everything from concerts, cirque, comedy, magic, even large events in DTLV, Thomas & Mack, and the T Mobile Arena. So many times I've been seated in the front row or VIP section of events. I curiously look up ticket prices post-show and am just wow'd to have scored free tickets to $100 seats!

**HOWEVER, scoring tickets to GOOD shows takes a bit of effort. You can't always expect to log onto the site and have a big show readily available for you. They have 20-30 reoccurring smaller shows always posted, and 3-10 bigger events will come by every week. They have a tab for ""Shows You've Missed"" so you can cry about what you slipped on.

There is no technique, pattern, or certain time of the day that big shows are posted. Just like all things in Vegas, you simply have to get lucky.

So ultimately, would I recommend House Seats? If you are a Vegas local who likes to try new things, or often has blank moments where you want to do something but don't know what (and want to do more than just ""go on the strip""), I would definitely sign up for a membership. Just pop on the site and pick a show roulette-style for a spontaneous date night. The membership is handy as a last-resort option on things to do.

I knocked off one star for their almost non-existent customer service. You are only able to reach House Seats staff through email (no phone number made available) and they are only responsive during particular business hours. So if you have a prompt question or concern on the weekend, you'd have to wait until they are open on the weekday for an answer. Yet even on business days, they are not very prompt, and have even responded in a short/unaccommodating way that I found off-putting.... So just avoid having reason to contact them, and you'll be good. Lol.",2017-01-17 23:37:20

Location: The heart of Monkland village.

Bagels: If you're not in the mood to grab breakfast here, then head straight for the back where men sporting white aprons make these awesome bagels on site. You can order, plain, sesame, poppy seed, all dressed, cinnamon & raisin etc. A dozen will run you $7.50 (the 'specialty types like cinnamon & raisin go for $9.60) and if you stop in at the right time, you'll be getting those bagels fresh out of the wood-burning oven. HELLO! The guys even cater to my OCD need for 'light' bagels and handpick them for me when prepping my dozen. Love it.

Eating: I usually go for breakfast and it's pretty decent. The portions are pretty good for the money and I've never left there feeling hungry. Of course, every plate comes with your choice of bagel - like you had to ask! they offer a great variety of eats that will satisfy everyone. If you go on a weekend, plan to go early or expect to wait for a table. It's a pretty popular breakfast place. 

Service: It's OK but I think it depends when you go. I've had great service, but I've also had mediocre service. Regardless, I'll still go just for the bagels!",2014-03-16 16:09:47

You are in Cleveland and pizza is messed up around here. A local guy who wears a camo bandana hangs out here. He once brought in meat balls made out of venison. He let everyone dip their grimy hands into his thermos and feast. He kept offering women his ""deer balls"". The beer selection is top of the line.

1) For dine in.  Had it rare, meat was tough.  Ran out of ketchup twice (should have told the waiter to bring me a bottle instead of just a dinky little sauce cup of it), which was annoying.  Didn't care for the home fries even though waiter says they make it themselves fresh on premises (I prefer In 'N' Out's fresh fries version).
2) Had ordered 1 to go (had to use up the $25 gift card I got from work), waiter recommended that the steak be medium-rare for safety reasons since I was taking it home.  Oddly, the medium-rare steak microwaved in my kitchen and eaten off my coffee table was much better than the rare steak I had at the restaurant.  Also, for the to-go order I opted for fried potatoes instead of fries, and the potatoes (little spuds cut up) were great, especially with my endless supply of ketchup from my fridge.

The Produce and Seafood section is fresh and the quality is good. Another section is dedicated to ramen in various flavors and spice levels with a wide selection of brands. 

We rarely get any issues with customer service but when they get busy the lines can be long but they move in a timely manner. The aisles in the store are reasonably larger than other Asian markets and the store is clean and organized.

2 adults 

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 5 stars
Service - 4 stars

Background - Working on hitting my Diner, Drive-Ins and Dives list.

Atmosphere - I really thought my phone app was taking me to wrong place.  We drive deeper and deeper into a residential neighborhood.  Yep very mixed residential, the business is the back behind a home.  Their neighbor across the street has three horses in the front yard.  Gotta love Nevada!  So how do I describe this place? It is like having a block party in some ones back yard.  Mix match of tables and chairs with picnic tables.

Food
  Drinks - A can of Coke.

  My Meal
    Main Course - I want the tri-tip sandwich but they only serve that on Tuesday and Thursday.  I went with the rib tip dinner as my wife was going to eat two the sides which made for a better deal than the lunch.  So much meat!  It was so good, the smoke in the meat was fabulous 

    Dessert - I ordered an apple cobbler, I was not able to finish it as I too much of my lunch.  It was more a pie thrown into the bowl.  I love me some hot cinnamon apples so I did not care.  My wife shared hers, not by choice, with a bee.  She stopped eating it after that.

Service - So you get into a long line.  They take your order and you get your bill.  Then you pay your bill.  Then you take it to the serving station.  We had to wait for the rib tips as they had none at the serving station.  Then they forgot about us.  I was going to give then 3 stars for that portion but he gave us an extra apple cobbler.  

Future - Awesome BBQ and would love to come back for that!",2015-02-04 02:25:07

Stephanie was my server and she started me off with some hot bread and olive oil/chillies.

I ordered Penne Arrabiatta with sausage.  It was good and had just the right amount of heat (spice).  I've had it before without the sausage and it's good meatless too.  Next time I think I'll add chicken.

Stephanie was friendly and helpful and took good care of me.",2015-04-30 19:35:39

1. Maybe it was what I ordered but I wasn't a huge fan of the bacon pizza.  I got the power lunch for $21 includes soul or salad, a choice of a margarita pizza or bacon pizza, and dessert (salted caramel ice cream or bread pudding). The pizza is pretty good but maybe I am spoiled by my favorite five fifty at Aria.  However the Caesar was really good and so was the bread pudding.  
2. Avocado toast was kind of like a healthy fat version of bruschetta.  Good if you like tomatoes and arugula.  

Service 
1. 5 stars all the way!  So helpful and the hostess was friendly which really sets the whole experience! 
2. I cannot wait to go back and have great service again

Ambiance 
1. Again 5 stars!  I loved all the details and I would say this is where honey salt excels!  Picture say it all: etching on the glasses, on the napkins, bowls, and the Check presenter is a sketch book to leave comments!  I enjoyed my experience

Friday night looking for a place uptown that isn't 'clubby' and offers a nice atmosphere for a pint...go to thought, ""an Irish pub"". Should be low key and on the 'quieter side', right? WRONG! 

This place was half empty at 12:00 on Friday. They had some live music - great love Irish folk music, but unfortunately they were blasting 90's iconoclastic tunes and country. What? You're an Irish Pub? Not only did the music not fit the 'vibe', but it was way too loud. Who are you singing to that loudly? The place is empty, turn it down. 

Asked a waiter where everyone was and he said there was a DJ/nightclub area upstairs. Great, thanks for not putting it in the pub area itself...the country music was bad enough, but again confusion. If I wanted loud country music I would have went to one of the many rowdy country bars in the city. 

The bartender was also not friendly. Attempted to make conversation and he pretty much blew me off. My friend asked to start a tab, bartender then brought the check which later caused a bit of a hassle when he tried to order a second drink. 

Ri Ra's was great before the fire, but now it is defiantly on my list of places not to go whilst uptown. Maybe the afterwork scene is a bit different, but late night was atrocious.",2017-10-07 14:37:14

It's pretty cheap too but if you're eating with one other person it's about $20 which about the same as sweet tomatoes for 2 people so I'd say the better deal would be to go to sweet tomatoes but I mean if you want fast but healthy food id definitely come here though!
My favorite soups from here would have to be tomato basil or veggie quinoa and the best salad would have to be chicken chipotle or the healthiest is the kale salad. Best fruit one is the nuts about berries 

They also have really good house made drinks like the cucumber/basil infused water is my favorite.
I also love how they give you a strawberry and bread with every order. 
The service is very fast and they have a lot of good workers working for them. 
The interior is decorated nicely too.
The only problems I have is that the portions are so little. Like when they scoop you your soup they do one scoop and it fills only half the bowl. 
One time I was ordering and the worker gave me a little too much soup and the manager told them to take some out because it was too much? 
Other than that though everything else is fine. Sometimes it's too cold in here too, but other than that I'd still come back and bring my friends if we want quick healthy food",2016-05-08 06:31:38

Who am I to turn down a free burrito?  I hadn't been to a Chipotle in years, anyways.  After today's visit, I was reminded why.  Chipotle just isn't that good!  Their salads are good for a low carb option, but everything else there has never ever impressed me.  You will see why, below........

I drove down, parked, and walked in the place.  I was greeted immediately and that was about the only good thing I could say.  As soon as I walked in the door, some young employee (douchebag looking ""bro"") that was on the fryer cooking some chips let out a huge belch.  You could hear the thing echo throughout the restaurant.  How unprofessional is that? I mean, come on dude...you are working, and acting like you are at the frat house with your bros.  If I was a manager on duty, I definitely would have said something to him.  Anyways........... After that nice ""welcoming belch"", I ordered my burrito.  The first guy who got my tortilla ready was like a robot. Instead of asking a question, he just kind of shouted,  ""White or brown, black or pinto"".  I knew what he meant (what kind of rice and beans), but if this was your first time at Chipotle, you wouldn't have any idea of what the fuck he was talking about.  Anyways....I went with a steak burrito, white rice, no beans.  Down the line, I added hot sauce, cheese, sour cream and guacamole.  My burrito was wrapped up (piss poor, might I add), I had the lady scan my coupon, purchased a drink for $2.00 and sat down to eat.  Here is how it was..........

Steak Burrito-  Like I said earlier, this burrito was wrapped horribly!  There was salsa leaking out the bottom, sour cream smeared on the side, and it almost completely fell apart when I first picked it up.  I soon realized that there was no way I could eat this burrito with my hands.  I basically cut that shit up with my fork and ate it that way.  On to the ingredients........... The steak was whack!  It had a rubbery texture to it and was tough to chew.  The hot sauce tasted ok.  The sour cream was overkill and the cheese kind of got lost in it.  The only good thing in that burrito was the guacamole.  I will give Chipotle that...they make a decent guacamole.  The tortilla was crappy, too!  I ate the whole thing because I don't like to waste food, but about 1/4 of the way through it, I was over it.  It I had paid for it, I would have been pissed!  

Honestly, I don't know if I am ever coming back to any Chipotle.  I know for damn sure I wont be coming back to this one!  It takes a lot for me to bitch about free food, but I am bitching right now!  Totally disappointed in today's visit!",2016-02-25 06:19:21

Ok, so Madhouse has a great vibe from the art work on the wall to the friendly and colorful people who work there. When I first started going, I'd go through their drive thru and R2D2 would great me! Being a STAR WARS geek, that was THE BEST THING EVER!!! I'm not gonna lie, that may have been the main reason I kept returning. But seriously, their coffee is scrumptious. I've tried their red velvet, their mad max, their white mocha, mad cow and cake batter. All good, but I am a repeat offender of their mad max. It has blended coffee beans in it so its got more texture than your usual blended drinks. Like I said, all drinks are good.

We got seated upstairs and yes, the floor is really slippery. Have someone to hold onto and be careful going up and down the stairs too. 

The upstairs was awesome! I wanna sit here every time. It had its own bar and waitstaff. Our waiter and waitress were awesome! They were so attentive and even with our large group they were patient and got everything right.

We got the margaritas, crab nachos and taquitos. Even splitting it, it was too much food and we were very hungry when we got there. The portions were overwhelming and since the food was heavy, we got full quickly. 

They had some wonderful desserts on the menu but we didn't get to try them, next time for sure.

A few notes, there is valet service or you can park in the Epicentre garage. Valet is 15/20? and Parking is 10bucks typically. You can also take the light rail, the stop is right behind the restaurant. Get the back bean plantain mash, I didn't get it but I tried my brother's and it was good.",2012-02-05 16:45:48

Me and a few co workers went here for a work dinner Sunday night. We got there around 730 pm and there was no wait at all. As we entered, it looked like a cross between a marina and a huge warehouse. The decor was definitely done by a minimalist, but it worked. Everything is very similar to hot n juicy. 

Food: They have different sauces/ spice levels, corn, steamed rice, gumbo, fried shrimp, cajun fries, & chicken. The sauce of course can be put on shrimp, crab, or crawfish. Everything was yummy and oh so spicy. Beware of the spice. Everything is like one spice level higher than what it is rated, so order a level down. Our table ordered shrimp medium in the whole shabang sauce and fried shrimp with mild cajun fries. The fries were to die for as well as the fried shrimp. The boiled shrimp was okay. It just lacked that umph that hot n juicy has. Still tasty though. A few tidbits though: they charge for water refills $1.25 I believe,  condiments are available for a fee, and prepared to be very messy.

The prices: About the same as hot n juicy. About $10/lb for shrimp, some change for corn on the cob, $2 for a bowl of rice, and $8.99 for most of the baskets (chicken tender, wings, fried shrimp).",2012-02-03 20:03:52

Setup is as pictured. Your burrito comes wrapped with egg/meat, cheese, and pico. Pappas/potatoes are actually served on the side, and you have two little cups of salsa.

I liked the overall burrito. Egg being scrambled fresh is always a must, plus the slightly crisp exterior of the tortilla. Not sure if the norm, but they somehow managed to fold my chorizo and egg opposite each other in a yin-yang fold with tortilla, so that was pretty neat.

The potatoes were for oiled and cooked on the flat top. Basically cut like half fries, they were a little oily for me but had a good bite, kind of like a parboil or bake. Both salsas were actually really good - the red one had that spicy bite to it.

I told her it was a cool concept - food, laser tag, bowling and video games.    BUT. The experience could have been MUCH BETTER.  One thing that is bugging me about the visit and interaction with the manager named Joel.


I dropped of one son with his friends for a birthday party, and my younger son and I went to spend time together on our own.  We ended up playing one of those claw games, and he won a ""Baby-g-shock"" watch.  Him and I were super excited!  We opened it up right away because he was excited to put it on, and when we did it was a pretty pink girls watch.  Now, I am not saying boys can't wear pink, but there were other colored watches in the game (the one he went for was In a white case, and watch wasn't visible) and so I asked the manager if we could swap for another color.  He said he would, so we were excited and I thanked him for his help.  We all walked to the game, and that's when he noticed that the other prizes had a plastic wrap, and since I had remove the wrap from our watch, he said there was nothing he could do.  I explained to him the package was white so we thought it was a white watching inside, and we did not realize it was pink until we opened it up.  We had to remove the plastic to open it to see the color.  Still he said there was nothing He could do.  I know it may not seem like a big deal, and I think that's the point.   It wasn't a big deal, it was An easy fix, and those easy fixes can make a significant impact on the customers visit.  It can take the rating From a 4 star to a 2 star, the poor visit can be shared online, shared with family and friends, and can impact the customers decision to return.

The problem is that the food here is pricy and only so-so. It isn't bad, just bland. I have tried both their Filet Mignon & Eggs and the Eggs Benedict. My Filet was overlooked but since I was hungry I ate it anyway without complaining. The eggs Benedict were undercooked with raw egg whites and a very water hollandaise sauce.   Oh well, people don't come to Vegas for breakfast. 

Another good and bad point is that they open at 7:30 am but are not staffed to serve until 8:00 am. So I got to my table and had to wait a while to be served.

We were in the area, though, for a bunch of other stores nearby (Best in the West). (Our main TJ's is the Downtown Summerlin location.)  

We saw two familiar faces from the Decatur/Oakey location. It was pretty busy (a pretty mixed customer base here) by the time we visited in the mid-afternoon. The setup is slightly different than the other TJ's, but this might be the smaller store with the narrowest aisles, or maybe because there were so many shoppers, it got a bit tighter inside; not sure, could of been both. 

Bare with me, we weren't there long, so I am going by memory. The very front had the flowers and herbs in pots, as well as the cut flowers. I do like that the aisles were at an angle, to the right. To the left, front of the store, are the checkout counters. I didn't see the little shopper shopping carts (our boy loves that little cart), so maybe those are not available here. The produce (it's on the floor, as well), cheese, hummus, and some packaged meats- above the salads (sausage), is along the right side of the wall. The aisle nearby was boxed bars and boxed cereals. The middle aisles had the frozen food: main, seafood, rice, burgers, chicken, fish, side dishes, bagged vegetables, bagged fruit, waffles, and various ice cream/dessert goods. Next aisles are canned goods, pasta, sauce, olives, spices, then, the chips, bagged nuts & fruit, health & beauty, paper goods, & pets. Last aisle, to the far left, is the wine and alcohol. Along the left wall, are the coffee, tea, bread, baked goods, and other refrigerator (other packaged meats). Nearby is the bathroom. Middle, back wall had the dairy section. Right side, back wall, had the convenience foods. 

Clean store. There is usually a couple of samples being offered. The station is near the frozen foods aisle. Dependable store with great options for shoppers. We usually get salad & produce, dog food, vitamins, uncrystallized ginger, chips (regular & unsalted), sliced meat- no nitrates, beans, turkey chili, frozen brown rice, frozen roasted corn, mahi burgers, pickled jalapenos, organic pickles, spices, & sourdough bread- these are some of our family staples.",2018-05-09 18:45:31

However my parents wanted to go and we had a holiday meal there.  The place is decorated a little odd (Victorian in the back end, wood paneled basement style in the middle, and a pub up front) but I liked the kitchyness of it all. 

Our server, Miss Suzie, has been there for 46 years (really!) and knew her stuff.  As you could imagine she's not the fastest moving server but made up for it in smiles.

We had some red wine to start, the house cab.  Not bad, have no idea what it was.  They didn't really have a kids' menu so we had to order adult portions and split it.  They brought out the adult meals and plates to split it.  I had hoped that they would have done that in the kitchen, as our tables were not bussed as quickly as we'd have hoped and the plates piled up fast.  Kids all had spag/meatballs and no complaints.  Pricey though.

I had some Italian Wedding soup.  The versions I have all had were orzo pasta, meatballs, spinach (or endive) and broth of some sort.  What I got was chicken and stars soup.  One small meatball.  I asked the server ""Is this wedding soup?  Wheres the greens?"" She replied ""I think they ran out, or maybe they make it that way here.  That's not how I do it at home""...I'd much rather have Miss Suzie's soup b/c the wedding soup at Guarinos was not very good at all.  

I had Chic Parm -- It was good, small portion of pasta (probably a good thing for me) but not $16/plate good.  The price points were high; the dish prob would be a little more in the range of $12-$14.  Sauce was a little sweet but not watery.

When my wife ordered a second glass of wine; the server brought the new glass, picked up the old glass, and poured it into the new one...odd. 

The manager visited our table, and even gave the kids free ice cream.   Nice touch.

Cute little café with indoor and outdoor seating. They update their menu seasonally! I happen to be in the area and caught the happy hour specials. Happy Hour includes food and drinks. 

Happy Hour Portions: Raw Tacos Vivos and Falafel Slider
Both items are one serving each, and a great way to taste their menu. The Tacos Vivos has every taco topping you could possibly think of, it was fantastic. And they don't skimp on the guacamole! The falafel slider is served on their house bread, and it was a little dry for me, but the actual falafel was tasty.  

Entrée: Curried Sweet Potato Quesadilla
This was a seasonal item, and it was far better than I was expecting. The sweet potatoes with the tamarind salsa was a flavorful combination that brought the dish together. They have house hot sauces if you need an extra kick.  

This place is very popular for juices and coffees. I didn't get any but I would return for a fresh smoothie. They have a very extensive brunch menu and I would love to come back to try this. Overall, I would recommend this to a friend.

The Drinks
This is definitely a coffee place. They may offer some tea choices but I don't see it on the menu itself. I highly recommend their Promised Land Latte - it comes with honey and cinnamon and the combination of everything is amazing. I've always had it cold but I'm excited to try it hot when the months finally get colder. The Cardamom Bomb is also pretty good (also only ever had it iced) and it comes with, who would've guessed, cardamom as well as brown sugar. I got their mocha today, hot because it's finally getting colder. It's not too sweet and doesn't have that powdery taste or feeling (like Starbucks tends to do - just don't get mochas at Starbucks...). It's not my favorite of their drinks but it's not too bad. I can't vouch for the black coffees or the grinds because I don't drink coffee like an adult (bring on all the milk and sweetener) but the choice of grinds seems to be extensive so you'll probably find something that'll suit your taste.

They also have various milk options, much more than I've seen at other places, including Hazelnut Milk.

The Price
The drinks seem a bit more expensive than say Starbucks (I figured that was the easier point of comparison that people might be aware of). Not all of the drinks seem to come in various sizes though that may not be the case if you ask. For example, my mocha came as a 12 oz. and was $4.50. A bit more expensive but keep in mind that the quality of the coffee and ingredients are much higher than that of the likes of Starbucks. Furthermore, if you're staying, you don't feel obligated to buy a drink every hour or two. But please feel free to do so because it's that good!

The Food
I will say I've never tried any of their food but they do offer a selection of oatmeal and granola as well as cookies, muffins, and scones.

The Service
I love the baristas here. They're all very friendly and helpful. I had my mocha at the cafe and it came out on a cute wooden tray with a teaspoon (should I need sugar, I didn't because the sweetness was perfect), and a small glass of mineral water. Lovely!

The Atmosphere
I love the atmosphere of this place. The music selection is always nice, a mixture of indie and hip hop (strange mix but it works). The music is definitely audible so if you need a quiet place to study this may not be the place. If you like white noise then it may work for you! There's plenty of seating but without feeling too expansive or too confined. On nicer days they open up their front and the fresh air comes in. It makes people watching easier if you're in the mood. It also looks out to the picnic tables equipped with umbrellas. It's a clean and welcoming environment overall, love it!

The Parking
There's a small lot at the side of the building that houses Rising Star. Otherwise it's all street parking but there appears to be plenty of it so not to worry. This place is near a few other places that you may want to try and is within walking distance of West Side Market and the surrounding area, a great place to walk around on a nice day!",2017-10-12 21:34:22

The food: mediocre at best. A lot of the food was cold to luke warm. Whether it was the lateness of the hour (although we had 2 hours before the buffet closed) or what, I definitely like my food hot. So that disappointed me.

To be honest with you, I prefer thinner pizza, but my roommates insisted on trying Papa Del's one boring Sunday evening. 

We ordered a cheese and sausage which was delivered in about an hour.

The dough is the correct consistency and there was not too much nor too little of it, which is usually an issue at many not-as-well-known deep-dish pizzerias. The cheese tasted great, and there was not 16 tons of it piled on, which can sometimes ruin the pie. Also of good quantity (and quality) was the sauce. It was flavorful and the pizza was not swimming in it, which is all too frequent a problem in the world of crappy deep-dish.

The sausage itself was pretty tasty. I'm not sure if it was fresh or not, we probably should have asked. Back home, fresh toppings are deciding factors for my family, since we can be pizza Nazis. Either way, I just wish there was more of it on the pizza. There was probably only 1-2 little balls per slice, which in my opinion could have been more plentiful.

Ways to improve: 
- a place to wait for your table (when the bar is full) or an alternative option to standing in the doorway such as a callback.
- offer tap water in the initial water up-sell of ""still or sparkling?""
- more sound dampening on ceiling.  At full swing, it's moderately loud.

Things that rocked:
- very friendly, helpful, patient staff.  Server offered to separate bill without us asking and also performing calculations to split shared dishes/wine.
- service of the staff once you're seated are top notch, water refilled constantly, wine glasses refilled promptly
- perfectly cooked black cod.  Layer after layer of succulent cod not in the slightest bit overcooked and yet not raw either.  Cook's in kitchen have PhD's in time/temperature of protein cooking.
- impressive rabbit stew (you get the entire pan, which is plated for you at the table)
- beautifully presented half lobster
- insulated chilled wine sacks for white wine
- impressive port selection
- proper creme brulée (sheet of caramelized sugar you need to crack)
- chocolate fondant cake like a lake of choco-awesomeness

Zuchinni fries too over done and salty. All the food is a bit salty but that doesn't bother me. My boyfriend didn't like it as much. Loaded baked was so good perfectly loaded and cooked!

Sadly, between terrible rush hour traffic in downtown and frigid temperatures, we were a little grumpy when we arrived. However, a beer (well, cider for me) quickly brightened our spirits.

I expected the interior to be a little larger and was surprised to see two separate rooms on two different floors. Most of both floors is taken up by a large bar with several tables in the back of both spaces. The tables are seat yourself, which also surprised me. I'm not sure how that would work on a busy Friday or Saturday night. Our waitress was nice and relatively attentive until the end of our meal, when she apologized for being a bit more hectic (around 7pm). 

I ordered the Hula Burger, which was delicious! The bun was soft, and the meat was juicy. The BBQ sauce added a punch of flavor, while the pineapple provided the perfect fruity sweetness.

The place is a logistical nightmare. Here's why:
-When you go in you see a line up and assume it's the line up to order, but it's the line up to pick up food. Everyone I saw come in stood in the wrong line until they were helped. 

-It appears that they have only 2 friers in the back, and considering the size of the chicken that theoretically means they can only cook 2 pieces at a time. This means unnecessarily long line ups. 

-Not enough seating. 

The food is disappointing. The chicken is nicely cooked, but the breading/skin situation is a mess. The breading layer doesn't adhere to the meat layer and just hangs off. This makes eating it awkward and messy. This problem wouldn't arise if they choose a more conventional shape for the chicken. 

In addition to the lacklustre seasoning, it really shows how the novelty of having a giant flap of chicken doesn't pay off. 

Much like uncle tetsu, it probably appeals more to the asian palate, because it's not nearly seasoned enough to fit the North American definition of fried chicken. And just like tetsu the line ups are horrendous. Don't fall for the hype. There are so many better things to do with your time.",2016-03-11 03:42:56

The tonkatsu ramen had a creamy rich broth. It comes with thin noodles which I like but you can choose your noodle option. The noodles were soft but still had a good bite to it. The ramen comes with woodear mushrooms, charsu pork slices, which melted in your mouth, and green onions. I didn't care for the mushroom. It was super crunchy and flavorless. I would have rather had bean sprouts or bamboo shoots. My friend got the spicy tonkatsu ramen. The soup definitely had a kick.

The decor is cute without a doubt, we went in between the lunch and dinner rush so it was pretty quiet. I was surprised at how ""small"" the menu was, I had just imagined their menu to have a little more variety and nothing really stood out of the menu and screamed ""Try me!"". I decided on the ahi flatbread pizza, which it came out served as literally just ahi pieces thrown on top of a (pretty) flatbread pizza with a smooth avocado spread (would have loved it chunky for a textural component). The flatbread was crispy on the outside and airy in the inside, perfect! And pretty good with the avocado spread but no cohesion with the ahi. I just picked off the ahi from the top and ate it separately. I'm no chef but I could tell you this dish needed an acid element! I wish they had done something to tie the ahi (""star ingredient"") better into the dish. Pretty plating, but basic flavors. I was disappointed and was left thinking ""that's it?"" And for $18 if I recall correctly. I was going to check out but got talked into the salted caramel brownie dessert, let's give them another shot. Waaaaaay too sweet to even enjoy.

4 of us headed on over to Icon after work last night. We got there at like 7:30 and stayed until maybe 8:30? We left, still partially hungry but had an okat time.

-The interior is pretty sweet, the music cycles through American hits, mostly from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, everything is well-kept, the lighting is cool, the decor is stylish, and the temperature was hovering at a perfect level, despite the cold air outside and price of heating. ;)

-Our waitress was cool: fun, humorous, checked in often, but NOT overattentive. She gave solid food advice (even though we sometimes disregarded it... and wished we hadn't, haha!)



---What We Ordered--- 
(Note that the Tapas Tuesday $5 plate deal doesn't apply to their regular tapas menu. They have special menus of alternate items. Don't plan on scoring one of their Octopus tapas plates or Crab Cakes. We were upset by this.)

Peach Sangria Pitcher ($14) - YUM! Great sangria and we got about 8 full glasses out of it.

""Duck Tortilla""  ($5, also $5 on late night menu) - I really liked it, though there weren't any tortillas used in the recipe, to my knowledge. It was more like a shredded duck and spinach fritatta. Moderately sized, compared to the rest. Would totally order again!

""Grilled Steak Skewers"" and ""Grilled Chicken Skewers"" ($5 each, TT exclusive) - These were very tasty, but the serving size was lousy. Don't order. Not worth the price.

""Zuchinni Fries"" ($5 on TT, normally $6) - Recommended. Pretty pleased

""Bacon & Bleu Potato Skins"" ($5, TT exclusive) - Get this! Its basically potato chips, but thicker, less crispy, topped with bacon, cheese, and an excess of jalapeno aoili. Good size, too!

""Roast Chicken Empanada ($5, normally $6) - Tasty, great sauce, very moist, half recommend it.


Recap: Good place to be entertained, grab a snack, or do a pitcher of sangria. Not a great place to fill up. More expensive than expected. (and I'm still upset that http://theiconmadison.com/specials/ doesn't warn you the special only includes a few of their smaller ""run-o-the-mill"" tapas plates.)",2017-11-09 02:00:34

New thing I tried was the pork belly bowl. The rice bowl just has thin slices of belly with some diced green onions, long shave ""premium"" green onion, and red ginger. Its fatty, but not overwhelming in such little slices. It's flavored more delicately than chashu, which has a more ""porky"" cut of meat.

It also took her a long time to flag a server down to ask about her missing drink. 

The interior of the cafe is very warm and cozy. It reminds me of the cafe they have at the bottom floor of Taipei 101. They had a wall of leaves at the front of the store.

July's Review: We were all dressed up to celebrate our fourth anniversary together and this year, I had my boyfriend decide where to eat while I decide what we do. Per my review at the VooDoo Zipline, you can tell we definitely had a fun anniversary activity! (Again, thank you fellow Yelpers for your suggestions!) My boyfriend and I ordered some appetizers alongside our main dish and I appreciate that they came out little by little; if we were bombarded with a table full of food I don't know what I'd do lol. While we sat and waited for our food to arrive, we were given a small basket of bread and I'm not sure what kind of butter they use or what they put in their butter, but it made a simple piece of toast taste like HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH. When we finished eating, our server knew it was our anniversary, so he came out with a small plate of cute little muffins and across the plate, written in chocolate, said ""Happy Anniversary"" It was perfect. Just before leaving, as it was time to pay, they handed us our check tucked inside a journal and I saw so many entries from couples, families, etc and so I decided to leave a cute little message too. Very unique!

October's Review: We dressed casually this time, both hungry for something delicious and since we both liked eating here and liked the service and the ambiance, we opted for something we were familiar with. It was nice and cool out so I was finally able to wear some of my fall/winter clothes (can I get a hellll yeaaaaah?!) and because of how good it felt outside, we dined out at their front patio. The dim Christmas-y type lights that were strung above us created something that felt just a little intimate. It's all about ambiance! I'm not sure if their menu changes every once in a while but the menu looked like it had made a few changes on their dinner dishes. I chose the Salmon dish (I forgot the name) and let me tell you, IT. WAS. ON. POINT. The chopped warm pears added to it took me by surprise but I quickly recovered when they just melted in my mouth. My boyfriend ordered the Filet Mignon (I wanted to devour his food, but lucky for him, he stayed a good distance away) which he said tasted really good. Our food was cooked to perfection! It was a little chilly out, but our bellies were nice and warm. Once we were ready to pay, they handed us our check within the very same journal we were given before. I flipped through the pages to see if our very first entry was still there, and it was! This time Elmer wrote in it.

Apparently, I am a weak-willed women because I eventually gave in to my curiosity a couple of weeks ago and decided to give it a try. 

My boyfriend and I arrived around 9 o'clock and were shocked to see a flock hungry patrons sitting outside, beepers in hand, waiting for a table. We went inside to put our names down and were very impressed with the interior of the restaurant. I am not really one of those people who pics a restaurant based on the design or how 'cool' it is but this certainly worked in Cowfish's favor. 

After our number came up and our beeper started flashing, we were taken to our table and greeted by one of the friendliest waitresses I have ever encountered. We told her we had never been there before and she proceeded to guide us through the very large menu, answering any questions we had as she went. 

We proceeded to order the blackened ahi tuna nachos for our appetizer and we each chose the bento boxes for our entree. When the nachos arrived, I was in awe of how big they were. The 'nachos' are actually fried wontons and they are topped with their crab rangoon dip, pico de gallo, avocado, greens, and delicious ahi tuna. I took my first bite and literally fell in love. The tuna was fresh and all of the toppings tasted like they had been sliced and prepared to order. We scarfed them down in minutes and resisted the urge to place an order for more. 

Our bento boxes arrived soon after finishing the appetizer. I was amazed to see a huge selection of food with very generous portions. The box contained their mini burger of the week, the bib, which was served on a brioche bun with cheddar cheese and chili. The burger was tasty and fulfilled my desire for the comforts of The Counter fare. We moved on to the sweet potato fries (crispy and well-salted), Thai cucumbers (really delicious), and edamame (pretty standard). We saved the sushi roll for last, I selected 'Mark's Roll' which was spicy with jalapeno and siracha and very well-made. My boyfriend had the rainbow roll which was not as good as my roll but still very good.

The General Braddock IPA is a solid performer and my wife liked the Chai beer.  The best, or at least the most interesting beer of the night was the ""And then there was fire"" chipotle double IPA.  I think I got the name right on that one, but I may have slightly butchered it.  I can only describe the feeling as ""drinking a sore throat.""  You take a sip, then a taste of smoky flavor washes over your mouth while a warm, tingly sensation develops in the back of your throat.  You think, ""Man, I just felt fine a minute ago, I hope I'm not coming down with something""....and then you realize that the warming sensation is 9% ABV + capsaicin hitting your mucosa with liquid heat.  At first it was almost unpleasant, but it gradually grew on me and ended up being my favorite beer of the night.  Good work, Gentlemen.",2015-01-21 17:19:03

I was pretty amazed at how desolate downtown Phoenix became after 5PM, but I wanted something relatively light for dinner before exploring the First Friday activities up on Roosevelt Row. It was pretty empty, and the server scurried over to me to make sure I didn't get away. She said to me, ""I hope you know this a vegan restaurant.""

Considering the name, I told her that yes, I was aware and looking forward to trying their food. They certainly offered plenty of dishes on their menu like Spaghetti, Green Curry and Pad Thai. I started with the $12 Shrimp Salad with vegan shrimp tossed with onion, tomato, avocado, cucumber, and lemongrass, all of it mixed in a spicy lime juice dressing (photo: http://bit.ly/2uJwuFt). It was a good, fresh salad, just nothing extraordinary when it came to flavor.

The guy taking my order was super nice and very understanding, he even wrote out what I ordered to make sure it was correct (HUGE BROWNIE POINTS FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE THERE...

The roll was soft and delicious, and the meat & veggies were unbelievably flavorful. The cookie was just as amazing as the other reviews said it would be - gooey and chewy on the inside. The mini meal was the perfect size for lunch, and even then I couldn't finish all of the fries.

She said it was the best meat ball ever.  We got that and a calzone because we were on a limited budget and the prices were very expensive for pasta.  Took it home and while the meat ball was not the best ever, it was pretty darn good.  However, the portion was disappointingly small for the price and the sauce was somewhat bland.

Made it in on a weeknight for a semi-late dinner and had a fantastic time. 

We skipped the drinks this time around, but they had a rather extensive wine menu. The focaccia and pesto they start you with is phenomenal. I'm a huge proponent of good focaccia and Fiamma's recipe is perfect. I barely have words for how good that pesto was. Fresh, aromatic, and strong. The smaller breadsticks in the bread basket were a nice touch as well. 

Entrees were stellar. I stepped out on a limb and ordered the veal chop, which was the special for the evening. Side of gnocchi and a killer red wine reduction. The veal chop was tender and packed with flavor. Stuffed with spinach and onions and each bite was better than the last. While hugely different than what my typical order would be, I was very pleased. The gnocchi....man. So good. Subtle, chewy, sweet with the tomato sauce and fresh herbs, and a perfect combo with the chop. I'd order that as a side dish again in a heartbeat. 

What really set this place apart from other eateries was the service. Our server was one of the most professional I've had in a long time.

The fried catfish po' boy was my catch of the day. When it finally came to the table, I peeked into my sandwich and saw a meager catfish filet that resembled those of my poor college student days. The breading was bland, but the fish was moist. Other than that, they followed through on my request to be easy on the mayo and tartar sauce. Their bread is magical. I don't even know how, but it is.

The service was mediocre. Perhaps it was just a busy night and we were in a hurry, but our food seemed to take forever to get from the kitchen to our table.

On a positive note, our waitress was very accommodating and even put in a rush order for us, which I'm very thankful for.

My first issue was during my initial bridesmaid alterations appointment. I ended up having to wait over an hour and a half while the seamstress was finishing up with a bride, even though I had an appointment and this other woman's appointment ran into mine. The employee was kind, but never apologized.

My second issue was today after going back to the store to pick up the dress after it went through alterations. The hem was not fixed (still too long), and the dress was loose. She claimed she took in exactly what we said we would do, but it felt and looked as though the dress was not altered except for in the shoulders area. I even made sure to wear the same bra/Spanx that I did for my first appointment, but the dress still was too large and not properly altered.

The employees did offer to send it back through alterations, but I opted to not do that as it is nearing too close to the wedding date.

TDLR; having an appointment didn't matter and I had to wait 90 minutes, and then my alterations were not done correctly. Do not recommend this location.",2018-08-24 21:49:29

Mother India is the sister restaurant to Gandhi, both on Queen Street West.

They make the best pappadom (indian cracker made from lentils or chickpeas) out there. Spicy, crispy and all around delish. You can't walk away without trying their pakora's either, drizzled with a sweet sauce ontop. They are known for their rotis, but I think I'll have to try their rice dishes too.

It appears to be the highest rated dive bar on Yelp.  I like drinking.  And I like drinking on the cheap - why not?

After some searching, we finally realized Communist's Daughter doesn't have a sign and it still has the former business sign up.  Okay - this is a bad... sign... I can't think of a single 'we don't have signs' place that (a) wasn't hipster central and (b) completely sucked but people liked because they felt like they were in the know.  We grudgingly enter and scan the room - the place smelled and nothing on the menu looked interesting, so we did a 180 walked back out.

It sucks when you abandon your plans without a Plan B - but sometimes, you stumble upon gems like Get Well, which happened to be just down the block.  The place is pretty big and sufficiently busy on a Thursday night.

But the two big selling points: lots of good beer on tap and free arcade games.  Allow me to repeat: FREE. ARCADE. GAMES.  The full sized classic cabinets.  They had Operation Wolf, Gantlet and Tetris along with 3 or 4 other machines and a couple of pinball machines too.  Occasionally, one of the machines would run out of credits, but I plunked in a quarter and got a bunch more credits.  So, even if not strictly free - it's cheap.

Also, the beer is reasonably priced - so, it actually quite a bit cheaper than trying to finish Gantlet or Operation Wolf in the outside world.  Goddamn, 80's quarter-sucking arcade games were hard.

The only downside is that it can be quite loud.  And it's popular with the hipster kids. But the draft beer is good and reasonably priced.  Sure the games are gimmicky but dammit, I like it.  And fuck the hipsters, I was playing 80s video games before it was cool... (shit...)",2013-01-04 10:37:24

When you book a table and tickets here you must meet a food and drink minimum, which wasn't an issue. Somewhat because we eat and drink a lot and somewhat because they have incredibly inflated prices. I guess this is par for a ballpark, though, so I will let this slide.
The menu was limited and had zero vegetarian entrees. So I got a chicken salad sans chicken and potato skins sans bacon. No price reduction for doing so.
They had a decent variety of liquor, wine and beer available. The food was ""okay"". Nothing that makes it memorable by any means. Service was nice (be forewarned your tip IS included and they will not tell you this). I don't enjoy that. *If the server actually tells me this, I always tip them extra for honesty.

My relationship with Pad Thai is a tumultuous one.  When I first started eating here, typically delivery, I was almost always satisfied.  The food was good.  The quantity was generous.  The price was fair.  No problems really.  Then one day I noticed the prices going up.  Inflation is a necessary evil I suppose.  But more than the irritating price increase was the noticeable decrease in quantity.  Not long after came the most aggregious of offenses.  I started receiving food I did not order nor wanted.  This was the last straw.  For a while at least.

A couple of months ago, after about a two year boycott, my office mates and I returned to Pad Thai.  Not with the delivery orders this time but actually dining in the restaurant off the lunch menu.  We were so impressed that we have been back a couple more times.  The service is fast and friendly and the food is delicious.  The portions look small but it is a deceptive illusion.  Leaving the restaurant I find myself full.   I have ordered three different menu items and have not been disappointed in any of them.  I've had the sweet and altogether comforting panang curry, the ever classic and eponymous pad thai, and a new one for me, prik-khing.  I am a curry nut and apparently this is a type of curry though it really didn't taste like any curry I am used to.  Regarless, it was great and will certainly be added to my regular Thai staples.  The only real source of disppointment here is with the salad.  It is so small and insignificant.  At least the soups, both hot and sour and egg drop, are pretty good and make up for the salad.

Yes, Pad Thai has risen from the ashes to grace our palates once again.  It will continue to do so until such a time comes that they tend towards their past offenses.  I can only hope this does not happen.  I am back on the Pad Thai train and I don't wanna get off.",2016-03-11 17:41:22

I separate Thai food in Las Vegas into three categories: 1. Standard and solid: these are affordable go to places that always get it right and are always satisfying. 
2. Below average: these are the random Thai places that you try once thinking how can someone mess up Thai food and leave without finishing your food and don't take the left overs to go.
3. Those above average Thai places that are elite Thai restaurants in Las Vegas that everyone knows about.

My mom is Thai and I get my Thai fix at home often, but not every dish made at home is restaurant quality. When I tried the spring rolls here it didn't remind me of a Thai dish, but it tasted like the epitome of Thai food. I think we got 4 orders of this. It was the perfect bite. Crunchy and soft texture with sweet, salty, and sour flavors.

Their Tom kha gai was also really good with perfect amount of broth to coconut milk and a good balance of sweet, sour, and spicy.

I also applaud the quality seafood they use. Big tiger prawns. Even in a ""civilian"" dish like pad Thai I thought they did very well. 

Then the mango sticky rice dessert at the end was perfect.

If I ever want to eat something my family doesn't make on the regular I'll definitely be back to Chada for their delicious food. Those spring rolls are a must try.

I guess its no surprise that the Cafe was able to sit us quickly. 

The one star is for the nice hostess that had to attend to our needs 3 different times as our waiter who seemed to have all of 4 tables could not have managed to be less attentive.  

After getting our drinks fairly quickly we waited 10 more min for our waiter. I could swear he was reading off a script when he spoke to us. No smile, no real engagement, no patience and after taking our order we wouldn't see him again for 40 min when our meals arrived. 

After our food arrived he just left. We had to get the hostess to address the overcooked fries that looked like they had been sitting under a heat bulb for quite some time. 

We probably spent 20 min eating and during that time I only saw our waiter once who was looking down at the floor and disappeared into the kitchen before I was able to get his attention. Luckily the nice hostess was preparing some tables behind us. 

My prime rib was very dry, the fries were dried out, my Au Jus cup looked like half of it may have spilled out and of course I ran out. Overall our food experience was well below average especially for a place that tries to appeal to a slightly more discriminating crowd. 

If not for the poor service I probably would not have taken the time to even write a review. Cafe's are a dime a dozen and my food expectations are always low.

Service has been very friendly, you order and they bring the food to your table. Going through the drive-through is very quick as well.

As for the food, they keep the menu simple: chicken fingers, fries, and Texas toast. The breading on the chicken fingers is tasty and I really love the special dipping sauce they provide - not sure how to describe the flavor except that its really good.

Earl of Sandwich, the (gross) 24-hour cafe at Paris, and Tequila Bar at Bally's...that's all we could come up with around our hotel after a long night of gambling and drinking.  Sad.

Since we just wanted to grab something quick before rejoining our friends upstairs, I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla appetizer.  I figured it would be small and simple, but it was really simple.  After popping open the lid, I was greeted with four triangles of quesadilla with scoops of sour cream, guacamole, and salsa on the side.  Really not that impressive, even though it was about what I had expected.  

While they put in a decent amount of chicken, the taste was underwhelming - just not enough spice.  Had there been more cheese, it would have helped the flavor...but it would have made it even oilier.  It was already bad enough seeing the grease/oil it left behind in the container, it was even worse seeing it again in the morning (""Oh man...what the hell were we thinking..."").  For whatever reason, it reminded me of what you get from the food stands at sporting events.
 
Although the food is pretty mediocre, I can't say Tequila Bar was terrible since my friend thought his burger was decent.  They have some cheap deals if you're looking to stay on a budget ($2 tacos it seems), but I would probably just go over to Earl of Sandwich for some late eats.

The ending wouldn't suggest that The first Act was more comedic than dramatic.  At times, hilarious as the jealous Cosca became increasingly irate of the beautiful woman her lover Mario is painting (Mary Magdalene - see 1st pic posted) lol & Scarpio's jealously of Mario is at first funny.  Funnier when he starts torturing and threatening to lap of heads (you can hear Mario's friend screaming out off stage through the torture chamber door..singing his torture in a classic beautiful Opera way.

Cosca's character cycles through a broad spectrum of emotions from jealous, loyal, venegeful, and religious and moral at the end before she jumps to her deAth while singing "" I will now be judged before God with you..you bastard Scorpio"".  Is this all about her and Scorpio ?  Is she a sociopath too?  what about the poor artist Mario who got caught up in all of this?  Did he deserve to die?  maybe, but shouldn't she be calling out for his love before vengeance witn Scarpio?  Hmmm...a peak into her true character here.  But Leah Crocetto's acting & beautiful singing have the audience believing her to be more of a jealous & funny character who is chasing an artist who feels trapped in the situation and is staying with her to survive.  Sure there are different interpretations of Cosca and this one is a believable one. And Compassion grows for Cosca despite her flaws as the futility of the situation becomes evident.  And her singing is so beautiful!  Gives the audience no choice but to fall in love with her despite her character flaws. Is this an observation of life and the character flaw exceptions we make for athletes, beautiful actresses, and the extremely wealthy?  

In the end, the fake execution for Mario was real.  The Power mongering and heartless Scarpio has been murdered, killed by Cosca.  And her lover is dead, victim of a ""fake execution"".  Her choice to believe the sociopath she murdered (who's fault is that?) is a poor one.  This Opera is going GOT on us...and Cosca, true to the words we all know ""Elivs has left the building"" or I mean it aint over until the fat lady sings"" as she falls to her death..exit stage center down!  

Bravo, fricking loved this Opera!  2 Thumbs way up!

Lastly, trying to research the origin of ""It's not over to the fat lady sings...I found this and thought I hope that it is true.  Great legend...and I'm having a change of heart about Al Capone.  Opera can move an audience in mysterious ways..

Fwd...(from a bloke in Dublin) The way I heard it was that in the twenties Al Capone developed a taste for opera, mugging up assiduously on recordings, and one night went to a live performance of Tosca, accompanied by two bodyguards. These gents, who hadn't done the same homework as Al, got up to go at the end of the first aria, only for Al to drag them back into their seats, snarling ... you guessed it.

So far I have not tried the sweet waffles, but on the savory waffle front I'm in love with the Waffidilla add the avocado and the West Coast. Both full of cheese and meaty goodness inside a perfectly cooked waffle. 

The coffee is amazing! On your first visit you must have the Tiffs Waffle Macchiato. It has a churro waffle in a very strong, slightly cinnamon flavored coffee. My favorite is the Espresso Frankenstein. It's perfect if you enjoy the taste of coffee. Plus, as sweetener they use is agave. Yay!

The service is spot on and everyone is talkative, energized and helpful. If you go in often you will get to know them and how sweet they really are. The atmosphere a is pure coffee shop, random tables that don't match and chairs that are odd. I do love the long wood bench that runs the length of the wall.

The food was very tasty as well. Started with the guac which easily landed in my top 3 guacs ever. The chips were served warm and crispy and whole(no crumbles or partial chips shows attention to detail). They didn't quite provide enough chips but were happy to bring us some extras when we asked. The next course came too quickly and was a the arugula salad. Very fresh ingredients and tasty. I think possibly the best crouton ever, goat cheese on top. I think there could've been a bit more of a punch (possibly some balsamic) involved in the whole salad. The veggie burger again came out too quick and kind of felt like they were trying to rush us through each course while I was sitting there savoring the flavors. I think it could've served them better to let the burgers sit under the warmer until I finished the salad. By the time I got to the burger it was cold-ish and I know the flavor would've been more appealing if it was warm. The brioche they served the burger on was fantastic and definitely the highlight of the dish. Their deserts were very rich. The fondant was great. I wish the brownie was a bit warm as it would've gone great with the ice cream it was served with. 

Another issue I had was I couldn't understand what occasion I would go there for. The seats were just a bit too far apart for a date. It was a bit pricier than a family place should be.

I had heard from another friend that My Big Fat Greek Restaurant had an express restaurant up the street from work and thought that was the place I am going to try!  

Worked my way up the counter and was greeted by a noninterested/rude teller who looked and acted like she had better things to do then take my order.  I dismissed that and placed my order anyways, I ordered the Aegean Club minus the gyro meat, because I am not a fan of lamb, but when I asked to have the gyro meat removed I got an eye roll, then I asked for it to be paired with a Greek salad and would like a water for drink (I don't drink soda and wasn't in the mood for tea) then my friend placed her order and bill was rang up I handed her the card and asked her if there was a to go menu, since this was my 1st there I wanted to see what all they had to offer, without a single word she looked at me then looked to the left as in dummy don't you see them right there.   

Ok it's the rude service at the cash teller that I base my 3 star rating on, if there was a 2 &  1/2 star option I would take that, because at the end of the day, it's a fast food business, it's the tellers job to take my order and maybe answer a question or 2 I might have since this was my 1st time to this establishment, and now I am left with the impression that really I don't want to go back and place another order.

The Aegean Club, omg it was delish! It was a great pita, tender chicken, bacon!!! tzatziki, lettuce, tomato and a chipotle mayo on it, it normally comes with gyro meat, but I'm not a fan of lamb so I had it removed! It was so yummy!!  I paired it with a Greek Salad and that was a perfect combo!!

It is one of the newest hot spots of the strip. I had also heard that the place was owned by the same people who own MGM grand.

I have to say it is really cool looking from the outside. They have a really neat futuristic architecture design. My friend commented how the building looked like it was twisted. They also have a lot of unique looking sculptures both outside and inside.

I actually expected the lobby of the hotel to be more grand. It's a bit on the plain side. It's neat though. They have a bunch of soft benches with high wooden backs. I can't quite describe the carpet but it had some neat orange designs. I'm sure people who are exhausted from walking around appreciate all the places where they can sit. There is also the latest music being played throughout the casino.

Attached to the casino is a shopping center. It's a pretty cool place. At first it almost felt like I was at a convention center - too white and big but then I walked downstairs and this was where I discovered how really cool it is. The stairs have these pretty and unique flower designs that light up. Plenty of tourists were taking their special kodak moments here. There were also different fountains where the colors changed constantly. Little kids were playing there because every time you touched the fountain water would come down from the inside and the colors would change. Shopping-wise this place had the coolest shops. The Louis Vuitton store was amazing. It was huge and very fancy. One of the best looking Louis Vuitton stores I've seen.

Aria definitely is a cool looking place. (Oh and they're not bad slot machine wise too...those machines tend to give a little and not necessarily take all your money hehe).

So I have ordered many things at this place but I do not have pictures for all of the things I have ever ordered. I tried their Gyoza (pan fried japanese dumplings), spicy tonkatsu ramen, curry rice with karage, karage, takoyaki, and I think that's it. I like all of these things and they do a pretty good job at making all of them. I wouldn't say one stands out as being the best in Toronto or the best ever, but they are tasty and good. Takoyaki has a decent amount of octopus inside, not overlooked, crispy on outside and soft on inside. Gyoza are fine, just regular fried dumplings (although my favourite are the ones are Ryu noodle bar on Baldwin). Ramen comes in three different size options (small, regular, large), the ramen is always cooked to perfection, the additional cabbage and bean sprouts and corn and pork they put on it makes the whole dish work really nicely, and the broth i think is terrific too. The curry is good, nothing extremely special about it, it's a good Japanese curry. And the karage (japanese fried chicken) is moist on the inside and crispy on the outside too, it also comes with a side of Japanese mayo. 

The broth they have at this place (especially for the spicy tonkatsu ramen, since that's the only one I've tried at this place) is richer and very flavourful. Some people like their broth really light, so if you do I don't think you will like their broth. But I think everyone should give it a try cause it really is good and hearty and very very flavourful! 

This place also is constantly on the hunt for new inventive ramen and just today I saw some new ramen thing they are offering in collaboration with some famous chef in Japan I think. I want to give this a try next time. 

This place isn't overly expensive and is pretty student friendly in my opinion. Especially compared to all the other places to eat downtown for students, this place is one of the good ones. I'll definitely keep coming back and so should you.",2016-01-07 19:44:27

Firenza is North Charlotte's solution to South End's Blaze location. It's located in the Target shopping center that's near Northlake Mall. It's a bit on the smaller side, compared to Blaze's large, open feel. 

I visited today during my lunch as well as last week when they were offering the $2 pizza promotion donation. NIGHT AND DAY between those two visits. Last week, the line was wrapped around the inside and the place was fully-staffed. Today's visit, there was nobody in line and about three or four employees behind the counter. The guy who prepared my pizza seemed to be a little out of it? I don't know, it was kind of hard to figure out his demeanor but he was well-meaning. He started off by spelling my name wrong even though I spelled it out three times and he seemed to still be learning the menu because I asked for a menu pizza (the Texas BBQ) and he had to keep referencing his guide throughout the pizza prep.

Both visits, the employees operated on the slower side. To me, fast-casual means fast prep to be enjoyed in a casual restaurant environment. They haven't caught on to the 'fast' part yet, so I'll chalk this up to the new-ness of the place.

Pretty much the same veggie and meat options are offered here as Blaze, however, Firenza does have broccoli as choice unlike Blaze. BIG plus for me because I love broccoli on pizza. They also offer milkshakes, a coca cola freestyle machine, and sweet tea drink options. My total for a 10"" pizza and regular drink came to $10.49. 

I do enjoy Blaze's pizza crust better but I think the Firenza staff is still figuring out pizza prep because my crusts were different this week vs last week. Most likely, I will be visiting Firenza more frequently solely due to the convenience of its location to my job.",2017-01-17 01:40:31

I think the floors are the type that never look very clean, so they need constant attention.  The vent in the bathroom is a tell tale sign of overall lack of attention to cleaning details not to mention the drink station.

I saw ""first date"" in the booth theater, top notch production!

I loved how they offer last minute tickets (with discount -not just for students!) for same day sales, which was great for someone like me traveling through town and unsure about the production or theatrical company quality.

Only downsides were:
-Not sure how ""local"" the theater was, seems like the Tech elements were locally based (including local features on the set), but the ""talent"" seemed to be mostly from NYC (other than the great audience members who were seated onstage).
-On the web site it says last minute tickets are available, all day same day, all box office hours, but in reality they are only offered after 6, and you need to get in line, despite having open and ready ticket sellers before the 6pm hour.

Now, being in the medical field, I have my fair share of friends from all over India and from Pakistan as well...and they all love to cook their spicy food for the little white girl thinking that ""she can't handle it"".  The looks of shock and despair when I wolf down their hottest family concoctions and proclaim them only mild or medium are quite amusing to my sadistic sense of humour (and shush, I'm Canadian, that's how we spell it!).

Indian cuisine is one of my favorites and I haven't had it since moving to Cleveland in July...I was in definite withdrawal and dying for it and managed to grab some take-out from Indian Delight last night to share with a friend.

Phone order went a little something like this...

Me: Could I get a Chicken Madras and Rogan Josh along with a Neelgiri Korma?
Owner: Sure, how spicy would you like them?
Me: Indian spicy for the first two and medium for the Korma (traditionally Kormas are mild or medium and for my dining partner's sensitivity b/c I neglected to ask them if uber-spicy stuff was ok, lol)
Owner: ....*Pause*.....
Me:  Hello?
Owner:  You say ""Indian spicy""??
Me: yes, the hottest you can make it....
Owner:  ok....uh, any lassi to go with that?

So, after I got in the order and brought it home we got to tuck in to some really excellent food.  Their Papri Chat is top notch....for the love of god people, don't order samosas every time you go to an Indian restaurant...try some of the more authentic stuff to start off with!

Requisite garlic naan and basmati rice to go along with the main dishes.  Madras and Rogan Josh were both excellent but I found the Korma a little lacking, seemed like it might have been a local variant that wasn't exactly my favorite.  Indian spicy?  Glad I ordered it that way because it was only about a medium in my books, but definitely excellent enough to be back for more!

Can't really comment on the restaurant since I just got take-out, but the owner met me at the door and was really nice and my food was just ready when I got there (they were pulling the naan out of the oven as I was walking in the door).  Another customer was there also waiting to pick up his order and said that the Biryani was the best thing on the menu (noted for the next occasion, although I make a pretty good biryani of my own!).

The Riparian Preserve at Water Ranch in Gilbert (part of the Greater Phoenix Metro area) has a secret that, unless you are willing to search out hidden gems, you might never have known was there. 

Water Ranch Lake is a lake just behind the Gilbert Library with a short hiking trail around it. Approximately 1/2 mile on a concrete trail. Easily accessible for strollers & wheel chairs. Also, it's a great little fishing spot with a variety of fish. 

If you want more, there are extensive (for the middle of a city) trails around seven (7) ponds that harbor 202 different types of birds. You won't see them all in one outing. Some are seasonal, some year-round residents. Everything from hummingbirds to vultures and multiple in-between varieties. Even a couple of exotics. Check out their Hiking Map for a complete list of birds.

The extensive dirt trails around the 7 ponds will take you past a ramada, an observatory (open on weekends & special moon/star sightings), a burrowing owl habitat, an archeological dig site, a dinosaur dig site, some petroglyphs, and multiple photo sites. 

Wear your hat, bring sunscreen and a good camera with a telephoto lens. You might want to pack a peanut butter & jelly sandwich and a couple bottles of water too. There are no fast food stops and no place to buy a soda. Make a morning or afternoon of it, There are benches every so often and restrooms.

The portions have definitely increased since our last visit, everything was big! The flavors have gotten stronger, much stronger too, to the point some of the dishes were a little bit too salty for us. So they just can't find a balance point, but it's much better than tiny portions with no flavors if you ask me! 

Tapas:
Yellowtail & tuna cones, fisherman's soup, grilled tuna belly, vegan sautéed spinach, lobster with angel hair pasta, ribeye rare plus and spicy pork meatballs. 

Loved tuna cones and lobster angel hair pasta, the lobster and grilled tuna belly were a bit too smoky for me, especially the lobster, but the pasta was amazingly flavorful, it was so good! Hubby loved the ribeye, so tender and rare enough for him. The spinach was too salty, as well as the soup. Spicy pork meatballs were flavorful and very spicy, hubby liked them a lot. 

For desserts we had three flavors of sorbets and creme brûlée, loved the mandarin orange sorbet, creme brûlée was heavenly yummy! 

Overall the food was so delicious, the presentations were so beautiful. I had a glass of white sangria, it was very refreshing and tasty. Service was friendly and fairly attentive considering how busy they were. 

Think we will come back whenever we want tapas in Vegas, cause they have many seafood, vegetarian / vegan choices on the menu, that's a big YES for me! 

Ps. They have good happy hour menu, definitely take advantage of that if you don't want to spend big bucks at this restaurant!",2015-06-11 08:46:42

Drinks. Yes, they're pricey. They will be pricey at pretty much any major venue. Get there early and go pregame at VBGB or Small Bar. Two great places to grab drinks. Both located on either side of The Fillmore.

I love the light fixtures. Super nice. Stage height is good. There's not really a bad place to stand on the floor for a show.

Some great bartenders slinging drinks. Lori and Chrissy are longtime pros behind the bar. You can usually find them in the VIP section.

The only downfall of this place is it's connected to Live Nation. Pay attention to the Fillmore and Jeff Hahne's (music editor for Creative Loafing) social media... they keep you updated when there are specials. Every once in awhile you can get tickets for shows without all those extra fees tacked on. It's like Christmas! 

My latest show was this past weekend. Flogging Molly. Sold out. Tremendous as always. For a sold out show, I didn't feel overwhelmed or squished.

Milestones is the place where you go to for the sake of ""easy"", a too sweet bellini and a decent enough burger.  However, one of my dining partners tonight is a huge fan of Top Chef and insisted we go to try their seasonal ""top chef"" menu and so we did tonight.  Shoulda had the burger...

The starter pork croquettes tasted strangely like chicken liver, whereas another likened it to canned tuna fish.  Texture was very odd. 

Main was the sablefish with seaweed gnocchi.  My fish had the skin on it, which was face down in the broth, so by the end of the meal, I had this black scaly goop which was so very unappetizing.  The fish itself was nice, clean tasting, no real flavour.  The seaweed gnocchi had no flavour at all and I likened it to mushy pablum.  Broth was sour/sweet odd but I was happy for any flavour at all by that point.   Also, one of us found 4 fish bones in her fish, while 2 of us found none.  Chew slowly!  

Dessert-a DISASTER.  Strawberry shortcake with lemon curd.  They used salt instead of sugar for the lemon curd.  Made one of us gag and almost throw up.  They took it off the bill.

So in the end, the best part of the meal was the too sweet bellini.  Makes us wonder....if these dishes were the winners of Top Chef...poor McEwan.",2011-06-01 02:42:57

This is definitely a high end restaurant which is perfect for date night, birthdays, or any special occasion. The interior decor is modern and contemporary. I decided to treat my boyfriend by taking us here for dinner last Friday. We arrived around 7 pm and were seated quickly. 

We both started by sharing a Caesar salad and had a white and red sangria. The drinks and salad came out extremely fast. For our main course we both ordered the prime rib with fries. It took a longer amount of time waiting for the prime rib. This was because the salad was brought out way too quickly. Our server was very friendly and attentive throughout our visit which was great. She came by to let us know about our prime rib orders as she knew we were waiting. The prime rib was very tender and easy to cut through. Mine was cooked to medium rare so I was happy. My boyfriend ordered a medium prime rib but it looked just like mine. I didn't really like the au jus that came with the prime rib. It was thicker than most places I've had it and it tasted different.

Overall, we had a good dining experience for our first visit here. The total for our date night was about $100 including gratuity.

For almost all the dishes, I used one specific combo of sauces. I add soy sauce with some chili  and swirl around until a good consistency. Absolute fave and the one thing that masked the blandness.

I don't think I would ever go there just for the pizza, but it does have a lot of other stuff going for it. We also had wings, again, good, but not great, and beer, always great!

Second trip - I went to watch football on Sunday morning. While this is a Buffalo Bills bar, the Bills had played on Thursday that week, so it was more of a free for all. The crowd was very fun and friendly, the bartender, who was the same bartender as my first trip, remembered me and my beer of choice (pretty good for only my second trip) and was very friendly and helpful.

The restaurant is gorgeous, very gamie, outdoorsy feel to mixed with a almost fine dining decor.

So I've eaten at Cracker Barrel on two different occasions many, many years apart. I vaguely remembered the first time around that I thought they had really good syrup. Why syrup would stand out and not the meal? Not sure. Well, fast forward like 7-8 years, and I think they still have good syrup, and my entree was highly forgettable. For my entree I went with pancakes, eggs, and bacon. Kind of a staple breakfast for a place that caters to breakfast connisieurs. The pancakes were overcooked, and not just a little overcooked, like dark brown. The bacon was good, crispy just like I ordered it. The eggs, which I ordered over medium, were clearly cooked on way too hot of a griddle and closer to over easy. Pancakes had a decent flavor had they been cooked better.

My wife ordered the chicken fried steak dinner. Another blah-zay option. Gravy didn't have a ton of flavor. The meat did taste a little funny. Again, as a place that is comfort food city, you expect these meals to be decent, and they weren't.

The service also left something to be desired as well. We went on a Friday night, so we expected it to be busy. However, when the third waiter came over to help us, after placing our drink order two prior times it got a little frustrating. We also were dining with our 18 month old and always place his order with our drink order. We asked if we could get some of the biscuits they offer so that the little guy could get his eat on sooner than later. After 15 minutes, asking 4 separate people, we finally got the biscuits, followed by his meal about 30 seconds later. Our meals took another 15 minutes to come out. By the time we got our food a good 40 minutes had passed, we had an antsy toddler, and we were done. When the food comes out and it's less than desirable, it becomes Jason's Series of Unfortunate Events.

PS - the biscuits we eventually got were the most tasteless things I've ever tried in my entire life. Pillsbury canned biscuits are like 11x better.

You had an option of buying individual ammo, like 9 mm pistol rounds or belts for the machine guns or there were packages to chose from. I thought the packages were the way to go.

In the past year I have eaten in your Peoria store not less than 30 times. We use this place to meet with our friends and children. We can come in get something to eat and chat. 

Tonight my wife and I went there to eat. She ordered a bowl of tomato basil soup and I ordered the same in a bread bowl. The bread bowls just have a small divot in the top for the soup. This divot is much to small for a cup of soup and it spills into the plate. I asked if enough bread could be removes to hold the soup without it spilling onto the plate. Nothing was said. When my order was delivered to the table the person proceeded to tell me that if I wanted it that way in the future they would have to charge me for a bowl of soup instead of a cup. 

I never asked for any special consideration on the price when I ordered the soup. Would not that of not been the time to tell me that it would cost more to fix the soup the way I wanted ?? The person that delivered the soup then proceeded to lecture me on the fact that I had gotten more than I had paid for. I asked her to please leave. I had to do this twice as she continued to try and lecture. 

I did not get her name. She was about 5'8"" slim light brown hair. Probably 20 or less. I should of called for the manager but at that time I was so mad I just ate my soup and left. 

I have been eating out for many years. This is the worst service I have ever had. Maybe you think one out of 30 times in the restaurant is acceptable for bad service. I don't!!

I did write a letter to the Corporate Office.  Lets see if they care?",2010-12-05 03:10:43

My Husband and I stayed at the Westin after our wedding and it holds centimental value for us, so when we were in need of a spa day recently the Westin was our first choice.  We booked the Travelzoo massage in advance and were greeted promptly upon our arrival.  Everything seemed to go well with check-in and we were shown to our respective locker rooms.  I didn't find the actual facilities to be anything special.  It had all the basic things and seemed a-ok.  Honestly, I don't even remember it well and that was less than a month ago.

Now, the massage.  I have to say this in one of, if not the worst, massages I have ever had.  I asked for ""medium"" pressure and got the massage of my nightmares.  She was so aggressive I thought I was going to be pushed right through the table.  It was awful, painful, and the complete opposite of relaxing. I spent most of the time wondering when it will be over.  I thought to myself this must be an annomoly, but NO, my Husband had the exact same experience.  He even asked his massuse to let up, but she didn't.  We both walked away more than disappointed.  Afterwards we hung out by the spa pool, which was nice and quiet compared to the main pool area.  Service was OK... honestly the best part of the whole day was the boneless buffalo wings and bannana smoothie.  Those were to die for.

Upon reflection, I realized we never got our mimosa or foot massage as part of the Travelzoo package.  Just another disappointment, but I didn't even care to bring it to anyone's attention.  I really enjoy hitting up local spas during the summer and thanks to Travelzoo I usually get them at a good price for the quality.  This time, anything over $1 was too much for this spa experience.  To say we were disappointed is the understatement of the year.  We won't be back.",2014-07-31 18:07:06

A thousand times better than the major chains and a million times better than grocery store donuts. I stopped in on our way to a play date, as this shop is near our friends' house. Super friendly lady called out from the back that she would be right with us. The display cases held a variety of temptations and the smell wafting throughout the shop was intoxicating.

I made our selections while my 3 year old son jumped up and down in excited anticipation. In addition to the kid-appeal cake donuts (chocolate and vanilla) covered in a variety of sprinkles and frostings, I also selected Boston cream, raspberry-filled, sugar raised and toasted coconut. The lady rang up our purchase, thanked me with a warm smile and gave me a frequent-guest punch card.

We arrived at our friends' house with the box of deliciousness, and let the kids select their choices first. My fellow mom friend picked a toasted coconut and I took a Boston cream. We each immediately fell in love with our choices. The Boston cream was beyond fresh, with a nicely intense, silky smooth chocolate frosting and a luxurious custard filling. I also got to sample the last bite of my son's chocolate cake donut with chocolate frosting and rainbow sprinkles. It was delicious, just fresh, not at all greasy and ever so slightly crispy along the edges.

I brought home a toasted coconut to my husband and he was equally smitten, saying how good it was even after sitting all day.

Always something of an outlier in the Las Vegas culinary scene, its Vodka Lounge clearly an impetus to place a Restaurant themed on the former Soviet Union near Mandalay Bay's primary entrance, guests will easily recognize Red Square as the Restaurant harboring a headless statue outside, the likeness of V.I. Lenin decapitated in 1999 amidst controversy but in the process creating another ""Vegas"" moment whereby visitors can don furs and do shots off the head in sub-zero temperatures.
 
Situated just off the Casino floor en route to a dining collection that remains one of Sin City's best, Mandalay Bay's numbers unfortunately still lagging some six months after the tragic events of October, it was shortly after checking in at the hostess stand that a table for six was readied beneath a sizable chandelier at room's center, music as well as lights subdued with a red hue making the latter a challenge for amateur Food photographers.

Presenting a one-sheet bill of fare in print that may see older patrons pulling out lighted magnifiers, a much thicker list suggesting a collection of Wines, Cocktails and Spirits, it was abiding to the theme that drinks such as a Moscow Mule, KGB and White Ruskie were requested, each well crafted from top-shelf liquor but at the same time subject to ""Strip pricing"" at a base of $18.

Ordering broadly from various sections, a request for plates to be coursed out flanked by two surprises attempting to create a true 'tasting menu' experience, it was with a trio of Caviar bites that dinner began, housemade Blinis as well as a crispy Potato Chip offering delicate support for everything from Trout to Golden Osetra with each distinct, delicious and also available in traditional by-the-ounce service.

Allowing the kitchen to dictate the pace, a pre-theater surge dying down by eight o'clock allowing Chef Concepcion to spend time describing his extensive research in recreating the concept, it was to the benefit of two children that crunchy Fingerlings with dipping Sauces joined a collection of imported Charcuterie for round one, the chunky Pate of Pork and Beef amongst many highlights but Troyanka's spin on Finochietta stealing the show with big notes of Paprika showing where Fennel often overwhelms.

Moving on to a collection of Starters and Salads, most surprisingly well portioned at prices that range $14-$16, it is not even in the simple Chop Salad that Concepcion goes low-effort as a pile of Vegetables is enlivened by housemade 'pickled' Vinaigrette, the use of Dill prominent but restrained just as it is with Scallop Crudo that even the Kids found enjoyable as their parents focused on what can best be described as ""Grandma's"" Stuffed Cabbage without any Rice and superior quality ground Meat.

Happy to see a collection of Dumplings given their own headline, the lack of Chicken Paprikash forgivable even though it would seem better-suited as an entrée than Chicken under a Brick, the decision of where best to invest another $15-$17 comes down to one's personal preferences though those dining as a group would be well-served to order all three, the Vareniki probably 'safest' as Christian's Pasta making skills are exhibited in Mushroom Ravioli though the Pierogis should be prioritized by those familiar as they are as good as what one will find in the 'ethnic' shops of Pittsburgh or Cleveland.

Further impressed by Khachapuri, the Georgian boat of bubbling Cheese cooking an Egg added tableside into a gooey Fondue eaten like Pizza, it was by way of three Entrees and an equal number of sides that savories came to a conclusion, Escoffier's model for Beef Wellington serving Salmon inside delicate Puff Pastry for just $29 while the Stroganoff and tongue-in-cheek ""Gorba"" Chop were both highlight reel dishes priced affordably for sharable portions, the former brightened by Carrots and Dill while the Bone-in Short Rib eats like Portofino's Osso Bucco amidst springy Egg Noodles.

Slowing down at this point, Brussels Sprouts gone and only a few spoonfuls of sweet Cabbage or Mushrooms n' Cheese remaining, it was with palates cleansed by Coffee that three Desserts were offered, this part of the experience still ""a work in progress"" according to Chef Concepcion and only the buttery Bread Pudding currently on the menu, though with any luck the flaky Pastry filled with fresh Cheese, Fruit and Nuts as well as pan-seared Dumplings full of Juniper-perfumed Berries will be quick to join it.

I had a business meeting here yesterday with several colleagues during lunch time. We made reservations for 10 and they had our table ready when we arrived. They were prompt about taking our drink orders which I really appreciate because I was parched!

We also ordered two appetizers. One was a chicken lettuce wrap type dish which I didn't care for. The other was a tamale appetizer which was heavenly. I could have eaten the whole plate by myself. If you like Mexican food, you have to try this! I already planned to come back just for this dish.

My steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and was so tender. It had a glaze on it that was a little sweet and I appreciate that it wasn't drowned in the glaze. It was like they brushed it on so there was just a hint of it. The wasabi mashed potatoes were great! Being wasabi, I expected them to be spicy but they weren't at all. They had the flavor of wasabi without the spice which was a nice compliment to the steak. 

Last, but not least, we ordered cheesecake. You can't go to The Cheesecake Factory without trying the cheesecake! They have several different flavors and there's definitely something for everyone. I got the dulche de leche cheesecake. If you're unfamiliar with that, it means caramel basically. It came with nuts on it and fresh whipped cream. DIVINE! Because I was so full from my meal, I was only able to eat half of my dessert so I saved the rest for today which I will happily devour when I get home from work tonight. 

Our waitor was very attentive and he didn't seems to mind all of our special requests and our need for drink refills every time he turned around. He was also very helpful when some of us asked about certain menu items and suggested some of his favorite dishes as well.

Overall, it was a wonderful dining experience and I look forward to bringing friends and family back here to enjoy all the deliciousness that The Cheesecake Factory has to offer.",2015-07-30 11:04:20

The desserts are also delicious. Where else can you get pineapple coconut ice cream?

I saw someone mention this place on the ""Yelp talk"" stating that they had organic grass-fed beef so I looked up the menu and the prices were very fair for top notch quality ingredients on a variety of unique and exciting burger topping creations. We almost didn't go because it's 25 min from where we live but it sounded so worth it, so we made the drive and are so glad we did! 

When we got there around 530pm, the whole parking lot was empty and so was the restaurant. Our waitress was the only one visible when we walked in, she was at the counter and walked up to us immediately with menus and sat us down at a booth spot. She got us our waters and gave us a few minutes to look over the menu. Another couple walked in while we looked over the menu. Throughout our meal two delivery guys came in and had big bags of orders and a group of 4 came to dine in as well, so it was not empty the whole time! The place is dimly lit and very casual but still clean and nice. Not very big. 

We ordered the sweet potato tots with the Yelp check-in, the truffle fries, the fried pickles assortment, the 3am burger, and the red bird burger. 

You can choose a certified angus beef patty, an organic grass-fed beef patty, or an all-natural chicken patty with any of their creations listed on their menu. We both chose the organic grass-fed beef. 

The 3am burger was so juicy, it was dripping all over the place. He ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. It was so A M A Z I N G. Everything about it was on point. 

My Red Bird Burger was also dripping all over the place, the yuzu BBQ sauce and cheese were so good. I asked for well done, it was perfect and still so, so juicy!! 

The truffle fries were really good. Amazing flavor. But we wish the fries were crispier!!

The sweet potato ""tots"" are not tots at all, they are huge and fluffy. Not bite-size and crispy. They are like mashed sweet potatoes in a deep-fried crust. IDK if that sounds good to you - it wasn't that good to us. 

The deep fried pickles assortment was really quite good. I feel the other veggies were even better than the pickles though. The batter was very light and super crispy. Yuuummmm!

Overall, it was worth the drive!! Love all the options they have on their menu, I want to try them all! the prices were super fair! The burgers were SO GOOD! And the service was very fast and very friendly. This place deserves to be busier than it was!! If you're looking for a big, juicy and gourmet burger check this place out!",2017-02-13 03:54:09

Tonight we were tasting from the Pio Cesare vineyards of Northern Italy.  The main presenter was Carmelo Messina, a Gold Pin Sommelier.  The food courses were prepared by Francesco Di Caudo, executive chef.  
First tasting was of Piodilei Langhe Chardonnay DOC.  This wine had a creamy somewhat sweet, ripe fruit and a long finish.  Was accompanied with Capesante Scottate--a seared sea scallop drizzled with a grape and balsamic vinaigrette dressing complemented with sweet potato puree, cauliflower couscous, pomegranate and persimmons.  All very delicious and enhanced the delicate sea scallop.  Second course was a fresh home-made ricotta cheese, served with celery root julienne, yam chip and broccoli tip.  Extremely fresh, creamy and pared with Barbera d Alba DOC, a wonderful red.  This wine had a full structure, spice and ripe fruits, blackberry and matched with this cheese course beautifully.  The next course was Vitello Tonnato, a wonderful presentation of a tuna salad with fresh sage, onion, capers and mayonnaise wrapped in beef tenderloin atop a crisp chip and small greens.  The flavors of the beef and tuna salad matched well and the wine pared was Bararesco, DOCG. This red wine was great, had a light elegant spicy fruit flavors a gentleness with great depth.  The last course was Cappellacci di Bue Brasato--a wonderful ravioli filled with beef short rib and celery all served with the short rib sauce and topped with parmigiano reggiano cheese.  This course was fabulous, the flavors of the short rib in the fresh ravioli complimented the wine--Barolo, DOC.  This wine had an excellent fruit balance, medium body and excellent.
The taste and learn series tonight was wonderful, had a great time with the wines and the food courses were fabulous.  Look forward to the next event.",2015-11-22 20:32:54

On our waitress' recommendation we started off the night with an order of wings. When they came out ours eyes were like.. Whoa! and after the first bite our tastebuds had plenty of questions. They were juicy on the inside but kinda dry rubbed with spices on the outside. They were a little sweet, a little spicy, a lot of messy... and some of the best wings we've ever had the pleasure of demolishing. It didn't take us but a few short minutes to turn that gorgeous plate of wings into a pile of bones.

Next we got the Three Little Pigs BBQ Sandwich topped with slaw and blueberry tamarind chutney with some potato salad on the side. The potato salad was forgettable but the pulled pork and blueberry chutney was amazing. I'd suggest swapping out the bread for something less dense and overpowering but overall this dish gets a recommend :)

Ella ordered the Brisket tacos with cheddar cheese and salsa verde. The Brisket was tender and full of flavor, it was loaded with gooey cheddar cheese  and the salsa verde added the perfect hint of spice. The only thing this taco needed was a dallop of sour cream... perhaps a dallop of daisy. The black-eyed pea salad is probably one of the best we've ever come across and on our top ten list of favorite foodie menu items. The chipotle beef tacos were made with Korean bulgogi beef, topped with a salsa de arbol, and wrapped in corn tortillas.

Despite Krazy Fish not being a Mexican restaurant... the bulgogi beef tacos were probably some of the best we have ever sank our teeth into and the macaroni was oven baked and as fresh as homemade can get. The blackened tuna tacos came with an Asian slaw and were a little too blackened for Ella's palate but the slaw cooled it down a little and we still easily recommend it for the average person. The jalapeño cheddar cheese grits soufflé was great... according to me, but Ella said she's had better. 

We also got the southern fried fish wrapped in flour tortillas with a ""Pink Gold sauce"" and slaw. The fish was fried perfectly and was well balanced by the crunchy slaw. The best part of this taco though was the pink gold sauce, i just wished it had about a gallon more. Last but not least... the cuban chicken tacos with corn tortillas and salsa verde.  Not real heavy on the spicy cuban flavor but still enough to make us smile.

Its not often we get to add a restaurant to our favorites list.. but Krazy fish definitely deserves the honor. They have great food, a great staff, budget friendly pricing, and oh yeah... did we mention GREAT FOOD!!!!",2015-07-06 02:51:17

Esteban I rarely see because they sometimes have him working at a different store.

My favorite cashier, Maddie, is always helpful with my Spanish and very pleasant.  All the older cashiers, whether male or female are awesome and super friendly.  The younger male cashiers are good, too.  Sometimes the younger female cashiers are a bit too serious and not as friendly, but that's okay for me.

The produce guys mainly speak Spanish, so I have new people to get to know.

Manuel in the Butcher's area helps me with my Spanish and I enjoy my weekly visits to the Meat Counter.  He is always excellent in customer service with a friendly smile.

They could use outside the store in the parking lots better cart returns.  The ones they have are awful.  The Bashas family which ones all the Food Cities should install similar cart returns to WinCo.

However, I've noticed that a large number of people who shop here don't use the cart returns.  They just leave the baskets wherever and that includes the driving aisle.  A pet peeve of mine and usually I'll round up a few baskets and put them nicely in the cart return.

I have wanted to try Yardbird for some time now, since I have heard a number of good things about this place and the reviews looked amazing.  So, on Sunday we ended up celebrating my friends birthday party here.  Upon being seated, I was never asked what type of table was required of my party, I was simply escorted to a high top table in the back.  Which would not have worked for a pregnant woman and a person with a baby.  Nonetheless, they did change our table to a flat top table in the corner, with not a lot of room.  

In regards to the food, the food was okay.  My friends ordered two appetizers, which were the bourbon glazed donuts, and biscuits.  According to my friends, the donuts and biscuits were delicious.  I ordered the chicken and waffles, my friends ordered an open face omelet,  deviled eggs, fried green tomato, and the shrimp n' grits.  I enjoyed my chicken and waffle minus the watermelon salad ( I only removed the watermelon because I do not like it) however, the presentation was nice.  My one friend had to return her shrimp n' grits as it has a sour taste to it and she was not pleased with the dish.  My other friends loved their food and the presentation of their food.

Their service was okay.  We had to continually ask for refills of water and coffee.  Our server rarely checked in on our party, so we had to flag down another waiter for assistance.

You should not be worried about being cold if you get seated in the outdoor area.

I love that this place serves foods and drinks that are totally out of the norm for the Phoenix area.  I had never had Scandinavian food prior to this (unless you count the IKEA cafeteria? which, no, you probably don't count that) and I was excited to try something new.

Being new to this cuisine, I decided to try the Scandinavian sampler plate for $20 so I could get a little taste of everything.  It comes with 3 meats, 1 side, and 3 salads.  I liked the cured salmon, but it was a little strange to have it just by itself since it was so salty. I felt it needed some bland potatoes or bread to balance it out.  The meatballs were my favorite meat.  The plate also came with gnocchi, which was my favorite part of the meal!  Comfort food at its best.

My least favorite part of the meal was the beet salad.  From the pictures in the menu I thought the beet salad would just be big chunks of beets with a sprinkling of cheese.  What came out was little chunks of beets mixed in with a cream (maybe mayo?).  I don't really care for mayo and the ""salad"" ended up being hot pink, which I know is due to the beet color but was just a little off-putting for my tastes.

My dining companion got the elk stew, which I tried a bite of.  It was really yummy and filling.  His dish also came with a tomato salad that was incredibly good!  I don't know where they get their tomatoes, but they are so flavorful and not like the lame bland tomatoes you get at the grocery store.

When we last ate here there was a bit of food crud on both my menu and Diane's plate.  Ugh!  And, the first pizza that came out was unidentifiable because of excess charring on top.  A gnat also hovered above it for one pass.  So I sent this pizza back, and we later learned that it was Diane's Quattro Formaggio Pizza with Applewood Smoked Bacon and extra cheese.  Its replacement was much better prepared, and no insect accompanied it from the kitchen to the table.

A half order of Caesar Salad with green and light Romaine leaves, rectangles of Mozzarella, a creamy Caesar Dressing, and added grated Parmesan Cheese was excellent.  And, my New York pizza, which was half White Truffle and half Big Apple, was also delicious, although the White Truffle half was heavy on garlic and Truffle Oil flavor.  This pizza was slightly greasy in a good way.  And, the sausage employed in the Big Apple half was excellent: mild with just a little kick.

Diane said she would have preferred less San Marzano Tomatoes inside her pizza.  But the slices looked fine to me.

We were personally served by manager Michelle, who was very friendly and accommodating.  When the bill arrived, two root beers were missing at first.  After I pointed out this omission and a revised bill was presented, we were charged just another $3.00 apiece, which was a great deal since we had been bestowed with a pitcher of root beer with unlimited refills.

I recently price shopped transmission fluid exchange for my 2006 Honda Element, and I was surprised that the dealer was competitively priced with independent shops. Concerned about the shops using the wrong fluid type or similar transmission issues, and that I had two outstanding recall items, I took my vehicle to Honda West with an appointment. The service from Karla was great, informative, and spot on. My car was serviced and completed prior to my estimated completion times. 

My only concern that I need to address is that they advertise on their signage when you pull up $39 Synthetic Oil change, but I noticed my service tag was for 3K miles with standard oil.",2017-03-17 15:48:33

They also force you to pay more for seperate flavors and again when you consider what your getting and who your getting it from it really is NOT worth it.

Once again I went back today cause there really is no substitute if you want a variety of wing flavors, ordered ahead to sit and watch  my food get cold as I stood there while 3 servers wandered aimlessly by me. Then after paying for my cold food I literally had to ask for it after the server finally handed me my receipt... I get home and find that the honey BBQ sauce I ordered is indeed Honey GARLIC.

The meats were decent, but I've had better. Some of their cuts were way too salty for my taste. But for Vegas, I guess it's not a bad place to go. Something different from your normal buffets. 

I wasn't happy with their service though. They were really slow in coming by with each meat. The servers seemed too lazy to walk around our table to serve, instead, they had us clumsily pass each other each slices, which was annoying.

My friend and I ordered the fried chicken, buttermilk biscuits, and the BLT. My favorite dish was the BLT because of the crunch factor from the fried tomato while also retaining the sweet juiciness on the inside. Just wanna say that I normally only eat tomato if it is diced or in a burger, but I would order the BLT again. The bacon was on point as well. The fried chicken was pretty good in terms of crunch and flavor, but way overpriced for the amount you get and for what it is. There wasn't a wow factor or a unique take on the dish. Glad that we opted for just the fried chicken and not the special dish that comes with fried chicken, waffles, and a few pieces of watermelon for like $35. The biscuits were really tasty with the butter and jam that they give you, but again not worth paying $7 for 4 pieces.

Overall, the meal was really good and I would recommend this place if you haven't been here yet. The prices do reflect the fact that it is a restaurant on the strip, but it would be nice if they did some special takes on their dishes to justify the price. I can't help but think that the food I can order here can be bought at a much cheaper price elsewhere and still taste just as good.",2017-11-20 21:47:58

White reliefs with golden accents on the wall, rustic wooden tables, blue walls, marble tiles - Souk Tabule`s decor is an exquisite work of art. 

I have visited Souk Tabule multiple times, hence this extremely long review. Below are dishes we have tried over the course of several months. The food is relatively consistent with a few hits and misses. My go to are the chef`s sampler and falafel. At the risk of boring you, below is the list of items we have tried. 

Appetizers: 
Chef's Sampler ($16) consists of Babaganouj, labni, muhamara, beet mutable, quinoa tabule, and arabic slaw! All wonderful! My favourite is the beet mutable -  Beets, tahini, lemon, garlic! Yum! Bonus points of fresh gluten free saj (flat bread) that does not taste like gluten free bread. 

Saj with Za'atar ($4.50) consists of Dried thyme, oregano, sumac, sesame seeds, and olive oil. You can't go wrong with crispy herbaceous saj!

Mains:
Beirut Pulled Chicken ($13.00) consists of slow-roasted turmeric pulled chicken, served over dirty rice with ground beef, and cinnamon, and topped with Arabic slaw. Overall the dish is on the slightly on the drier end. 

Beiruti falafel ($7.00) in a saj pita, stuffed with Arabic slaw, tomato concasse, pickled turnip and tahini. Comes with three falafel. The falafel seems smaller than before for some odd reason. Regardless, I usually asked to the wrap to be open or without the wrap. I find it a lot more enjoyable! It is a great salad hack at Souk. 

Shashuka ($12) with roasted tomato and red pepper sauce with three local free run omega 3 soft-cooked eggs and a scoop of labni. The dish is great for a morning brunch. Perfect for sharing.  

Shish Tawuk ($13.00) with Ontario farm fresh chicken breast, grilled and served over turmeric rice and topped with Arabic slaw. Again, the chicken is dried and the portion of chicken is on the smaller end. 

Sides:
Phoenician fries ($5.50) with za'atar and drizzled in tahini. Dry seems to be the theme of some of the item on the miss list. Save the calories for something more delicious!

Mujaddara ($4.50) rice with lentil. Again, slightly dried. 

Vegan lentil soup ($5.50) with pureed red lentils, carrots, celery no cream or butter. Nothing to write home about.

Desserts:
Coconut cookies ($2.50) made with egg white and shredded coconut. A little too sweet for my liking! 

Drinks:
Avoid juices ($5.5) at all cost. Ever since they switched vendor, juices resembles toilet water. 

Moroccan Mint ($2.95) comes in a decorative tea pot and miniature tea cups. Great for sharing!

Honey Cardamon Latte ($4.75) is a hug in a cap. Warm creamy latte with honey and cardamon goodness. This latte is a crowd pleaser! 

Overall, Souk is a good option if you are in the neighborhood! Food is always fresh. Pita is made to order. Remember, for a good time, avoid their juices! Go for a nice scroll by the Make Peace exhibit after brunch, lunch or dinner!",2017-08-08 20:09:09

-------------------------
Hey! An Indian restaurant in central Phoenix! How about that? Awesome, right?

Um. Don't get too excited, O.

I get seated in a booth by the front door and survey the scene. Groups and dates of people eating. Flat screen panel showing a sequence of 2006's most craptastic Bollywood videos. Bar stocked with Johnny Walker Black Label, because if you're Indian, that's what you drink. Mango lassi is for wusses.

I order ground chicken samosas, boneless chicken kebabs, and lamb vindaloo with rice, naan, and raita. Complementary papadum and chutney is placed on my table. Soon after 4 dinky samosas arrive on a small plate. They were ok. Meh is more like it.

Then I wait a LONG time (20+ minutes) for my entrees. I know grilling chicken takes a while, but these were small boneless pieces - I know it's not supposed to take longer than 4 music videos of Indian hero boy and Indian heroine girl disco dancing in the forest and then all of a sudden a rainstorm and her sari is wet....

....where was I? Oh yeah. People who came in and ordered 10-15 mintes after I did received their food within 8-10 minutes. That kind of annoyed me. I seethed a little, but only to myself, because I'm suave like that.

Eventually my dinner shows up. Chicken pieces in a sizzling platter. Vindaloo served in an antique metal bowl. Good on the presentation, I'll give them that.

The naan was crisp, which is a good plus, because the divine whomevers ruling the universe will strike upon those, the evil misguided purveyors of the Earth's soggy, limp naans. Oh, they will be struck down, mark my words. 

The chicken, for it taking so long, was very tender and juicy but really mediocre tasting. Mediocre to the point where I recognized the jarred tandoori sauce they marinated the chicken in. So not good to do, my Indian restaurantering friends. 

The vindaloo was alright...but with really small cubes of lamb and potatoes. I asked for them to make all of my food really spicy, because, well, I'm brown like they are and that's how we roll. But they took it as to make it as bland as possible. Maybe they thought I was an 87-year old English man named Alistair for whom even a sprinkle of crushed black pepper would set his mouth on fire. Who knows.

What I do know is that I was disappointed something huge. An Indian restaurant so close to where I live, and yet so debatable whether if I'm ever going to go back.

So two stars (maybe a little greater than two, like two-and-a-third) for the Indian food and Indian service equivalent of  beige. Decent ambiance and friendly host-owner, though, so hey, if you're in the 'hood and are hankering for some curried meh, you've got your ideal place right here.

VJGQZrQsuf6gzQ9t0_ccvw,Kan41cWJccXV2MGPfWoIDw,e6UDJBEIoXBbnXtdwkqIGA,3,0,0,0,"When I was in Taiwan, this restaurant chain was everywhere like a McDonald's. 

It's main dish is a large half chicken (or something close to that) bone in, deep fried chicken served in a paper wrapper. 

Its a lot tastier then I'm describing it, and was quite addictive eating it at all the different night markets in Taipei. Closest comparison I can think of is a very large KFC, but with a lot less grease and a lot cheaper.

When I heard that there was an official restaurant in Toronto I had to come here to give it a try.

It's very close to how it is in Taipei, but doesn't quite do the original justice. The batter and chicken seemed to be a bit greasier and was falling off the meat a bit. So it did make it messier to eat. The chicken itself was juicy, and towards the bottom was the signature bone.

The reason why they make this chicken bone in is because they claim that it helps retain its moisture and makes it juicy, not sure how true that is though. Just an fyi for the other reviewers complaining about it.

Taste wise, and the entire meal is pretty bang on with Taipei. So if you don't enjoy eating this at all, dont bother having it in Taipei. But if you felt this was pretty good, but has room for improvement, you definitely need to try this in Taipei.

The place is quite small with a bunch of random tables people pull together. On a Friday night it was quite busy and mainly filled with university students it seemed.

A cheap meaty meal at $10 or so, pretty good deal compared to KFC. 

Make sure to grab a knife and fork and sit down to eat this, then the bone at the end won't be so bad.",2017-03-29 13:22:33

I was so glad when the new owners took over and I was one of their first customers. I loved it. I even held a large party for my job there and rented the entire salon. I have been a consistent, good and loyal customer. However, that being said, I went back recently for a scheduled appt. at 2pm. I arrived 15 mins early so I could choose my colors and designs. By the time it was two minutes to two, I asked if my appt was going to be on time, since the guy David I was seeing was still way involved in another customers work. He appeared to be about halfway through the process. This is the reason I booked my appt. so I did not have to wait.  I was told very rudely by the salon manager Victoria ""well you are early""... and I said yes, its now two minutes until my time and he looks iike he is going to be awhile. She argued with me in front of several customers which was completely rude and uncalled for. Unappreciated. Sometimes people get a little too big for their britches..........you are a nail technician......not a CEO of a major corporation. You are in the business of customer service. When a customer calls way ahead of time, hours before and makes an appt. you should be seen at the appt. time. My technician was about 15 minutes from being finished with his ""walk in client"". I should have been told this instead of being treated like my expectation of being seen on time was a burden. I have literally sent tons of customers to this salon. Friends, family, co-workers. I feel they are so busy now that they have obviously forgotten why they became successful in the first place. The last few times I have been here, I have been hurried through, and the pedicures have been hastily done. Very expensive for what you get. No personal touch as before. Not going back. Ever.

Maybe this is for the snooty eaters out there - because this place was awful to us. It was 2/3 empty and we get asked if we have a reservation - No, just walk ins... so they sit us right next tot he kitchen by where the waiters come in and out - easily the worst table in the restaurant, and they weren't even busy. 

So, I haven't even noticed this when we order a calamari appetizer, which was recommended by apparent not very familiar with good food blogger Jaymee Sire (http://eisforeat.blogspot.com/2012/02/t-is-for-tommy-vs-and-other-scottsdale.html)  I went with 2/4 of what she said to have - the chicken parm and the calamari. The calamari were terrible - I mean, what do we expect, fresh fish in Arizona must be something of an oxymoron... 

So this is where things get interesting - the waiter asks us how our rubbery, tasteless calamari is - I being one who doesn't like to send food back tried to hide the truth, but the look on my dad's face was as if his only son came home to say he got an Al Qaeda male general pregnant and they weren't getting married... So the waiter grabs the plate before we can say anything to have them make another batch.. which we didn't want, and shocker, the second batch was even worse... 

So at this point dad is furious, and yells at me for eating enough of the bad calamari creepy crawlers (the ones with tentacles are my favorite) so that he can't bitch at the waiter about how bad it was when he comes back. 

The waiter takes away the app and comes back with the entrees - now we had ordered a pasta to share and two entrees, thinking he would brought them out for a pasta course then the main dishes - but it all came out at once. As he places the food down, Dad tells the waiter ""I've been punished before, it's OK, I get it,"" and I am part rolling my eyes part trying not to laugh. 

That this waiter has looked us up and down as a couple of country bumpkins not realizing my dad is normally a 20-30% tipper, especially when on vacation with a roll of dough in his pocket. So then, to add insult to injury, this Artie Bucco wannabe comes back to check on how the entrees are then quips ""So I don't have to take these back? Enjoy!"" 

Well - Self Fulfilling prophecy jerk-wad - I would be nicer to customers based on how mediocre your food was - I am a Chicken Parmesan SLUT - I ate maybe 2/3 of it. The pasta bolognese? MEH... Dad unfortunately ordered fish for his main dish, which was again NOT fresh, so he pretty much at all the rest of the pasta t the table. 

I will never go back here - give me the Italian Grotto every day, where the food is better, the servers have personality, and the food is amazing - strange how THEIR calamari tastes fresh...

We just ate here today, after a small family get-together - one of our kids has a real addiction to poké and sushi, and she begged us to take her here.

The space is small and informal, just what you would want for a no-frills poké stop. Everything is clean and spotless - the counters, tables, and even the restrooms are all spic and span, which is exactly as a place like this should be. Staff was friendly, and knew their recipes for the signature bowls by heart, without having to keep checking the signs. You can make your own as well, but we figured that signature bowls on the first visit would be representative of their own vision for the place. They did not disappoint! They had some reggae playing in the background, and I am sure that if we had been there a little longer, Don Ho would have been crooning in short order.

I had their Big Island Classic bowl (tuna, white rice, hijiki, cucumber, sweet onion, scallions, and ""Kahuna sauce"" - just a touch of spiciness) and really enjoyed it. It took me back to a memory of our last trip to the Big Island, when we went off the beaten path, to a little place in Hawi, where I had first had poke. Great times.

The kids split a Ponzu Salmon bowl, and loved it - this one doesn't have any heat to it, and it's cool and refreshing. Loved the way the wonton chips and edamame mixed with the tasty salmon and ponzu sauce. This was another home run!

There are other options as well - check out their menu. You can even build your own poké bowl, customizing all of the components to your liking. They have a number of juices / drinks as well if that is your thing - we decided upon their ""Big Red"" juice (beets, carrots, and some other good stuff) and their ""Orange Crush"" juice for this time - it's Lent, and we have beer and wine on hold for now...

I arrived about 10 minutes before she did, so I put my name on the Wait List and tucked myself in the corner of the foyer as it was pretty busy.

The DJ was on the bar side and it was L O U D. So loud, it made me wince, to be honest. Because DJ was so loud, the patrons had to talk loudly to hear themselves so it was just sort of stressful. I was adamant about NOT sitting to the right (bar side).

I dunno... I guess this (DJ Pauly-dude spinning vinyl) feels more natural at a restaurant in the bowels of Old Town, not North Scottsdale. Someplace like R&R, or Geisha-A-Go-Go...? You know??

The hostess/other lady (maybe owner?) kept asking me if my party of 2 wld like to sit at the bar (multiple times). I kept repeating to them I didn't want to because it's too loud and I wanted to visit w/my friend. Very annoying.

My friend and I did get seated to the left side of the restaurant and it was much quieter. 

Our server (didn't catch name) was great! I ordered one of his recommendations (Pork Carnitas Hash Skillet w/2 corn tortillas) and was glad, as it was pretty tasty.

I am too lazy to drive to another wonton noodle place so i decided to try Jyuban.  It was a pretty chill place with some old Japanese song playing in the background.  The place was extremely clean as how it always is in a Japanese noodle place.  I decided to try to spicy bbq pork noodle.  The waitress was really friendly and advised me to just try the first level of spiciness as there are three levels.  

I waited for more than 20 minutes for my noodles when only seven other people in the restaurant.  I thought the wait was a little bit too long, but I can definitely live with that.  along came, my bbq pork ramen noodle with pork bone soup I think.  I thought the soup was a little blant and the thickness of the noodle is a little thicker than I liked.  However, I really like the fact that they don't place msg in the soup place.  She kind of gave me the salt a little too late as I was half way thru my noodle already.  I guess it is something new I learned eating at a no msg and low sodium place.  I have a asked for the salt.  It happened to me last time when i was eating at a really high class restaurant.  I thought all their food were under salted.  Might be the trend of healthy diet i guess.  

But man, was the ramen spicy, but it is a weird kind of spiciness where it only hit the back of my throat.  This is not the kind of spiciness I enjoyed.  Oh well, the cha siu (bbq prok) was large in portions.  There were three HUGE pieces, and I really like that.  The soup base was a little thin though.  Overall, the ramen was pretty good with good customer service.  I would come back again, maybe try their rice dishes since I don't likr their hand made ramen that much.

The second time we went there we had a party of 14 which is brave to take to any restaurant but I wanted to try them out to see if they can handle it. And they did with flying colors.

Although it was dinner I did opt for more of a lunch style menu item which was a fried chicken sandwich. This is either really easy to do well or really easy to screw up and they did it exceptionally well. The bun seem like an egg style bun but was a little fluffy or too big for my taste. So the bun was nothing like a Chick-fil-A style Bond but was more Artisan than anything. The chicken breast seem to be close to six oz which is kind of big surf or sandwich but I did not complain one bit LOL. It came with a side of fries which were freshly cut from what I can tell and there was an ample generous serving of fries but nothing crowding the plate.

100 mile round trip just to visit this small restaurant ... You Betcha!

This time we met our friend Mike there, solo at the Sushi Bar when we arrived.
It's Wednesday and the pace is much slower, but not for Mimi & Kay as they are the only feet on the floor. 

We ordered ""Omakasi"" (This means the chef decides)

Mimi paraded plate after plate of fresh Nigiri Sushi, most did not require any additional dipping. Nice! There is no doubt about it, the quality of the fish at this location is giant step above the other Takamatsu's and any of those ""all you can eat"" Sushi joints in town. Pricing is very reasonable.

We also ordered a Kalbi to share, very tasty, as were all the Banchan side dishes. Mimi informed us she works daily and besides running the Sushi Bar she is responsible for kitchen prep and yes she makes the Banchan. ""No time for a boyfriend.""

She didnt repeat the order, but said the total amount and took our card. it took about ten mins to get two smoothies, a kids cheese quesadilla and chicken Cesar salad. The girl apologize for the wait but that's all she said. We were hoping the food was fresh since it took so long but that wasn't true.

My current favorite is the Sweet n Salty - perfectly moist caramel cake with a caramel salt, cream cheese frosting and Himalayan salt on top. Oh Em Gee!!! The Pina Colada is yummy too.

I only wish I had found it a few months earlier so I could have picked the apples, peaches and pears in season. 

So here is the deal:
60 acres of crops: apples, peaches, pears, figs, plums, Arugala, Asparagus, Beets, Bok Choy, Carrots, Corn, Cucumbers, Eggplant, Garlic, Kale, Leeks, Melons, Onions, Peas, Potatoes, Pumpkins, Radishes, Squash, Sweet, Potatoes ,Tomatoes ,Zucchini
Check the website for info on what's available seasonally http://www.thegilcreaseorchard.org/

Hours: Seasonal so check the website
wagons are available to haul your stash as you make your way up and down the rows of crops.

This place is one of my new Vegas favorites! So thrilled I can spend a morning picking my own veggies! I definitely suggest going early to avoid the heat and crowds. 
In October you can expect to find cider, doughnuts, & hayrides too. Definitely a fun and different way to spend a day in Vegas.",2013-10-30 20:09:32

It's in the trendy Tivoli Square which looks brand new and is stylishly done.  The walls, decorations, art and overall feel screams Italian countryside, complemented by the bright Vegas sun outside.  

We ordered one of the chicken sandwiches with the housemade chips, the mezzo chicken ""under the brick"", the grilled chicken risotto with sweet potatoes and I had the grilled shrimp with orzo.  Everything was good.  Nothing the blew us away.  The food is noticeably rich with butter and salt (fair warning for those looking for lighter, healthier choices) and is served in smallish portions perfect for lunch.  My family really enjoyed the housemade chips which were not salty at all and perfectly crisp.  

This place might have gotten an extra star if the service had been a little bit more personable and organized.  The waitress was friendly but she came back after our order and handed me a Caesar salad.  I looked back at her in confusion.  ""I didn't order a salad.""  ""Yes, you did.  This is yours.""  My aunt spoke up and said it was hers and she apologized but if I told her I didn't order it, I thought that should have been it.  

By the time we started eating, my mother still didn't have her side salad.  The waitress told us it would be right out.  After she'd brought it out, Mom said the girl dropped it on the table and said ""here you are"" while already looking to the next table and moving on.  Since she believes that service includes making eye contact with your customers when you are engaging with them, I'm mentioning it here.

They had a great line up of musical acts and other vendors among food, jewelry, dog adoption and more. And they had fair food--who doesn't love fair food?? 

You could bring your own chairs (and coolers), find a spot to relax in, buy a bottle of wine and take in the atmosphere. I visited most of the wineries and they were very friendly, informative about the taste of their wines, how its made and what the taste was like. You go could to each tent and get a sample but most places had $5 for a full glass and pretty sweet bottle specials.

We were worried there would be a huge wait, but it only took a couple of minutes to get seated.  

We were pretty hungry so once we were seated we ordered both onion rings and fried pickles.  I've never had fried pickles and while they were tasty, I don't think its something I would order again.  I liked the crunchy onion rings...just lamented that there were so many!  The food runner who brought them out proudly announced that he tried to stack them as high as they could.  Really though?  It was LOT and there were only 3 of us!  

I had to decide whether I wanted to drink my calories or eat them, and I decided in favor of chewing versus sipping.  I passed on the adult milkshakes, though many of them looked tempting.  I ordered the fun-ghi burger which was really delicious.  Piping hot burger, with yummy mushrooms and cheese.  It was a great combination.  Everyone else at the table enjoyed their burgers as well.  I ordered sweet potato fries with this burger, but seriously?  Who could eat that when the burgers filled you up!

We had a coupon for a free nacho skillet so we used that to get us started with Thai Chicken Nachos ($8.95). Chicken, Veggies, sweet chili sauce, queso with peanuts and sesame seeds  are piled high on tortilla chips. It's kind of hard to eat without having the tower of nachos topple over and fall onto the table. I wished the skillet was oversized to accommodate fallen chips. The menu advertises these to be spicy hot. They weren't not. There was a mild sweet heat, but definitely not spicy nor hot. That was disappointing. 

Moving onto entrees, our party of three tried the carne asada big daddy burrito ($13.95), fajita cheesesteak sandwich ($10.95) and street tacos ($2.95 ea).  All was edible, though, none was notable. We felt each dish was overpriced for quality of what was presented.

No wait time, but the restaurant was fairly filled up, the tables are huge!  I've always wanted to try something like this since my dad sent me videos of these steaming pot places from China.

I must say the service at the table here is phenomenal, they are always checking up to make sure everything is okay, but of course because they need to cook the food for you.
I walked in with the mindset that it would be mandarin people, but they're actually cantonese, and english is great too!

We ordered Combo A, the seafood was very fresh and in a good portion.  The chicken that came with our combo was average, not too much taste but maybe because it's steamed.  I would definitely come back to the place, but not often, and the only reason I'm rating it 4 stars, is because it's quite expensive.

They didn't take reservations for tonight, so it was 1st come 1st serve. My family comes from northern China, so a lot of the menu options felt pretty nostalgic... until the actual food came. Typical Chinese restaurant food, i.e. very greasy, cornstarch-y, and salt-loaded. We asked for no MSG, but certain dishes like cold noodles must come with MSG due to the pre-packaged sauce. The food definitely felt more authentic than Chinatown options, but I was disappointed by the lack of truly vegetarian options (watch out for meat slices in their veggie stir fries) and the copious amount of oil.

Overall-

Food 3/5 - Taste was a times bland (i.e. the okra dish) or overcompensated by the taste of salt or spice. Unhealthy for sure. Decent portion sizes for the mains, but small serving sizes for desserts. Nothing special - I thought my family's home cooking could probably beat many of their dishes. Their Peking duck is supposed to be very famous, but we didn't order it tonight. 
Value 4/5 - Not bad, e.g. $8.99 for many dishes. Family-style, would recommend ordering many dishes and sharing. Unsure if this is true for everybody, but we had to order rice/carbs separately as rice didn't come with the vegetarian dishes. 
Service 4/5 - Friendly servers, but they're really busy, so infrequent service. Food takes 5-15 mins to arrive.
Venue 5/5 - Large (but not large enough since HUGE long line clogging the entrance at all times) and clean. Classy looking chandliers. Clean and modern washrooms. Really loud and chaotic since many large groups and families come here.",2017-01-03 05:07:26

They offer a wide range of colors, however (at least when I went) all of the gel colors are in white bottles so you can't see the color unless you open it. They don't have any of the sample nail colors laying around. I found this frustrating that I finally gave up and just picked a color.

It's in the center, so there are tons of choices for fun. Next door are the Miracle Mile Shops & Planet Hollywood, across the street is the new Cosmopolitan, Aria, & the rest of City Center, attached is Bally's & the tram station, and cab rides anywhere else on The Strip (necessary in stilettos!) are short & inexpensive.

The rooms are not overly lavish like some of the newer super hotels, but not bad either. The beds are comfortable (although they're stingy with the amount of pillows!) and the bathrooms are fine.

The pool is cool in the summer, especially with the magnificent view of the Eiffel Tower replica right there!

There's also a good amount of choices when you need some food to soak up the booze and/or cure a hangover.

The chicken roti was very delicious with fresh tasting wrap.  My only comment would be that it was not as spicy as i normally like it to be. I drenched it with the hot sauce at the table but still wished it was hotter.  The jerk pork was also very delicious along with all the sides but this could also have been more spicy.

As the evening progressed, we found out that it was karaoke night.  There were a bunch of regulars that sing every thursday apparently. It was very lively and entertaining. 

They have a large bar and the drinks were very reasonable.  Later at night they had a drink menu with drinks priced from $6-$7..all very reasonable.

We saw the other tables order Jerk wings that looked delish. I was tempted to reach over and grab a drumstick.

Overall the atmosphere was good - laid back, casual, and relaxing (the hockey game was playing on a tv in the back), the service was good - although they could have been more attentive to take drink orders, the food was authentically de-li-cious, and the bill was reasonable - $75 for 3 meals and 6 drinks.

As my eyes flitted between the glass-encased pastries, breakfast menu, mostly raw dessert window, black board, and other people's plates, I got the anxious-excited onset of knowing that I was about to eat a LOT of food. 

Here's what I had the pleasure of tasting (and have been craving all day... if only they were open on Mondays *le sigh*):

The breakfast burrito was awesome for a number of reasons. First, the actual wrap looks and tastes homemade... none of that grocery store tortilla debauchery. Second, there are sweet potatoes inside. Orange morsels of joy, if you will. Finally, you get to choose egg or tofu, and vegan or regular cheese. Customizable. Food. Rocks. We also had Strawberry Rhubarb French Toast... sounds amazing already, right? What that name doesn't reveal, however, is that it's made from griddled banana bread. Grilled, crunchy-edged, banana-y, rhubarb jam-smothered, fresh fruit and vegan whipped cream topped heaven. If you're not salivating after reading that, just get out of here.

For dessert, the raw tiramisu took the cake. Or took the tiramisu. Whatever. Either way, I will never miss, desire, or crave ""classic"" tiramisu again. I've been converted... enlightened, rather. The raw Snickers bar was admirable, but dare I say the cashew caramel layer was too sweet for my tastes? Not that that prevented my finishing it.. it didn't. Overall though, 'twas was a bit much. And, if you're tentative to venture into the raw dessert world (wimp), you can't go wrong with a cowgirl cookie.

... And if that's too high a word count to process, just take away this message: Go to Pomegranate. Order a variety of things. It's a place of wonders. You shan't regret it.",2012-04-03 04:22:26

m-e1qpkxLNk60DSfNbz0cA,4r33dXcE1oYZxjONrhxTiA,9gNko6cFCMZbvy1zhJ7-Xg,4,2,1,1,"My wife and I ate at Fukuda for the first time last night after reading rave reviews on several sites and reading the local paper's initial impression - we like to seek out small new restaurants and enjoy them while they are starting up; it's fun to become a regular in a new restaurant that is working hard to excel.

First - Space - the restaurant is small and intimate. They have some asian accents, but it's a really relaxed place to eat. The ceilings are high, and this makes for a low noise level inside, even when the place was packed. The ambient music is not overwhelming, and accentuates the intimate environment without being a distraction. My only ""suggestion for improvement"" would be for them to elevate the acrylic light boxes' position over the tables for two - they are pretty much protruding out of the walls at face-level and are somewhat of a distraction - they made it hard to peer into my wife's beautiful eyes during the meal... Another reviewer seems to agree with me on this.

Second - Service - the staff are incredibly friendly and hospitable. Even though they do not shout the typical Japanese ""Irasshaimasen!"" when you walk in the door (that would definitely not fit in with the overall feel of this place anyways), you feel immediately welcomed and it's easy to all of a sudden start up a nice conversation with this nice group of people trying to express their vision. We did not have the issues with service that other reviewers had during our visit - service was attentive but not overbearing, flighty, or careless for us.

Third - Food - the food is spectacular. All of our food came promptly, at the correct temperature, and beautifully presented. As other reviewers here indicate, the quality of ingredients here is first class all the way - they definitely aren't compromising in their selection of fish or anything else in order to get their restaurant up and running. This is probably why the sampler runs $38 and leaves one wanting more. Of course, the true experience in sushi is in quality and not quantity, so we gladly ordered several other items on the menu (I think we hit about 75% of that evening's non-sushi items, which turned out to be a great experience!) 

Despite the focus on Chef Matt's delicious and high-quality sushi, I would say that the first time customer should definitely take advantage of ordering LOTS of different robatayaki and appetizer-style dishes, and have a few select sushi items. The back kitchen is highly adept at providing an incredible izakaya-style experience with these dishes, and honestly, I was a little sad we had brought only sake with us, as some namachus (draft beers) would really have hit the spot. We had the takoyaki (we liked it so much, we ordered it twice during the meal...), the cold sliced duck breast, the tofu (amazing... I have never ordered tofu in a restaurant before, and from now on, will have it every time at Fukuda while they serve it... It's that awesome), the shiitake robatayaki, the yakitori (chicken skewers), and their grilled edamame (who would have thought simple soybeans in the pod could be so mind-blowing? I've always found edamame to be OK, but this was delicious...)

We liked the idea of their changing menu, and would definitely love to see even more of their vision the next time we visit, which I honestly think will not be too terribly far in our future. Best of luck guys!",2013-01-04 22:48:37

The BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos was clearly the favorite between Mr. B and I, plus our friends that attended the Yelp event we went to here ..  http://www.yelp.com/biz/elite-event-nacho-average-rebel-yelp-party-las-vegas#hrid:1Q2Udxc1HbALhrj26tTD7w.  So here we are back again for more and to try out their other entrees.

This time around we ordered the Carne Asada Burrito Chimichanga style (deep fried), BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos and my entree I had the Fajita Tofu Salad! ...Yes, you read it right.. Tofu! I'm  NOT Vegetarian nor Vegan, but Ive cut down on my red meat intake. So restaurants that have a pretty good entree selections that cater to Vegetarians are good in my book. I thoroughly enjoyed having my salad, The balsamic dressing was tossed evenly throughout, veggies were crisp and fresh and texture for tofu was just right for this salad. The vegetarian/vegan selections are not listed on the main menu they hand out but it is noted on there that you have to request it. 

Carne Asada Burrito was what's on Mr. B.'s plate...or what took up alot of his table area. This entree was absolutely massive! Aye Aye Aye! Plan to be really hungry if you order this. I didn't get a chance to try it (Lent no red meat Wed/Fri dealie) but Mr. B kept going on and on how real flavorful the grilled meat was and it was ""so good!""

Glad we ordered the BBQ Pork Nachos again.  Pulled pork tender, just enough bbq sauce, love the homemade tortilla chips and the onion strings that topped it really pulled this unique nacho platter together.  We got the personal sized  plate instead of entree sized one. The personal sized one was plenty enough to be shared between two people. Especially when you are ordering other plates of food.  That's not hard to do here either. Alot of choices other than Nachos.The table across from us ordered Fajitas. I heard it sizzle and got a whiff of it when their server walked it past us.That'll be next I'll have to try. 

We saw Chef Mike again and sampled the green and red sauces he makes for the enchiladas.  Both were very good, but the green sauce was both our picks.   More savory with just the perfect amount of heat! Love it!!!! That's another entree added on our ""to try"" list. 

I really like how everything we've tried so far is made in house. Alot fresher tasting.

Oh, forgot to mention the complimentary corn muffins that they serve up. Fresh kernels of corn with diced jalapenos baked right in too. Oooh yum! 

Service was great! From our hostess that greeted and seated us right away, to our friendly server who had good timing on checking up on us, drinks filled etc.   Love the casual vibe going on in the dining area.  The decor is tastefully done. They have 3 large TV's that you can view from where you are sitting. You have your choice  between booths, tables or dining out in the covered patio for your seating arrangement. The large windows that surround half the dining area look out to the Vegas valley.  Also they have a separate room that you can book your meeting or event at. Then of course the bar area is on the left side that section is separated by the foyer when you enter the place. Pretty decent size too with seating up at bar and high top table/chairs throughout and a covered patio on this side as well.
   
Happy Hour specials menu is tempting, so are the Taco Tuesdays I read in the tip section, and Mondays I read kids eat free??? Whoa!! So family friendly. This alone is  rated mucho stars worthy!

I headed over early to snag a table. Unfortunately, they don't do this unless almost your whole party has arrived (they wanted 3 of 4 people there). So I stood around awkwardly in the entrance area for 10 minutes and watched other people be seated with a whole pile of empty tables behind me. Weird. 

We sat down and were catching up, so when the server came by once and then twice and we hadn't decided what we wanted, she said to just flag her down when we were ready. We took a while longer and then flagged her down, she nodded at us. And then 10 minutes go by and we had to flag her down again. 

I always get the sea queen, it's calamari with a honey lime sauce and rice. Soooo tasty. The calamari is always tender and the sauce is badass. We also got the spring rolls they were huge and quite tasty! 

I know Salad King is a super popular spot but it doesn't hold much appeal for me. I dislike the bench seating they have there, I don't like being shoulder to shoulder with strangers while I eat.

Walking distance from my office in a small shopping center, I was encouraged by the snug seating area and smiling face behind the counter. 

They've got a $5.99 lunch deal, so I ordered the Reuben (it was good, but a little thin on the ingredients) but it turned out that was the 1 sandwich not included on the lunch deal (my fault for not looking at the fine print!). The sandwich did come with a pickle spear and it was nice and crunchy! They have a fountain drink area, as well as bottled drinks and a decent chip selection for sides.

The real negative to this place was that the smiling face behind the counter who took my order, made my sandwich and checked me out told some highly inappropriate jokes along the way. :( Nothing like feeling uncomfortable while you're on your lunch break. I understand that with little places people's personalities shine through and it should be part of the appeal, but sexual innuendos and creepy jokes just don't fly with a customer who you've never met and who let you know this was her first time in.

The region is pretty big, so this restaurant can sell anything from the cusines of Shanghai to Hakka to Dong Jiang and more.

My mom loved the salted duck.  It was flavourful, lean and not dry.  The pork belly had a nice ruby colour.  The fat was a tiny bit less than melt in the mouth, but it was pretty good.  The lean meat part was outstanding as it was lean yet not ""fiber"" like (瘦而不柴).  I ate the pork and preserved vegetable with the bun, and it was heaven.  It helped that the bun was slightly sweet.

I have already visited and been pleasantly surprised by The Dispensary Lounge and The Badger Café, it was only a matter of time before I visited Sammy's LA Pastrami & Burgers. I've received plenty of comments on the three, and have equally read plenty about them on the internet. So after finally closing out the set, how does Sammy's stack up with the rest?

Sammy's has two locations in town, the aforementioned East Side location, and another on the west side of town also near Tropicana. Both locations are basically small shacks, and I was completely surprised to discover that there was actual seating inside the building for customers. The menu has a large amount of completely unhealthy-sounding items like sandwiches, fries, burgers and hot dogs all with an insane amount of toppings you may not expect or just question how they would all fit. This is definitely not the place to visit if you want just a plain burger and fries, as this is clearly not their approach. Kind of reminded me of Rambo's Kitchen actually.

After much deliberation I decided to go with the steak burger: a single patty topped with ribeye steak, grilled onion, bacon, provolone cheese and steak sauce. What came out was just as expected: huge and messy. For such an insanely complicated burger and toppings, the bun is surprisingly well proportioned. It was grilled and crispy, yet soft and gooey inside and very tasty. The steak had good flavor, but the Worcestershire-like steak sauce became far too overpowering about halfway through. The onions and cheese were ok, but not too noticeable in all of the meat flavors. The bacon was a bit too hard; it had ok flavor but again was lost with everything else. The actual burger patty had very generic beef flavor and was very dry. You're clearly getting this for the novelty and toppings, and not the patty unlike Sammy's two local rivals which really thrived on the quality of their meat. While some people may like a giant, messy burger with too many toppings, I prefer something a little simpler and dare I say, healthier than this offering. While the flavors were all good, it was a bit much.

The garlic romano fries were decent; the heaps of seasonings on my skinny fries were enough to make my hands even filthier than they already were from the overly sloppy burger. They were good for a while, but by the end when they got cold they weren't really the same. And believe me, even the small is more than enough for one person, and if you're eating them with a burger you won't give them the proper attention while you're trying to handle all your toppings.

My next issue is the cost; sure you're getting quite the serving size and an excessive amount of toppings, but my meal came to $14.78 with burger, fries and drink. If you're strictly comparing this to the other two from this grouping, it's more than double the cost and not in the running. Even not comparing this to the other two, I'm not sure if I would pay this much just because there's too much going on for me. Maybe I'm too much of a burger purist? I like a quality burger, not an attraction with insane toppings, and that's exactly what you get here. If you're into extravagant toppings, by all means visit Sammy's, but if you're looking for just a quality burger at an amazing price, either The Dispensary Lounge or The Badger Café are your best bets in this grouping.",2012-11-08 23:41:12

Came here for Sunday lunch. This place was pretty busy but luckily, we didn't have to wait to be seated.
I had spicy wonton and Shang's beef noodle with knife shaved noodle. Both items were amazing!! The beef was so tender and tasty but not salty at all. Knife shaved noodles were different and delicious. 
If you sit at the counter, you can watch the men making hand pulled noodles. I enjoyed watching them make noodles!! Kids would LOVE watching this ;-)
Their water of the day was lemon and cucumber infused water. So refreshing!
The waitress was very nice and gave us super quick service but there was only one waitress working at the time. It was pretty busy so we felt bad asking her for more water or more napkins. Even though this place is small, I felt it was way too much for her to take care of all the tables at lunchtime on Sundays.

My first time watching KA was back in high school--it was also my first Cirque show ever. We had second row center seats, and I remember wanting to join the circus afterwards. I recently watched the show again with my boyfriend for our anniversary and sat a little further back. 

Seats wise, I actually think it's better to sit a little further back because this way you are able to see all the stunts/activity going on in the side towers. When I sat in the front, you had to turn your head around to be able to see what was going on.

I love how interactive and special the stage is. They manage to do so many things with the moving stage. My favorite scene is definitely when they're fighting with the arrows shooting at the 90 degree stage. A lot of the scenes made me hold my breath because I was so anxious. The only scene that is way too slow for me is Love Dance. Otherwise, it's a great great show, and you do get invested in the story and characters!

I ordered for delivery through foodie call and had a custom pizza made of goat cheese, proscuitto, and arugula - my go to. The pizza came within the expected time frame (45 minutes) and I was excited to give it a try.

The first red flag (you can see by the picture) is all the toppings were plopped in the center. Who likes eating their pizza with no toppings on the outside and then mounds of it on the other side? I spent the next 5 minutes redistributing the toppings so it was evenly dispersed throughout the pie. Second, where was the proscuitto?! There were tiny cut up bits of what tasted like ham sprinkled on top, but definitely not the thin slices of salty, savory proscuitto deliciousness I was expecting.

The ancient grain crust, however, was very good and I also enjoyed the brown sugar cinnamon dipping sauce that came with it. I'm willing to give Pure Pizza another try...but I'll surely be there in person to voice my criticisms.",2014-05-28 20:48:30

I was staying nearby and figured it was worth checking out, rather than making the trek towards the strip. I'm glad I put my biases towards macro beer aside, because I actually enjoyed my short visit to this brewery that just so happens to serve food.

The beer here appears to be brewed on site by brewmaster Julio Lanzas. That alone is rare for a restaurant brewery chain. It shows in the final product. They have a few beers that you won't find bottled in your local supermarket.

The Session IPA was surprisingly hoppy and not exactly what most people think of as a sessionable beer at over 5% ABV. Who knew a German brewery could brew such a decent West Coast style beer. No it's not fantastic but for the price and location, there's not much better fresh from the tap.

The IPA was a bit of a miss. It's a bit less balanced than the Session. I didn't taste much hops on this one. It was what I would expect from GB. Especially after trying the smooth hoppy Session immediately before it.   

The Stout was a thick, delicious, slightly stronger version of an Irish Stout. A mix of Imperial and Irish perhaps? 

I was pleasantly surprised with their Belgian Tripel. I'm not normally a fan of the Belgian stuff but this was an incredibly well done take on this style. Kudos to the brewmaster on this one. 

I like how they have several different size glasses to choose from at reasonable price differences. I rolled with the pint size since I wanted to try several different beers during one visit, but you can go all the the way up to 23.some odd ounce glass if you're feelin' randy. 

The service was great. The bald bartender was on top of it with me and all the other customers at the bar. He is definitely an asset to this business.  

Actually after visiting the strip, I appreciate this place that much more. It's not overpriced, the beer is decent, with a variety of styles and great customer service. Other brewpubs could use a lesson from this place.",2016-04-13 14:53:13

An amazing friend got us on the guest list with free passes and drink wristbands for a couple hours. Like most of the hot clubs it's better to get to Marquee early. 

I will say that as a couple of white girls we were definitely the minority. But that made no difference, One floor was old school rap/hip hop (my favorite), another floor was packed with house music connecting with the pool deck, and the last floor (the library) is a great place to grab a drink, chill and play pool. We didn't stay that long since we were meeting up with people. But then later I went back, skipped the lines (don't know how much that cost) and danced the night away with my date until 4 a.m. Almost missed my flight but it would have been worth it.

I've bowled a lot over the past years, typically at Sunset Station or the Orleans. Those two places are nice, but they are no Red Rock. The facility is very very clean, the ventilation is fantastic, and the equipment is all kept up well. The drinks were cheap, and they had Kona Longboarder on Tap, which was great. Also, the snack bar was very reasonable. We had 2 quesadillas and fries for less than $11. The price for bowling was also not too bad for cosmic - $4.50 a game (not including shoes). 

We were here on a Friday night for cosmic bowling. My only complaint was the music. I only noticed three types of music being played: 1) Classic Rock (I love, so had no problem here), 2) Christian pop (eh, not bad, but not really for cosmic bowling), 3) Emo (okay, it may not be actual emo, but it was a lot of skinny whining singers and the songs all sounded the same). I guess I am used to pop rock and hip-hop at cosmic bowling.

I mentioned CBW and since it's been about 3 years since we last visited, we decided to check it out. It's a great place to take family who have never been there- the fact that it is a brewery in a church makes it a unique experience before you even order a drink or food item. Do not fret because it is in Lawrenceville- it's not in the hustle and bustle of Butler Street and they have their own parking lot. There is also straight parking available if need be. 

The church itself is huge and it's beautiful. I LOVE that they were able to save this building and use it in such a creative way. Upon arriving, you have a choice between sitting in the bar area or dining area. We chose the dining area, but did ask our server for the bar menu as well (the pizzas and sandwiches were listed only on this menu). Since it has been a while for me, I decided to order the sampler- which allowed me to try 6 different beers. One complaint is that their beer menu is a little confusing to read and the paper they place the beers on do not state each beer they have. Our server named off the beers she gave me, but by the time I made it to the seasonals, I could not remember the names of the beers. Next time, I know to drink the seasonals first, when the names have not disappeared from my brain. Not to mention, their samplers are expensive- $9-$10 for 6 little beers. Although, I do have to say that their beer was pretty decent! None of their regular brews were strong and they all were easy to drink. Although I appreciated those qualities, I would have appreciated a little more complexity in their taste. One of the seasonals I tried was their thunderhop, which REALLY impressed me. Anything with fruity notes and hops, I usually love and this one was no different! The flavors were perfect.

My boyfriend wanted the corn dog appetizer to start. Three huge, fresh corn dogs were presented to us- with a spicy ketchup and a honey mustard on the side. We really enjoyed them and could tell they were homemade by their quality. For our meals, I ordered the pierogi sauté (potato and cheese pierogis with garlic cream sauce, tomatoes, broccoli and fresh herbs), the boyf ordered a steak sandwich with fries and his mom ordered the traditional  appetizer size pierogi. My original choice was the Caribbean chicken wrap, so long as the chicken could be warm, instead of chilled. My server explained that could not be done- which led me to assume the wraps were premade, which turned me off. 

I was really impressed with my pierogis. The sauce was creamy and not overpowering with garlic, the pierogis were perfect and the broccoli and tomatoes were fresh and delicious. The fresh herbs brought all of the flavors together, making the entire dish absolutely delicious. The only odd thing was that the tomatoes were cold- which was a little offsetting. My boyf was not impressed with his steak sandwich and said it tasted like ""steak umms"". After looking at the steak, I would guess that he was right about that. He didn't hate it though and was able to eat it- but wouldn't order it again. His mom loved her traditional pierogis and raved about them the whole meal. 

Our waitress gave us two boxes for our meals and even wrote what our dishes were, CBW and the date on each box. I found that to be extremely awesome and helpful! 

Overall, I think this place is famous for their pierogis, pizzas and beer and I probably won't steer off of that path. Our service was great, the food was delicious and the beers were good- it was a very good experience.

PS--if you sign up for their e-mail mailing list, you get a free CBW pint glass! Pretty sweet deal!",2015-07-08 13:35:23

They have a good menu, limited though it may be compared to some other restaurants, but there is plenty of variety for the average family.  And, what they DO have, they do WELL.
Here's another thing - they don't mind subbing out the fries on their menu for other side options like veggies!  This is a big deal for me!
I recommend the fish sandwich first.  Very tasty and a nice serving of fish on the bun too! My kids like the Gyro and order it most of the time.  Now that they're getting older and increasing appetites, they're ordering the double pita burger sometimes too.  They love both!
We've always had really good service at this location.  The staff keeps moving around the restaurant frequently checking to see if you need anything.
So, this is a family place with lots of kids present.  Expect that.  You don't want to hear them, or be around them?  Keep travellin' on down the road.  For those who do have kids, they're grateful that there are places they can feel as comfortable as they do at home.

~ Service was lacking.

Detailed Review:
We decided to try this place out for a Girl's Dinner/Night Out. I saw that it got mixed reviews on Yelp but decided to give it a try. First, who ever heard of any Mexican restaurant that charges for chips and salsa?? They were only $2.95 for bottomless chips but I love Mexican food and have never, ever been charged for them. Because I checked in on Yelp I ended up getting a coupon for the chips anyway. Our waitress Megan R. was very nice but in the end was lacking. We started off by ordering a couple of margaritas (2 regular and one virgin) and an order of Mexican corn. About 5 minutes later a gentleman brought over 2 regular margaritas. I asked him about my virgin margarita and he said that he only had a ticket for the 2 regular and maybe it was on a different ticket. Ok? A few more minutes later Megan comes by to say they were making it now (not sure if she forgot to put it in). We ended up ordering our food. 3 of us got enchiladas (comes with rice and beans too) and one of us got tacos. One of the girls ordered enchiladas with no beans only rice and queso sauce on the side and the regular green sauce on the enchilada and another one ordered enchiladas with queso sauce on the enchilada and the red sauce on the side also. At this time I asked Megan for some lemons for my water. Another gentleman brought out our food and it looked good. My enchilada was hot but the other 2 girls said their enchiladas were only lukewarm. Megan stopped by to check on us and we told her about the enchiladas. I still hadn't received the lemons so I asked Megan for them again. The manager came over and took the enchiladas back to be redone. After awhile they brought the redone enchiladas back out and I finally got my lemons. We ended up getting our check and the manager did take the 2 enchiladas off that had to be redone. We did notice on the check that they also charged us $6 ($3 each) for the sauces on the side and an extra $2.25 for the person that only wanted rice no beans. We did mention to the manager that the servers might want to mention when you order if they are going to charge more for extra sauce or a substitutions (we didn't see anything on the menu about the extra charges). They also forgot to take off the chips in the end. On another note, I did visit the bathroom during my visit and it was disgusting. Definitely needed a good cleaning. There was stuff on the walls that I don't even want to start to think about what it was. Plus it smelled in there. Basically we won't be returning here again.",2015-08-09 20:38:59

Some minor items that lost them 5 stars:

Fp7QWZXtpkycG4xDGDMyzA,x-Gbs8sVid3yhJIoHD6Gfw,WP1e-VmnTW2K0A9dMCF10g,4,1,0,1,"Came to Canis to try the dinner tasting menu. They have an 8-course option for $88 and a 6-course option for $68. We opted for the 8-course to get the full experience. 

As soon as we ordered, out came some fresh sourdough bread with two different kinds of spread. One was a garlic butter with chives and the other was a ricotta cheese spread with chimichurri toppings. The bread was nice and warm and the outside crisp, which was delicious to eat with the spreads.

They have only a small selection of beers, but the burdock American pale ale I got was awesome. A little fruity, very smooth, and went extremely well with the entire meal.

COURSE 1 (oyster, uni, parfait). The PEI Savage Blonde oysters were small but had a nice firm meat and tasty. The uni came served directly in the half-shell served on ice, very fresh, smooth, and delicious. The parfait consisted of duck pate with grape jelly with a hazelnut topping served inside a crispy tart crust. The sweetness of the grape jelly melded perfectly with the bold taste of the duck pate, and the crunch from both the hazelnut and the tart crust added some extra texture. This was absolutely delicious, I could eat an entire plate of this! 

COURSE 2 (salmon, turnip, buttermilk). This was smoked-salmon served on top of a bed of turnip salad with a nice refreshing buttermilk sauce.

COURSE 3 (tuna, maitake, snail). The maitake was so aromatic and cooked perfectly to retain a slight crunch. The sashimi-grade tuna was just lightly seared so the inside is still raw and delicate. The snails were tiny but still very flavorful, tasty, and not chewy like some of the bigger escargots. The flavors of the three components really complimented each other and were absolutely delicious!

COURSE 4 (mussels, potato, dill). The fresh dill and light cream sauce really went well with the plump juicy mussels. When you have mussels this fresh, it's so nice to have such a light delicate sauce that still allows you to taste the sweetness of the meat.

COURSE 5 (cabbage, bone marrow broth). This was one dish I thought could have been executed slightly better. The bone marrow broth tasted like the most wonderful tonkatsu ramen soup that was condensed down until it was extra creamy and rich. The cabbage itself wasn't very special and since it was slightly burnt added a little bitterness to the taste. With such a wonderful broth, the cabbage just didn't do it justice. A few pieces of pork loin instead would have blown this dish out of the park.

COURSE 6 (duck, confit, parsnip). The duck confit was an entire half a duck, which is a very generous portion for 2 people. The breast portion was so succulent and tender, and even the bone portion still had plenty of meat. The sauce reduction on the side gave the duck even more flavor. It was rather unfortunate that my steak knife was duller than a butter knife. It was very hard to get the meat off the bone with that knife and I didn't want to let any go to waste! 

COURSE 7 (pear, almond, buttermilk). The pear sorbet with shaved ice was a little sour but was an excellent palette cleanser after the rich duck entree.

COURSE 8 (milk, blondie, white chocolate). This was one dessert that I wasn't very fond of. The salted caramel sauce on top of the ice cream was too salty for me. The blondie was good, but nothing special. Two cold desserts might be good on a hot summer day, but not great when it's minus 10 outside in the middle of winter. Would have been awesome to get at least one hot dessert like a molten lava cake instead.

Overall, this was one fantastic tasting menu. There were a couple of dishes that could have been better executed, but the vast majority of the dishes were amazing. Unlike some tasting menus at other restaurants, each of the dishes had a very generous portion size. The single duck dish itself was significantly bigger than most full duck confit entrees at other restaurants. So all of this for just $88 was a real bargain! I would have to say this is one of my top-ten tasting menu restaurants. Will definitely be back again when they rotate out the selection on the tasting menu.",2018-02-03 01:50:54

I had a really good meal at Ohjah.  I went to the teppanyaki section of the restaurant, but they also have regular Japanese dining and a surprisingly extensive menu.  Prices are very fair and we even got free small sakes upon check-in.

Together we ordered the chicken and the shrimp teppanyaki meals with fried rice for one and noodles the other.  Each came with a large serving of rice/noodles, a small salad, a cup of onion soup, lots of vegetables, and 4-5oz of our desired meat.  All of this (for 2) came out to about $35.  The amount of food they provided, with quality at every stage, was actually very surprising.  The noodles and rice were flavored well but not much going on in them.  The shrimp and chicken were great.  And the salad and soup, both unexpected with our order, were a nice opening course.

I really like the speed of teppanyaki restaurants where food is constantly being served upon completion with the chef entertaining as we go.  I usually don't enjoy sitting with other people during my meal, but I guess that's part of the show.  We had a couple of weird eating neighbors so I would recommend coming with a group (6-8) to get a full on better experience.

The servers were great.  The chef was entertaining and did not disappoint in tricks and showmanship.  The portions, quality, and price were all on point.  Give Ohjah a go if you want some good teppanyaki.  And they have a few locations across the city so seek out your closest.  You might want to make a reservation or call ahead though as primetime is sometimes really full for this restaurant's live cooking section.",2016-07-17 22:48:10

I'm a southern girl so I've been looking for a comparable southern diner here in the valley for the past 6 months since I've moved here. Mr. Mamas came highly recommended and the yelp reviews certainly backed that up. 

Came during the afternoon around 2pm; not busy at all and was warmly greeted immediately whom I would like to assume is the owner or at least the manager. Each time someone left as well, he made a point to thank them for coming in and wishing them well. Impressive customer service. 

Service is definitely comparable to a southern diner experience. The set up and lay out of the place as well. I would have liked to see actual seating at the counter being that I was eating by myself so I was seated at a table for 4. During busy hours this is a disadvantage for the business when there are single eaters wanting to dine in. The place is very clean and well kept. 

Now food: I ordered the Mamas chicken fried steak and eggs. Pricing is Very reasonable considering the generous hefty serving sizes. Most places offer only two eggs where on this order it is 3eggs made to order along with a large chicken fried steak. I was also very impressed that my meal was not salty at all. Battered and fried southern meals along with the country gravy that goes on top tend to be on the salty side, but Mr Mamas did not disappoint! The flavors and taste were all separated and not blended into a salty hot mess. I could taste the lightly battered fried steak and could tell the country gravy on top had a more robust taste. 

Again I was impressed with the hefty serving size and definitely a comparable dining to home style southern cooking. The good was rather very good... But I'm giving it 4 stars because I was missing the wow factor to get that 5th star. Maybe I'll come back for the lunch side then give it the 5th star.

I liked how the staffs were friendly and they also came around to wipe down tables so you feel comfortable seating. The ambience of the patisserie is very bright and clean, white and pink in colour.

We ordered three different tarts which were all very delicious. The flavours weren't overly sweet and tasted fresh. We redeemed a cup of coffee with the purchase of our tarts by checking in (so make sure you do that!).

This is one of my favorite spots for a gourmet experience and food that is fresh and innovative.   My lunch here was celebrating a special event.  And as always, the service was impeccable, the food fabulous and I love their patio.  I enjoyed the wonderful quiche combination - with yummy pork/chickpea soup.   Others enjoyed their burgers and the cornbread BLT - everything was delicious.  

What is keeping me from giving this location a full 5-stars is two points - one within their control and one they are not able to do anything about. 

I was sad to see their adult version of the PB&J go away - it was so much fun to order and so wickedly good.  I hope they bring it back.  

Part of the appeal of this location is their expansive patio - especially in the beautiful Arizona winter - eating ""al fresco"" in the thriving Tempe downtown area.  However, a high-rise building is being erected across the street, which totally blocks the winter sun from their patio.  And, although it was a moderate day (mid-60's), we had to ask for two heaters to be brought to the table.   

I will continue to whole-heartedly endorse this fabulous venue, but just  be prepared for a change.  I hope the sun moves north quickly - which will help the early spring visitors.",2018-01-22 16:34:42

The food was awesome. The meat was tender, a bit bland but complements well with the olives.

The Goodness:  They were open on Memorial Day, that's a good start.  $5.50 0.5liter beers is another good starting point (I got a tasty hefeweizen myself).  We both had one of their off menu specials, the Lamb Loin.  It came out green beans that were mixed up and cooked with bacon and fried up and potatoes that appear to have been fried up in Parmesan cheese or something.  They were all sitting in this tasty dark liquidy gravy next to this perfectly cooked and seasoned lamb loin. The lamb loin did require a knife to cut it up...but it was still very tender.  Tender and tasty.  I can't quite describe what it tasted like.  It is kind of like a good roast, but better.  

The Meh/Bad:  While the barkeep/waitress was nice enough....we were pretty much the only people sitting at the bar.  Having to wait about 10 minutes before seeing anyone was kind of blah.  Add to that when my friend asks the lady if they have any ""lunch specials"" she rattles off their list of ""specialties"" (off-menu ""specialties"").  We were unaware that we had this much of a misunderstanding...until the bill came...then we were keenly aware.  Not sure anything ""on-menu"" was that expensive.  It cost each of us $30 for the meal and a beer ($5.50 for a half liter of good German beer is pretty good though).  

Conclusion:  This place is worth the visit.  Authentic and good German food.  You do have to suffer the service though....which maybe our experience was unusual...but it really could've been a lot better.",2010-06-03 06:42:40

To start, the rice is purple.  Yes.....PURPLE!  Apparently, it is a black rice that turns purple once cooked and is filled with extra antioxidants and other components that are good for you.  And trust me, even if it wasn't good for me I'd still be asking for it.  I don't know what it is, but it is phenomenal!

The dishes we shared were the Ahi Stack, Spicy Scallop roll, and Salmon Sashimi.   Holy moly; the Ahi Stack was unlike anything I've ever eaten.  I thought it was a roll, but instead it is a mountain of ahi tuna, crab and spicy sauce on top of a mound of purple rice topped with fresh avocado and roe.  We inhaled it, and will definitely get it again.  And the salmon is the most buttery, fresh salmon I have ever had in the valley.  They top it with their homemade fresh wasabi, which was also fabulous!

I docked 1 star because when we went to pay there was a lot of confusion and some people received their bills, some didn't, some didn't get their cards back for awhile.....it was a cluster, but definitely forgivable.

I'm complainy right now because of all the boozy bowling last night with you yelpers, FYI.

At any rate, try the Veggie Tempura... it's absolutely out of this world dreamy. It's very light, and they don't deep fry the whole veggie, they actually julienne everything, make it into little birds nest thingies, then fry it. They also add a clump of mashed daikon sprouts to the tempura so you can digest the oil better. 

Our server, Jenna, was just AWESOME and gave us some great pointers on the more uncommon effects of Sea Urchin. Hooray for aphrodisiacs. We also had this lobster roll thing with a sweet cream and tempura lobster. SO GOOD.

We've seen this place many times, but never really stopped to try it out until last night.  Place is small and a bit cozy.  We would have sat a bigger booth, but the tables were dirty with dishes and stuff.  We ordered their giant pizza and 20 wings special.  I got half pepperoni and half sausage.  We got our wings served first and they were awesome!  My wife and I prefer a little bit of crispness to the wings and these delivered.  The sauce was mild (for our kids), but it was still incredibly good.  My kids loved it.  Shortly after, we got our pizza, nice and hot.  The crust was thin, but absolutely delicious.  My daughter complained that the pepperoni was too greasy, but honestly, it's pepperoni, it's going to always be greasy.  The sausage side tasted great and we all ate very well.  When they were preparing our pizza, the guy who made the pizza asked me if I wanted to cut it into smaller slices for my kids, which I thought was a nice personal touch that he didn't have to do.  I noticed that a lot of people were calling in their orders and they were told it would be an hour to an hour and a half wait.

igiQG8DwtE5E0HOzSzcQDA,-_2h2cJlBOWAYrfplMU-Cg,SXWLhxdcFCLPnF7AlFbg4g,3,7,5,6,"This restaurant opened roughly a week ago and has some good things going for it: 1) Friendly family atmosphere (not a quiet date place), 2) Low prices and 3) good tacos.

Service was excellent, the small restaurant had roughly 4-5 servers who worked as a team ensuring you had what you needed.

Given the Unionville location, I expected higher prices. To my surprise, all entrees were about $12 - $13. A huge platter of Nachos with fresh toppings was just $8.50.      

Located in a converted small country home with Mexican decorations and artifacts provided some authenticity to the decor. It was very busy on a Sunday night but they organized the tables so you can get some privacy. Note - lot's of young family's with children, it got very loud!

My review of the food is mixed...

- Nachos were good with incredibly fresh tomatoes and Jalapeños. A good proportion of well melted cheese was provided.

- The tacos were good and the tortillas freshly made - a nice touch. You can get shrimp, beef, chicken or fish (tilapia). Although you get three tacos per serving, you cant mix them up - all three have to be exactly the same. That makes no sense and contrary to all other Mexican restaurants I visited.

- The chicken Mole was a real disappointment. They used large chunks of chicken breast that was incredibly dry. I honestly had difficulty cutting the large chunks of meat. The mole sauce had the usual hint of cocoa but definitely needed some kick.

As I looked around, everyone was adding bottled hot sauce to their dishes (provided on the tables). I get the sense they are keeping the heat levels low for the ""general public"".  I suggest providing different spice options at the time of ordering.

I don't want to be too harsh as every new restaurant needs some time to work out the kinks. The place definitely shows potential (why I'm going with 3 stars) but they need to bring the spice levels up and get rid of the ""Henry Ford Model T"" policy of ordering tacos. 

PS - please adjust cooking time for the chicken (Chicken Mole).

It's one of the few places that can draw me out of my den on a gray, rainy day with the promise of warmth, subsistence, and caffeine. 

I didn't expect to become a resident camper at Luna because it just looks so darn cute on the outside - outside patio seating, huge windows into the bakery, the bustle of Sunday brunch - so I was all the more charmed by the discovery of very reliable Wi-Fi and their subterranean seating where I could melt into the background during (what has become many) study sessions. Perhaps the only thing missing is electrical outlets, but I suppose that's Luna's way of politely telling me that we're in an open relationship and I have to share her love with my neighbors. 

The whole air is filled with the scent of decadent sweet and savory baked goods, and maintains a cheery glow. The prices are very, very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food (blows Starbucks out of the water on all fronts), and I have yet to taste something I don't like. They even serve Mitchell's ice cream! And no minimum charge for credit card.

On any given day you'll find families, friends, study partners, solo-ers, young (they have high chairs!) and old all rubbing elbows with each other and bubbling with conversation. Because bags and bulky coats can cramp the cozy space, there's a coat rack next to the bathroom. And one of the things I appreciate the most is how organized the restroom is, and the fact that they Febreeze the (literal) crap out of the air, so it's always smelling fresh despite how many people must use it every day! They have an upstairs and downstairs service station for water, napkins, utensils, etc. which makes it convenient no matter where you sit, but yes - the waiters will bring you your food if you do have a table.

First thing is that I was surprised by the prices.  Dinners begin at $15 (only 2 meals available at this price) and quickly go up to $35/plate.    I figured it'd be in line with Vogue which is around $15-20/plate and has much more atmosphere.

The sashimi was pretty decent. so we asked for two orders of oysters, thinking they were gonna come like nigiri(2 per order) because it takes time to shuck raw oysters....one of the chefs yells to the back""two dozen"" oysters! My wife and I looked at each other thinking ""we didn't say DOZEN!?"" We really thought that they were being funny, but no more than 5-10 seconds later, two dozen are handed to us....BIG RED FLAG...There is nothing more simple than a perfectly shucked oyster, plump, full with all is juice, and most importantly, free from the second muscle that holds the oyster in place. These oysters were none of that with the sunken in ""pre-shucked"" look you would see in a buffet totally disguised by the green onions, ponzu, and hot sauce  Some were even stabbed in half by the oyster knife and still clung to the shell because of that muscle on the bottom. Being in a open kitchen atmosphere is great for the sushi chefs to be able to interact with the guest, but that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice the quality and integrity of your ingredients. so as the night progressed, we tried their uni, amaebi, super white tuna etc. all okay...I see Hamachi Kama on the menu and I prepare to order that after I finish their less than impressive Frallops, rubbery calamari, and Hikari express roll with tons of crab ""filler"", and their ghetto version of Dynamite.

The prices were extremely reasonable and the employees are very friendly.  They have all the departments you'd expect in a standard grocery store: bakery, produce, fresh meat and seafood, a large live seafood area too, frozen foods, dairy, and dry goods and home sundries.  They also have a small, cafe with various Chinese take away options (you can also eat in), and an admirable selection of sake, import beers and wines.   

Now while they have all the standard grocery store departments, this one is different in that they don't really carry any of the tried and true brands that Americans are so familiar with like Kraft, General Mills, etc..  Here you are faced with a dizzying array of imported, ready to eat items that run the gamut from extremely poorly labeled 'mystery items' to easily identifiable foods in bilingual packaging.  It's nice that everything is so reasonably priced here that you can easily afford to be adventurous and try out some different foods. 

The only real drawbacks that I noticed in the store are that the aisle signage is all in Chinese, which isn't a problem if you happen to speak it, but makes it very tedious if you only want to find a few things.  In that case, you are pretty much forced to walk up and down each aisle in search of the items you need.  I guess doing that makes it more of an adventure, but I'm guessing it could be annoying if you are really pressed for time.  The store also seemed a bit cluttered and a bit dingy around the edges, but to be fair, it looks like every other Asian grocery store I've ever seen.

The employees we encountered were all very friendly and they seemed to go out of their way to smile at us and coo at our baby daughter.

the first time i got exactly which donut i wanted but did not have a cash, they told me it was a 5 dollar minimum. i kind of looked around and decided to get 5 dollars worth, the man behind the counter threw in extra donuts and i was so happy. great service. but i when i got home and took a bite it was stale and gross ( no wonder i got extras). 

the second time i brought cash! The lady behind the counter was so rude i asked for the chocolate donut and she was like ugh you sure you dont want the pig in the blanket (i dont remember the name) and i was frustrated by the time i left, and the donut had a crunch to it (overcooked i guess). 

My third and final time was today. i again forgot to bring cash, and the gentleman was trying to help me get to that 5 dollar min, i was asking what the flavors where because i did not recognize them, and he was speaking a different language. All he knew how to say was money, and thank you. the donuts again had a crunch and that is not what a donut is. 

Overall very disappointing and if i didnt live so close and kept forgetting how much i disliked it, i would stop going, they are very convenient to get to with a lot of parking, but if you have a hankering for a real donut, save your craving for a different place.

I was here for a couple nights to be with guests from the US. I thought, it was a great way to host a sleep over in less stressful way. I'm telling you, I've been to better hotels. Better Sheratons. 

In every hotel stay, every detail matters and it's amazing how some hotels excel in covering all the details and how hotels, including Sheraton, has failed to acknowledge that little things matter. What are those ""little details""? Simple. Quality of magazine, size of bathroom, type of towels, toiletries and just over all maintenance of the room. 

The magazine that was inside our room was wet so I was scared to flip the pages. Was it sneezed at? I was afraid that it would be a gem factory. 

The towel was just above the quality of Goodlife's towel service. Does it matter? Yes. Because you need to dry yourself with a towel. And room rates are not exactly cheap. 

The valet was packed so my guests had to park in the underground parking (I took a cab to get here). 

However, the pool was great and it's an oasis inside the city. The lobby looks cute with rocking leather chairs overlooking the manmade falls. Manmade people, this is not Niagara. 

If you're staying here to watch shows... it's a short walk to different theaters in the surrounding area. CN Tower is just 15 about minutes walk and a 5-minute cab ride. Tip your cabs well please.

The beans lacked flavor and well I'm not a rice person so I won't comment on that.

They are also generous with vegetables, unlike other restaurants' ""vegetarian"" pho (how can you have vegetarian pho with only like 5 pieces of vegetables??). 

The family who owns the place seems to genuinely care about you and it shows in their friendly service. The place is small and they're busy with takeout orders as well so be prepared to wait; but, it's totally worth it! The only thing we didn't really love was the smoothie but maybe it was an off day. This place is definitely a new favourite for me!",2016-02-02 03:23:16

I already have a review at another In n Out, but again i will say that the best is when you take it to go. I say that because i highly recommend to ask for it to go in a box with a lid because it will trap the moisture in the box and the fries will become soft, that's how i personally like it because unfortunately the fries do become hard quick if you don't do this process.

This is the busiest location in Las Vegas. Since of course it right next to strip accross the strip. The longest i ever waited was 45 min to get my food after placing my order, but of course the line wrapped around all the tables in the restaurant. You'll run into tourists all the time that literally will get off the plane and drive straight here before even going to their hotel. And you'll always see taxis also with tourists. It's definately an adventure. The didning room is also slightly bigger due to how busy it gets.

The good/skinny
I have to say the burgers taste very different than what I am used to but man if you have an open mind you should def try it (I think) they make there burger meat using there world famous gravy (I go for the big aloha cause it has a pineapple in it) they also use a honey mustard for the sauce and the taste combo is amazing. The chicken is always perfect and taste fresh with a side of banana ketchup (has no taste of banana and is so tasty) the French fries are so good as well always taste fresh and perfect a must if you are in Las Vegas. 
The bad 
They don't offer the aloha hot dog which I loved in Hawaii I always ask just to make sure they know they should get it in. And sometimes it can take a while for food to come out but with all good food it takes time so I'm patient :-).

uotPvEzUFzTV_2uw0Y3tHQ,_5fx5gexi9OeZIuukV2gHQ,SmkYLXEYhzwUZdS6TAevHg,3,24,12,15,"My #1 Pittsburgh Restaurant Week choice was here.  So weeks in advance I booked a reservation for Wednesday.  This was the only day available that I could get a reservation at a normal dinner hour time.  I have tried in the past to make reservations here and because I am not into eating dinner at 11:45 pm, I have been unsuccessful.  But here we were, and I was so excited to finally try B&R especially during Restaurant week.

For starters we were seated pretty promptly upstairs in a long communal type of table.  Though the tables themselves were separated (as they had to be in order to get in and out) you could easily reach to your left or right and hold the stranger sitting next to you.  It also induced an awkward situation that the waiter had  to talk to the back of my husband's head all night unless he wanted to do a 180 to speak at him directly.  The place was also very dark, which led to an unfortunate incident I shall unveil at the proper time.  Not initimatly dark, but more like bedtime dark with flickering candles.  

So to the food, again extremely excited, and again looked online at their Restaurant week menu and was eager to try the menu, but alas without making it known on Restaurant week's website, the chef decided to change the menu daily.  I can't remember what was on the website but I recall being disappointed because I really wanted to try it.  Due to the new findings the hubs ordered off the regular menu.  He went with the WAGYU FLANK STEAK prepared medium.  I stuck to the altered restaurant week menu that had four courses.  1)corn fritters with an aoli 2) a pea soup with half a toasted cheese sammie 3) A seafood pasta dish 4) A flaky cream pastry with lemon, berries and a chocolate sauce.  I also ordered a couple overpriced Manhattans.

The food came at a good pace.  The corn fritters were rather good but were sitting in a vessel on top of the sauce making it difficult to dip them individually (had to ask for some extra on the side).  Next the pea soup and cheese sandwich.  This was definitely the best thing I had that evening.  The pea soup was delightful.  The gourmet grilled cheese great flavor and worked well together with the creamy pea soup.  I will say from here my dining experience started to plummet.  Next my seafood pasta came out along with the wagyu for my husband.  So remember how it was really dark in there?  The dish was prepared with a darker noodle and my first bit was full of shrimp and prawn shells.  They left all the shells on in this dark place hidden in this dark dish.  I spent the rest of the time picking shells out of my teeth and feeling the pain of regret.  At one point I pulled a huge prawn whisker from my mouth and said that's it I can't eat this anymore.  Funny thing, my very close neighbor, who I could hear easily, flagged down the waiter and began to tell him how much she disliked her meal and I quote ""this tastes like a fishes ass.""  Sadly I looked down and we were eating the same thing.  To add to the disappointment my husband's wagyu was tough.  I mean a $30.00 steak should melt in your mouth and it was so tough and chewy, just not a choice cut whatsoever.  

The desert was average to me, I am not a big sweets fan.  I split this with my husband who adamantly believes fruit doesn't belong in deserts unless it's apple pie. But nevertheless helped me eat it.  I would try B&R again, but it's not at the top of my list since there are many other good places that you don't have to book a month in advance to visit .",2014-10-01 20:00:06

This is another great spot for beer lovers.  Great selection of beers from around the world with very reasonable prices.  Best part about Salud is that the price for your beer is the same whether you drink it there or pay and take it home with you.  They still keep the prices reasonable with no ""corkage fee"", but they do have a wide range of prices due the higher end specialty beers that they carry.  Price range is about 2$ to 20$ depending on if you want a PBR can all the way to a 22oz bottle to share with some friends.

My wife, who does not like beery beers as she says, was able to find a wide selection of sours, lambic and geuze beers that she loves.  Everybody was happy, we drank a double IPA by Mikkeller,  St Louis Geuze and Duchesse de Bourgogne.  They do have 4 or 5 taps, but the variety comes in the bottle selection.

My unwavering heart will always be with Chatime, but I'm really glad I gave The Alley a chance!  On first entrance, I got a really hipster, though welcoming vibe from the place. It's not your standard bubble tea place, but I really do appreciate their passion on tea.

The staff are VERY friendly and incredibly knowledgeable, which is always a huge plus in my books! One of the workers gave me a run through of the many drinks they offer (seeing as how dazed i must've looked) and I settled for Royal No.9 tea after having a mindblowing sample of it! It was love at first sip. It's a little hard to describe it's flavour in words, but like everyone had seemed to agree on, it's a fruity, refreshing tea taste with that hint of blueberry at the end. Now that example might not be the greatest, but believe me, it's a great taste! Personally for me, I enjoy it because it's a drink that takes you through different ranges of flavours, until you hit that high note with the blueberry at the end. Like I said, Royal No.9 tea is not an easy one to describe.

Here's my only irk about the place. Even though I will order my drinks with less ice (as i do at every bubble tea shop), it will always taste watered down by the time I'm half way done. It's something that I can't seem to put a finger on. So unless you are able to inhale your drink in record time, it seems that other reviewers have agreed that you will get a watered down taste. Maybe the next time I drop by I will try for no ice and update my recent findings?

Regardless, I'm a fan of this place, and whenever I'm in the Markham area, I will actually go to The Alley instead of Chatime. I'm rarely ever close to The Alley, so I'll be sticking with my Royal No.9 milk tea for a while.

I almost wish I hadn't, therefore leaving my memories of Salad King intact as the royalty of inexpensive and ample Thai food.  

Husband and I met for an early lunch and decided to order extra for dinner that night.  Ordered the Spicy Beef, Lime Leaf Chicken and the Islamic Noodles, all 5 chili.    I remember 5 chili's making me beg for a glass of milk, this time around, not even a slight flush.   The good news is that they use fresh chili's, 5 chili's means they cut up 5 chili's in your dish and I guess, this particular day, their batch of chili's was kindergarten mild.  

They are getting two stars because the meat was very suspect to the point where neither of us wanted to eat it.  Bad flavour, texture and consistency.  We didn't complain because I am pretty sure it wouldn't have made a difference.    I hate suspect meat, I mean, really, who doesn't? 
This was unfortunate because the favours of the sauces were wonderful.

They also have the standard Asian-buffet type desserts- small triangular pieces of cake, cream puffs, fruit, and ice cream.  I have to wonder, is there a giant conglomerate where these buffets get tiny triangular pieces of cake from?  Or did they all decide to make their cake this way on their own.

Why else would you be reading this?). Avocado with cilantro! Brie with watercress and cucumbers! Warm cheddar with mango chutney and apple! Warm portabello with cilantro!

Stop tearing out your hair trying to make only one choice. Go ahead and order a few halves and have your own little sandwich taste test.

However, the staff was friendly and the place was clean-ish. I took my grandma there for lunch. 
She ordered a Mango Smoothie and a vegetarian burger. I ordered the BLT and a vanilla blended drink. 
When I got to the table I was taken back that it was almost $50!!!!! For a coffee shop?!?!?! I thought that was insane. They didn't give me a receipt so i went back up to ask for a receipt. They dont print them, so i opted for a texted receipt. I was charged for an extra drink. What seemed to be the owner (who took our order) apologized and had someone else fix the mistake. He blamed it on the staff saying that they did it. You could tell the rest of the staff was annoyed with him. I'm sure if I worked there I would be annoyed with him as well (you'll understand why further on in the review) Just apologize and fix the problem, dont blame your staff or point fingers. That's just bad for business. 
My grandma got her burger first and then about five minutes later I got my BLT. I had to ask about the drinks because we still had not received them. This place was not busy enough to be forgetting to make drinks. A few minutes later the drinks were there. We took a couple bites of each and a few sips... Man, everything was DELICIOUS! I was not expecting that. (The major reason for so many stars)
The owner (I think, because of his attitude) came over to apologize for charging me for an extra drink. He said that they took off the more expensive one and charged me for the cheaper one which wasn't the drink I  ordered. Implying that i got a discount. I was looking straight at the receipt in black and white and they were the same price. He then corrected me and said he gave me a deal. Ummm... NO, i am literally looking at the receipt. But, I didn't feel like arguing so i just said thanks. Grandma's smoothie didn't have whipped cream on it. He had asked her if she wanted it when we ordered, and she said yesssssss please. (That too was on the receipt) So they fixed that and came back with a tiramisu for us to take home. Grandma LOVES her sweets, so she was excited. But when we got home, she tried it and said it was stale and no good. 
Our lunch was delicious, overpriced but delicious. Unfortunately, we probably will not be returning. Too many negatives. But I did give 3 stars for the great sandwiches.",2018-07-17 22:16:35

I came on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm we waited in line for over an hour and seated around 2.15pm for a table of 3, so be prepared to wait and the line is outdoors. The collective hunger and slow loss of patience creates great comradery with the others in line. Tables of 2 seemed to move by marginally faster. (not gonna lie there were also tables of the people doddling around after they were done eating...) 

Service was friendly but not as speedy for the amount of people waiting in line, the decor is quite eclectic its like you walked into someone's home. The place it very small and was a bit cramped. 

The lentil soup is amazing! and its vegan but you would never know it has this rich and meaty quality to it. Its so savory with deep flavours! 

The pan-fried tender beef liver ($14) was ok, it was slightly dry but if you like the liver taste this one is for you. A squeeze of lemon helps it a lot. The pharoh's po-boy was served in a beautiful shell ($12) The shrimp was large but the sandwich felt quite greasy. 

The Cairo classic was delish though! ($14) big serving of savory bean stew with hard-boiled eggs on top with lots of pita bread to mop up the saucy beans. It also comes with a small side salad of tomatoes, peppers and onions. It was filling and satisfying. Also got an extra side of their falafel (2 for $5) and they were great! really crispy on the outside and lots of herbs on the inside!

They have have a selection of pastries which we snacked on while in line, they are $3 each and they are quite small. The cardamon latte ($4.75) was great though, really hot coffee and sweetened with honey a bit steep in price but would get it again.

Step 1: Choose base: regular, gluten free, flax, rosemary, or firecracker. 
-We chose the firecracker. There was so much taste and the perfect amount of spice. 

Step 2: Choose sauce and cheese. The server basically chose it for us - tomato and mozzarella. I don't know if there were other options. 

Step 3: Choose any and all toppings. The toppings looked fresh and plentiful. We ended up with artichokes, olives, chicken sausage and a bit of bacon. We also got a dusting of truffle salt. I couldn't really taste it, but it's probably because of the other super flavorful ingredients.

Step 4: Sit and wait while your pizza bakes.

Step 5: Devour with a plethora of napkins nearby.

Verdict: It's TASTY, but very messy. There are forks and knives nearby if you need. The base does end up being soggy if you put too many toppings on. I'm guilty of always putting too many toppings on. How could you know when you're presented with so many options? I'm not great at making decisions like this. The pizza tried to be crisp. It really did. But alas, it could not be so this time around.

The sweet potato chips (appetizer) were delicious, although I wasn't a huge fan of the cheese sauce that came with it. I felt that the food (entrees) wasn't as special as I expected it to be. The rice was mediocre (some rice grains were very hard and too dry). My chicken in my entree was very delicious, but my sister ordered the same dish and her chicken was rubbery and tasteless. The salad was average (the lettuce was shredded by hand, so the pieces were very large). The fresh cheese sauce and pesto sauce accompanying my chicken entree were decent, but I probably wouldn't want to eat it again.

This part restaurant, part bar, part arcade is the former site of a movie theater. Today, the completely renovated space still offers several reminders of the old digs. First off, the place is absolutely enormous. The outside front of the building still has the original marquee announcing events and happenings. Inside, there's an enormous arcade offering table games, video games and more. In the back, there's a two story bar/restaurant area with a balcony over-looking the stage. The stage area is where a twenty five foot diagonal screen calls home. On most days, an HD projector streams sporting events on this and six other surrounding screens. An onsite DJ alternates between the game-day audio feed and music during commercials. On the weekend nights, the place turns into a musical concert venue. The screen is lifted to reveal the elevated stage where cover bands play. In the rear, behind the stage, there's a newly built outdoor patio with plenty of seating, a full service bar and TV's galore. All in all, it's really an amazing space. I could only imagine the overhead that it costs to keep everything up and running. 

As for the service, food and drinks, it's hit or miss. The food is your standard pub grub. Nothing fancy. Mostly greasy bar food. The beer selection is rather limited despite them having two dozen or so drafts. Most of them are generic domestics. I usually just get a Newcastle Brown Ale. The clientèle typically ranges from your average UFC fan or impersonator, jocks, frat boys sorority girls, to the average middle aged suburban dweller.

If you can get past all of that, it really is a great place to watch a game. If size is your thing that is. The giant cinema sized screens are something to be marveled. I don't know that I've ever seen something quite like it.",2010-10-12 11:27:23

- They have a lot of toppings.  That's a plus for them.  They have pretty much anything you could think of to put on your dessert.
- They need to pay more attention to their yogurt machines.  I'm not being facitious when I say that EVERY TIME I come here, there are at least 2 machines that are blinking with, ""Add Mix"".  A lot of times the yogurt comes out like soup and I have to pull the handle and wait for all the liquid to drain before the yogurt is actually a yogurt consistancy.
- Their flavors hardly ever change.  Booooooorrrrrrrriiiinnnggg.
- Their staff is made up of teenagers who are more interested in their cell phones.
- The floor is dirty.  The last time I went, it was god awful filthy with shoe imprints and smeared dirt everywhere.  Hey teenager working the counter, get off your iPhone and mop up the dirt!

They have a pretty large variety of macarons. All the flavours sounded delicious. My favourite one was the hazelnut. The macarons were made perfectly but if I had a choice I still prefer the ones from butter avenue. But these ones are still really good. A box of macaron here is pretty pricey as prices went up. It is now 6 pieces for $15, 10 for $25 and 20 for $50. The 6 piece macaron set comes in a plastic bag which is not visually appealing. Whereas the 10 and 20 come in a really nice box. This is great for gifting.  

Even though there were only two flavours of eclairs I still wanted to try one. So I ended up getting the hazelnut eclair. The eclair was beautiful. It had a nice gold colour on it. The taste was pretty good. The eclair was full of cream and the crust was nice and thin.

Some have time limits, most require you to consume all rice, and none that I'm aware of besides Hikari allows you to order SASHIMI on the AYCE menu with few to no restrictions. In my 10 years in Las Vegas, I have probably visited in excess of 30 sushi bars, and though we probably drive by at least 15-20 sushi places on the way to Hikari, we make the 16 mile trek across town about once a month because the quality, variety, options, and atmosphere simply cannot be beat. 

The vast majority of the time, the wife and I dine at the sushi bar. They also offer a teppenyaki side for the full Benihana experience, but the sushi bar is truly where it's at. The sushi chefs are quick and can handle a full bar with ease. Don't be shy, just start ordering as soon as you take your seat. 

They are open exclusively for dinner, from
5pm until 2 or 3am I believe. After 11pm, ""Good looking ladies"" get a couple of bucks off the AYCE price ($26.95 last I checked). 

The only restrictions are when it comes to multiple orders of raw oysters in the half she'll and Uni (sea urchin). Sea urchin is limited to 2 orders (4 pieces) per person and I believe it's 1 dozen oysters per person. No restrictions on time or eating the rice (which is really a moot point since you can order most fish sashimi style, including salmon, tuna, albacore, etc. Though desserts are not included on the AYCE menu, appetizers are included and enable you to order things like shrimp tempura, fried tofu, ahi poke, and salmon skin salad to your hearts content. The speciality roll menu is a little small compared to other AYCE places, but like I said, the fresh quality of the fish and the ability to get sashimi more than makes up for it. Plus, you can order custom designed rolls if you choose (just perhaps be mindful of the extra effort required and consider leaving an extra cash tip to the sushi bar chefs).

Overall, Hikari is a phenomenal value and what we consider to be the be all end all of AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. It's worth a cab ride if you're a tourist and if you're a local, get down there ASAP. You won't be disappointed.

In this case, it was the lackluster service from the moment we walked in the door. The food was predictable, the salad bar was fresh and the ambience was like all other chains of this type. So bad service is noticeable. 

We asked for a booth. There were very few diners in the restaurant and the dinner area to the left of the entrance - and far from the bar - was pretty empty. But the host chose to seat us right next to a large and loud group near the bar. Why? On a slow Monday night, the whole other quieter side of the restaurant had available empty booths but the only place he could find to put us was right next to a loud and boisterous party? WTF? I noticed that everyone who arrived after us were seated on the quieter side of the restaurant. 

Next was our disappearing and interchangeable waitresses. We started out with waitress #1 who seemed pleasant and efficient but sometime after she dropped our entrees on the table, she stopped being our waitress and never checked back with us. Later it was waitress #2 who showed up to drop the check on the table. No one checked back with us about our meal or asked if we wanted dessert or coffee. 

We had also asked for water when we were first seated and were given one glass. A single glass of water for the two of us. I guess we were supposed to share? Maybe it was just a slow Monday.

Toku-Mori +$3.00
~ extra Pork Shoulder, Pork Belly, Nori Seaweed, Seasoned Bamboo Shoots
No steam coming up from the bowl when it arrived which is a terrible sign, major points are taken off when soup is not pipping hot. Then I thought there was something odd tasting but not sure what it is and since I'm not sure what black oil is, I am assuming it was that.

+ $1.50 for Seasoned Bamboo Shoots
 This is their signature ramen, it is believe that bamboo charcoal absorb toxins from the body when it goes through the digestive system. Not sure how this was suppose to taste but it was on the sweeter side and lukewarm once again.

Anyways, we walked in on a Saturday night and there were a few people at the sushi bar but no one was in the dinning room. By the time we left there were only two other tables with no more customers at the sushi bar. Wow. Why? I can guess its the customer service. 

Our serve got our drinks pretty quickly. Remember no one is in this place. We asked for some time to look over the menu and we were done after a few minutes but the server never recognized it. Had to wait a good 10-15 minutes before she realized it. 

I ordered the BBQ Short Ribs. It came with a little salad and Miso soup. Salad and soup were very good. They gave me about 10 ribs with rice on the side. I have to say the ribs were really good. Tender and cooked just right. I enjoyed them. My wife and daughter ordered the Combo dinner with teriyaki chicken and mixed tempura. Chicken was very moist and good. Only problem is they forgot my wife's shrimp tempura. Wasn't too happy. My son got the combo of chicken and beef teriyaki which looked good and he was happy with it. 

We also had the Cardinals, Dragon, and Shrimp Tempura rolls. All the food was very good but the service was poor. It seemed like the server wasn't happy to be there. Didn't have any emotion. Just went through the motions of taking our order and filling our cups. I'm usually not this harsh on servers but she just seem very uninterested.",2013-10-29 18:14:49

The piri piri sauce has the right amount of heat and it's not oily and the rice and potatoes are always cooked to perfection.  The real star of the show, however, is on Fridays when they serve the bacalao - OMG, it's like one of the best things I've ever tasted.  After an old Portuguese boyfriend introduced me to it, I always search it out when I go to Portuguese restaurants.  The portion is huge, they use way more fish than potatoes, it's so well spiced and not too salty and they serve it with a super fresh salad and some olives.   So good like someone's Portuguese grandmother made it.  My husband loves, loves, loves their custard tarts too.

It was interesting, but if I were to order the burger again then I would probably order it without mustard as fair portion of mushrooms and onions were served on the burger.

You can tell by looking at my photo this is an above average salad. The eggs weren't that chalky well done kind but cooked medium. The salmon was a good quality and fresher than what I can find at the store ,  also prepared medium and was herb crusted. The salad was dressed perfect and was fresh and tasty. I didn't think I would like the sweet almonds but did because the sweetness was cut with salt. The salad was hearty and generous in size and all the flavors went well together.

My husband had the cabernet burger and ordered it medium rare. The Chef ran out to deliver our plates to us. He was very happy that someone ordered a medium rare burger since most people who order it ask for well done , I think we made his day. My husband said the burger was very good and we think the roll might have been made in house since they are French Culinary Trained Chefs in cooking and baking and we had the fresh baked rolls before at dinner time. The burger also was above average since the meat for it was just FRESH GROUND. I don't know of any place near by to here that does fresh ground burgers. The fries were unique. The fries had an almost sweet buttery taste to them almost like buttery pastry.

I have tried a few different burgers, but when I met the peppercorn burger I tasted perfection. Awesome peppercorn sauce, bacon, crispy onion straws, Swiss cheese, all great. I decided to try the jalapeño corn meal bun last time - skip it and get the usual onion roll.

A while back I tried the bacon aioli (seasoned mayo with a good bacon flavor plus bacon pieces) and I fell in love. I wanted it bottled to take home and put on everything possible.  Honestly, it was a reason to return, it was that good.

Unfortunately one of two things has occurred since the last time I came here: either the bacon aioli went bad and somehow became clear or someone changed the bacon sauce away from an aioli to some bacon fat slime.  When the condiment cup was put on the table I asked for the bacon aioli, they said that was it. Some dark, shiny pile of mush. I thought, well I'll try it anyway. I dipped a few fries in it and NONE of the contents would stay on the fry. They all slid off. If I was to emulate it at home I would only need bacon, bacon fat and gelatin. Not a dipping sauce.

I asked the waitress if the aioli had changed and she asked the manager, they said it had. She asked if she could try it (brave considering I could have double dipped) and by her face I could tell she hated it too. I thought they would know to take the $0.75 charge off my bill but I had to ask when the bill came.

They also took the $3 onion dip & fresh wavy chip appetizer off the menu. It was probably just too cheap and delicious.

Went on Tuesday 7-5-16 around 8PM for a late dinner. This restaurant is located on Jones between Desert Inn & Spring Mountain.  $18.47 got me a shio ramen bowl, a small order of fried rice, an oolong tea, and an order of edamame.  

$7.77 shio ramen- The noodles were nice and thick and at first I thought the broth was kinda bland but after adding some shichimi it was perfect.  I added an egg for an extra dollar.  The portion size was larger than I expected for the price.  A very good value!  The chasu is kind of thin however and not as tender as Sora's version.  

Their fried rice is a steal for $3.77...absolutely delicious and I'm craving it again already!  I also enjoyed their edamame which was served hot and salty in an adorable bowl which also held the shells.

Our server consistently checked on us, answered all of my questions about their gluten free options & was super sweet to our 1 year old, talking directly to him, which he loved & caused him to flirt with her.  The manager (or maybe he was the owner, I'm not sure) also checked on us several times, which I truly appreciate in a restaurant.
Now for the food...it was DELICIOUS!  We started out with the Chef's Plate which had meats, cheeses, olives, peppers & more.  Next up was the main course, we both ended up ordering the same thing (happens more often than not),  we got the filet & it was cooked to perfection, I decided to get the fingerling potatoes & broccoli & my husband went with the gluten free pasta option.

I was out of there within an hour, which NEVER happened in NY.  Also, it's pretty clean.  In NY, I felt itchy and gross just sitting down in the DMV, lol.  

My only complaint was that they wouldn't take my credit card for registration fees without me signing it (it said ""see ID"").   My options were to sign the card, or use another one with a signature.  When I got home I called the credit card company to see if this was their policy - they said CC holders have the right not to sign their card, but merchants have the right to refuse to use it.  The DMV actually showed me their policy on this so I had no choice...

[ PROS ]

* Food is already prepared, so service is quick

* Prices are reasonable - $7.25 for 2 item combo

* Serving sizes are big

* They have a lot of choices

* You can choose between rice or pancit, or half & half... and again, serving size is huge! The pancit alone can be a meal itself (and I'm not exaggerating)

* Staff & Manager are friendly 

* Bicol Express is deeeelish!

* Binagoongang Baboy (Pork with Bagoong) was actually really good. A lot of fat, but very tasty


[ CONS ]

* Tables are limited. When they're busy, you may have to wait for a table

* Dinuguan, Kare-Kare are a bit bland (for my taste buds anyway)

So for those who know how to cut fish, or know how to make sushi and want GOOD amazing quality ingredients for your dishes, you definitely need to come here. Their selection always varies, and they always write down the countries where the stock comes from (salmon, tuna, grouper, mackerel, squid, scallop,etc).

Enough of a crunch, but not overly hard. The crab and artichoke dip along with their special bread they fly in daily from New Orleans was creamy, hot and spiced perfectly.

Angela,our server, was nice enough to mention that the po' boy could be split between half shrimp and have oysters.  The shrimp can be ordered blackened, bronzed, fried or grilled.  I went with the traditional fried. The sandwiches came ""fully dressed"" (lettuce, tomato & mayo).  The oysters and shrimp were perfectly fried. Crunchy, seasoned and NOT oily or soft. Spot on.

After polishing off many rounds of happy hour cocktails at Comme CA, a group of eight of us found ourselves at Holsteins (located inside the gorgeous Cosmo hotel) for dinner on a Friday evening. 

The first thing I need to tell y'all is that all eight of us were fairly intoxicated before entering Holsteins. And after all eight of us ordered a Bam-Bozzeled shake with extra shots of alcohol to start our meals, the rest of the evening became quite a blur. Such a blur, in fact, that even though every single person ordered a different burger from their large menu (we also ordered appetizers), and even though I took a bite of everything ordered, I can't really recall everything I tried and if I even enjoyed it. I'm just glad I took pictures, otherwise I would have been totally guessing on some of the food we ordered. This is just a few of the items I tried that fun night at Holsteins; 

Drunken Monkey Shake- Reese's, Banana, Malt, & Frangelico Liquor
Cereal Bowl Shake- Cap'n Crunch & Absolut Vanilla Vodka
Campfire Smores- Smirnoff Marshmallow Vodka, Chocolate, Marshmallow & Graham Crumble
Pork Belly Buns
Salt & Vinegar Popcorn (Complimentary)
The Rising Sun Burger (I ordered this)- Kobe Beef Burger, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura Avocado
Gold Standard Burger- Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger W/ Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli
The Longhorn Burger- Beef Patty Topped W/ Texas Smoked Beef Brisket, Whiskey BBQ Sauce, Creamy Cole Slaw & Dill Pickles

I do remember that we all thoroughly enjoyed our adult shakes. They were sweet and thick but the bartenders were more than generous with the alcohol because every shake was just as strong or even stronger than the cocktails we had before entering Holsteins. 

I can honestly say I slightly do remember my burger being damn tasty. I loved the teri glaze on the patty and the tempura avocado was a nice touch. This burger reminded me of something I'd get at Umami in LA. As for the rest of the burgers and the apps go, I'm assuming I and everyone else enjoyed them because every plate was licked clean. 

From what I remember the service was great and the atmosphere in the restaurant was fun and upbeat. The prices here are really reasonable.  

I will definitely try Holsteins again. Next time I'll just make sure to be sober before eating here so I can fully remember my experience. Till that day comes I'll give Holsteins a solid 4 stars.",2013-04-16 03:55:32

Our order was messed up twice!  We didn't get our whole sushi order ( which was corrected), and a roll order never showed up. Both times required a get up and go to bar to inform our bartender/server.  Very disappointing to say the least.  
it would probably be a good idea to have the bartender stay behind the bar and not try to be a server at the same time.  
It will be awhile before we go try a do over.  Not sure I am up for another chance.  
But when and if we do, we will not sit in the bar area!  
The owner was too busy chatting with all of the ladies at the bar and making sure they were happy, rather than checking on other customers to see how their dining experience was.  I would have been happy to share with him. 
Our first visit there was totally the opposite.  Too bad we couldn't have that repeated.  Hmm, maybe third time is a charm.",2015-04-03 02:49:38

One should go to Zipp's because of their kickass patio, complete with a fire pit and TVs at every imaginable angle in which to view games -- even if you are the last in your party to arrive and get stuck with the worst seat at your table.  

The managers are always willing to switch it to the game you're interested in as well and don't give you the same kind of haughty shit that other sports bar managers do when you ask them to alter their precious programming schedule.

The food is good, for bar food of course, although i don't venture out very far past their Hot Wings.  They have really good beer on tap too -- nothing else quite like a 32oz. Alaskan Amber and some college basketball.

I would have to say that, as an avid sports fan who really tries to avoid watching important sporting events outside of my comfort zone (re: living room), Zipp's is the only place I will let host my antics.""",2008-01-24 16:53:39

It was clean of course, comfortable booths, we waited about 5 mins before we were seated as no one was around but our waiter showed up and told us to sit wherever we wanted...

Ordered by die of course, I had to order Iced tea and my ex ordered Hot tea of course the die made him get that, since my glands have been swollen due to oversized tonsils I opted to drink the hot tea and gave him the iced tea.

I had heard good things about the pot pie so I ordered that and he ordered chicken fried steak which he was told by our unnamed waiter was really pork which was fine..

The woman across the way from us said she didnt want the Veggies that came with her meal and asked for green beans instead and the waiter told her that it would cost her extra to substitute so when Don (my ex) decided he didnt want his Veggies, we just stayed silent.

The Pot pie was HUGE and had good flavor but was underdone, the crust was doughy and the carrots and chicken werent totally cooked, I ate a few bites and now its in my oven cooking the rest of the way through...

Don didnt care for his dinner much though he was hungry so he ate it, also he said the portions were awfully small to him, at the end of the meal we were brought the bill and the waiter came over and asked how I liked the pie, I should note that he hadnt come over before that to see how everything was...if he had, I would have told him that I wasnt very happy but I told him the truth and he asked why I didnt say anything earlier, again, he never came over earlier so I couldnt...

The certificate does not say anything about voided with new ownership. In my eyes, the name is the same and why should I care if you are under a new ownership. The life lesson is not to buy the restaurant gift certificates. In end, they did not work out anything with me even at such a low denomination.

Here are the positives:
* Marketing and Identity package is a great. I love the look and feel of the place.
* You can get three different size burgers, which is fantastic! 
* You get a choice of buns...Awesome
* They have chicken and salads on the menu...a burger joint with healthy alternatives...fantastic!
* Flavored Mayos....yes!!!!
* Mustard!!!
* Milkshakes!!!

Because I am in love with Chipotle, I had a regular burger, on a chipotle bun and substituted Chipotle mayo instead of mustard.  Dave ordered the big burger, as it came. We shared a basket of the garlic and rosemary sweet potato fries and a NutterButter shake. 

First off, if you have read my other reviews, you know I am a critical fan of sweet potato fries. These were excellent, and I did not have the desire to dip them in honey or anything else. Great twist of the flavor with the garlic and rosemary. (Even though sweet potato fries are really meant to be dipped in honey). Next, I LOVED my burger. The size was good, it was prepared well, it wasn't dry, and I loved the flavor of the chipotle. I also tasted Dave's, and it was good. He got the All American. 

The negative. The service. We were  1/2 way done with our meal when I went looking for our shake. They said they couldn't find us, even though when they dropped off our food we asked about the shake. The shake was in the cooler. After we finally got it, it was great.",2012-11-08 13:21:01

I was not a big fan of blueberry donuts until I tried theirs.  It was steaming hot and once I took my first bite I was hooked.  The taste is almost like a blueberry pancake, fluffy and not too overly sweet.  

I am sure all their sweet offerings are good here, but,  the real reason I come here is for their incredibly delicious Crullers.   Almost on every occasion we have had to wait for them to come out, but believe me you want to wait since fresh and hot is how you want to eat these airy soft delights. They are also only available on the weekends and you can call ahead to place your order. 

Mr. Rambo and his partner are very kind and generous.  They always end up sneaking an extra donut or two in our bag.   Mr. Rambo is also willing to share his Cambodian combat stories including the ones that took place  here at his donut shop as he has had a few run-ins with unsuspecting robbers, oh yeah he is armed and ready.   His story though is a real inspiring one and if you catch him on a slow evening I'm sure he will be glad to share it with you.

Everything was delicious, but honestly a bit small for the proportions. I would have expected at least 3 meatballs, at least a full hen, and maybe more of everything else.

- I always have problem decide what to eat because I just like eating anything? so I told the waiter the Special and did not even ask what that special is.. (as far as I know, none of the Arepa has raisins inside so I am A-OK)
- End up the Special of the Day is Shredded Pork and Tomato.. not bad tasting at all... and the pork is nice and soft and I love tomato too..
- That sauce!! oh I love that mind blowing, mouth numbing hot sauce!! Now that's what I call spicy!! (hot hot hot!!)
- The guava juice is quite nice...but I think I will need the beer combo to put out the hot spicy sensation! :)

The arepa itself is really good.. but a little pricey... I have still hungry, but lucky I am at Queen St West an area with a lot of other food choices to fill me up! NEXT!",2011-02-19 01:07:23

The bread is stiff and hard all throughout when a well-baked baguette should be soft on the inside. Service isn't all that different from a fast food restaurant, you get in line and pay for your order, then they call out your number.

After 10 PM you can order off the lunch specials menu, which means you can choose from 69 items priced between $5.50 and $7.50! Seriously, it's not a joke...I actually thought it was when Nelson Q first told me about it so I had to come check it out for myself.

We ordered a bunch of dishes for our table full of Yelpers, including: sweet and sour spareribs, chicken wings, sacha beef and vermicelli pot, XO spring beans, a couple of noodle dishes. All of our dishes were tasty and flavorful and I downed multiple bowls of rice along with them. The dishes are served in family style portions as you would expect with a standard Chinese restaurant, which means we had leftovers that we turned into a mix plate.

Service here was mediocre, but given that it's a traditional Chinese restaurant, you shouldn't come here expecting great service anyways. It was late when we arrived (around 11 PM) and it seemed like they were in a hurry to get us to order even though we were waiting for others to arrive.

Only halfway through my meal did I realize there was rice underneath. They leave the shrimp in the shell, which is a pet peeve of mine, as it makes eating a chore. However, the taste of the shrimp was good and strongly garlic flavored. My date had shrimp and fish with some kind of nuts that he enjoyed. We also had guacamole, which was not good. It lacked lime and salt (date enjoyed it though). Overall, I would recommend Azteca. Just be careful about what you order, as it may not be what you expect.

It is in these times we turn to comfort food and for me it's ramen. To come in from the cold and mix my own tears with the ones induced by a delicious bowl of spicy ramen noodle soup is just what the heart doctor ordered, to which I happened upon the new Kinton Ramen location on Bloor in Korea Town. 

The first thing you'll notice about the restaurant is it's clean and crisp modern appearance followed quickly by the wave of high energy the place exudes. As a customer you are greeted by all staff in a boisterous greeting in Japanese the minute they lay eyes on you. The servers on high alert hang up your jacket and seat you as quickly as possible. From there you are given a menu to browse as the onslaught of what I assume is Tokyo Pop dance music attempts to drown out the walla-walla of your fellow customers. 

I ordered the miso based ramen with pork belly. From there I was given a glass of water in a cool metal cup, chopsticks and a wooden spoon which I appreciate over the plastic or porcelain that you usually get in Asian restaurants. The soup came hot and smelling delicious. I quickly dove in and found the ramen warming me, stimulating the pleasure centers of my brain long neglected. 

The staff always attentive checked in on me periodically to see if I was enjoying everything, which I was. By end meal I was informed that if I finished every last drop in the bowl they would give me a discount card towards free dumplings and plaster my face on their facebook wall. Well who was I to say no to brilliant market ideas. I was instructed to show off my empty bowl as they snapped a picture of me via an iPad. I looked at the picture, the ramen having eeked out a smile from me over the affects of a still broken heart. 

All in all a great high energy place with delicious ramen with friendly and attentive staff. A little too cacophonous for quiet intimate dining however. Kinton exudes lots of friendly energy with their food and that's just what I needed.",2014-01-04 22:25:36

But even going up front to pay we had to wait an additional 5-10 minutes when we were the only ones up there waiting to pay. My god. These ladies love to take their time.

We had a table of four people and ordered the samgyeopsal (set for 2) and the haemool jeongol (set for 2). Both very delicious and very good portions.

The Southpark location is a bit different than the UNCC location probably due to the fact that the UNCC location took over a steakhouse while Southpark took over something else (I can't remember for the life of me what was here before TacoMac).  Anyways... parking can be a pain.  If the area is busy, and for the most part it is busy all the time, the deck can be a nightmare trying to find parking without 1) ramming into a concrete wall and 2) ramming into someone that is trying not to ram into a concrete wall.

Once you survive parking, there's a pretty big waiting area in the front of this TacoMac.  For good reason too.  The first time visiting, we had to wait about 45min (standing)... but the beer and wings were worth it [I keep telling myself].

There's a nice outdoor patio area - but I have not had the pleasure of enjoying a meal out there yet.  It's actually quite funny that the two times I have gone here, the hostess seated us at the exact same booth both times.... I can understand that happening occasionally, but this place is quite big with lots of tables.

There looks to be an upstairs at this location... don't know if it is reserved for private parties or if it's just another overflow area, but I will investigate some more!

I did mobile check in and got my room in minutes.  Room was fine except for some of the light switches not working.  The high tech rooms seem to breakdown a lot faster than regular rooms at other hotels.  Conference Center is nice and easy to get to even though it is down a very long hall.

On my last day at the hotel, I went to the hotel gym.  When I got back, I was locked out of my room.  Thought maybe me key just go deactivated.  So I went downstairs and talked to a security guard who helped.  He called someone to get me back in my room.  Security finally showed up after I call the operator and ask where security is.  Security can't get me into my room either. Another hotel staff comes by and calls someone and they say I need to go the front desk.

So I go to the front desk and talked to the manager.  Turns out overnight, they tried to run my credit card and it was declined several times.  The manager was not outrightly rude to me but her demeanor showed it.  It was if I was a common criminal trying to run out on my bill.  I have a long history at the Aria and other MGM properties so she should have been a bit more accommodating.

So I have to get special permission to be let back in my room to get my ID and credit card to prove I am not trying to run out on my bill. Security lets me in and I get my ID and card.  I then go back to the front desk where they run my card with no issues. The front desk clerk says because I did mobile check in and they did not run my card manually at the front desk, the overnight charge was declined.  

Seems that if they are going to continue to use this mobile check in, they should get their credit card processing working properly.  Also, if they had tried calling me in my room or on my cell phone, I could have easily taken care of this.  Instead I have to run around the hotel working with security and the front desk when I was in a hurry to get to my event.  And I would not have had to deal with a rude front desk manager.

I did eat lunch at the pool bar one afternoon and it was not bad. You order with the cocktail waitresses and someone else delivers your food in a bag.  I guess the food is made elsewhere on the property.  I had the falafel plate.  It had lots of good stuff on it - hummus, Greek olives, salad, pita.  That was one bright spot during my stay.

Pizza was really really good.  Menu is short and a bit too limited.  It really is ONLY pizza.  Food gets a 4.5. 

Service.  After two visits the service nets out at average or slightly below.   First visit was great although it was quite early and they started by saying ""order fast we have limited dough left"".  We thought that was a bit odd.  Not really a service problem per se.   Second visit service was just too cool, rushed and we didn't feel overly welcomed.  Service is a 2.5. 

Venue....hmmm.   I respected the art.  My wife felt afraid.  It was curious and begged some thought.  I wouldn't bring a small child here at night.  Maybe not even during the day.   It was dark and hipster cool.   But not overly comfy and the open kitchen was a blessing and a curse.    

Hygiene.  The place was clean.  I will give them that.  The owner was there and we watched in amusement as he would: decorate a pizza, touch machinery and storage bins, hike his baggy jeans, adjust his ball cap, then back to food.  It became a game for us to see how many unclean things he could touch before returning to food.   It kinda grossed us out.  If we were truly concerned we would have left so it was more amusing than anything.   And a bit gross.  I'd give it like a 2 on that whole aspect.    

What's most important?   Well.  All of it.  You go out for a meal.  And you pay good money.  The art of the game for restaurateurs is to deliver all of these things a price point that represents value.  It's not easy to do.   

If it were me, I would slightly adjust the art to eliminate the dead women with eyes gouged out, diligently train ""friendly"" into my servers and keep the open kitchen but proudly show off ""best in class"" hygiene - wash stations (being used) hair nets, clean white uniforms.   That's just me.  

I do hope this place sticks around or at least starts a trend because the pizzas were really yum.    


UPDATE.  I upped my rating.  And I will have to drag my wife back.   It appears from the pictures that they have updated the wall art.   Pretty sure the skeleton death bug and the woman with mouth stitched closed (hanging from noose?) are now pink hearts.   Hey.  I get it.   And I can see how me lady didn't dig it like I dug.   And I'm sure one pic had the owner wearing (gasp...sell out!) a white like chefs coat.    I love that.  When feedback actually gets heard.  It takes immense courage to let your customers collaborate with you to make it success.  That is super cool.  Respect.      Definitely will be back soon.

Where else can you spend $5 and select from a whole whack of veggie offerings.  They have about 10 different dishes to choose from and they are all great.  Tabouli, cabbage salad, bulgar with toasted almonds, grilled eggplant, roast potatoes, spicy lima beans, roasted beets, etc.  The list goes on.  Each dish is very well made with great seasoning and careful cooking.  None of the dishes are ""fillers"" like the plain rice that most take out places use.  Service is fast and friendly.

Many other reviewers have complained about the shwarmas.   I have been avoiding shwarmas for years because they always look like mystery meats.  Looking at the other dishes, it was clear to me that this is a place that puts a lot of care in their cooking.  So, I felt okay about having a shwarma here.  Ghazale's chicken shwamra looks and tastes like chicken!  Mine didn't come straight off the spit, but I didn't find it dry at all.  More importantly, I didn't find it greasy or made from mystery meats.

I'm guessing that the negative reviews are mostly from people that see a shwarma and have some expectations about getting a fix of guilty pleasure that Ghazale's doesn't satisfy.  Instead the food here is healthful, lovingly made and a great deal.  I plan to eat here whenever I'm in the Annex and looking for a quick bite.",2012-05-08 12:09:21

I went to Iguana Mack's in the morning(11am) on saturday. I sat at the bar(we were the only ones at the bar) and ordered food, appetizers and drinks.  The bloody mary's were awful - they tasted old or if the tomato juice was rotten. We saw a family sit down and attempt to locate a server.  After about 10 maybe 15 minutes they left after no one came to their table.  We waited over 30 minutes for the appetizer.  After we were told the appetizer would be right out when we brought it to the attention of the bartender we waited another 10 minutes before paying for our drinks and leaving.

He dropped off the dessert to be shared and didn't offered plates or more water or iced tea.  When we asked for plates for the dessert, he brought us two dirty plates that were in a pile of clean plates.  And this was a different server than before.  I really feel like the wait staff needs to work on their communication skills and how they treat and serve guests of this restaurant.

They did an amazing job with producing delicious sandwiches that met our organizations dietary needs the one day and a hot pasta lunch with salad on the second day.     

I think the difference with a business like this is that this is their legacy and reputation that they put on the line and that shows. its obvious they care about what they do when they are able to work through issues that would have normal employees stopping and asking their manager about next steps. For them, they delivered the service and dealt with the problems we encountered at a more appropriate time.  First class, to say the least.

I read some iffy reviews about different things here, but I wanted to find out for myself. So here goes what I thought of the place....

Customer service: They were super nice. They came to our table often, granted it wasn't super busy when we got there. Always looking to refill our drinks and take our dirty plates. The place is small and doesn't hold a whole lot of people so I can see how it can be long wait times when they get busy. Place was clean. 

Food: This is all based on their $24.99 ayce menu. They have a good selection of rolls, appetizers and a few desserts. We tried as many things as we could, to see how good everything was. 
For the appetizers, we tried the coconut and regular tempura shrimp as well as the tempura calamari. They were all good. My boyfriend really enjoyed the taste of the coconut shrimp. We also tried the I believe the crazy jalapeno which was ok and by far my favorite, the bacon scallop skewers. I could've just eaten those all night. I'm glad there's not a limit on them. 
For the rolls, they have a variety of specials, a list of shrimp tempura rolls, baked rolls and deep fried rolls. We tried the 
NewYork NewYork
Sexy Lazy
Sexy Bomb
Hot & Juicy
Taste Like Girlfriend
They all were good. I liked the Sexy Bomb, the best. It was delicious. I was really happy to see that they had a whole section of shrimp tempura rolls because they're my favorite ones. 
For the desserts, I really wanted to try the yuzu sorbet, but they were out, so I got a mochi instead because you can never go wrong with mochi. They allow you to pick 2 desserts per person. Besides the mochi, we tried the choco banana and tempura ice cream and they were both amazing. The choco banana is 4 pieces of deep fried bananas and vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup. I loved it! He got the tempura ice cream which I think was green tea. I didn't like it because I don't like green tea, but he absolutely loved it and ate the whole thing, after he said he was too full and was only going to take a bite to see if it was any good.",2017-07-01 07:33:19

Came here with a bunch of friends on friday for happy hour which is from 3 to 7 I believe.  The place is cute but its not a date night kind of place.  Its like a family/old people fancy diner kind of a feel.  We sat at the bar and they have a good happy hour menu.  Select beers for only 2 bucks!!  How can you beat that??  Cocktails and wines for 5 dollars.  Food ranges from 4 to 7 i think.  Between us we got the edamame, the crab balls, fish taco, fried green tomatoes and the buffalo sliders.  

Sliders were huge portions!  Came with fries.  Pretty decent for the price.  The friend green tomatoes were just ok.  I was really excited about it but it tasted like fried firm tomatoes.  The crab balls were a little dissapointing.  It has a lot of breading and the crab tasted a little fishy.  The bed of onion fries it came on was good though.

I would also say that the fish taco was ok.  They gave you a tiny dollop of quac, which was pretty good.  Otherwise it was decent.  Nothing too special or that memorable.  

I was initially really excited to come here but after trying everything, I was underwhelmed.  Food is decently cheap but just lack flavor.  Atmosphere was meh... nothing fancy or sexy.

First a couple of years ago some genius in management decided it was time to screw up the Palm Member card. They changed the rules so that the $7.00 lobster that they charge about $70.00 was taken away from the birthday gift. I  feel sure they lost more customers over this dumb move than they will ever get back. Then they try to re-charge you for a card you formerly had that was good from then on. Next they decided to resort to used car dealer tactics like slipping you a $14.00 glass of wine and upping it to $18. I was not a math major but 3 glasses at $18.00 and I could have bought 6 bottles of the 9 dollar wine at Total Wine The issue is the fast and slippery move from $14.00 glass to $18.00 glass feels cheesy.

When it's all said and done, Boca Park Animal Hospital is at the top of our list for great veterinarians.

Our regular vet is Dr. Anderson--we completely recommend her, although the other doctors we've worked with on occasion are just as amazing.  They have always taken time to explain everything about what they're recommending for us, what they're prescribing, and even take time to share extra details that might not be necessary but add to the care of our animal.  We've even been in to pick up a prescription and leave, only to have Dr. Anderson see us and take the time to simply say hello, or ask about our pet.  This has been the norm for this wonderful place, not the exception.  Speaking of picking up prescriptions, the ladies who work the front desk are always social.  If you end up having a short wait for your prescription, they seem to ensure the time flies by.

The facility is very roomy, open and airy.  Most vets we've been to stuff owners and patients into what seems to be the tiniest possible waiting room where everyone is constantly busy trying to control their animals and keep them quiet.  Not here!  There's lots of room, making it very comfortable for owners and animals.  They even have separate entrances for cats and dogs!

Boca Park Animal Hospital will board your pets too, and have exercise areas to ensure your critter has time outside of the kennel.

It's definitely easy to get to and find, right in Boca Park Fashion Village along Rampart.  You can't miss the building.  If you need a vet, or a place to board your pet, give this place a look.  I truly think you'll like what you find.",2016-09-20 15:29:38

When I walked in, one of the staff (barista guys) was being overly attentive to a lovely MILF and her little toddler. Said barista was overly eager to make her uninterested toddler a chocolate milk that's not on the menu. Great right? Well not really when there's 4 paying adults waiting in line; One of 2 staff is personally tending to the kid, while the other guy is busting is ass behind the counter trying to get everyone's order, cash them out AND make the drinks.

It took 14 minutes to get my iced coffee. sigh/ Normally I'd never wait that long for an iced Americano, but lucky for me, I had the time to wait around. Next time, I won't.

I grew up in Georgia, so I grew up on the fil-A (wheat bun, extra pickles). I've even been to a Dwarf House. 

With two golden-fried chicken breasts, slaw, special sauce and pickles, the sandwich absolutely did not disappoint me. Sure it was a bit intimidating when it arrived in all of its 6-inch tall grandeur, but I gave it a good squeeze, cut it in half, and immediately devoured every last bite. It had a winning combination of sweet and sour, and the chicken was nice and juicy. For $13, I would definitely order it again and again. It is served with a side chopped salad that has some unexpected ingredients including kale. In case you were wondering, I ate every last bite of that too. 

The restaurant is open, airy and rustic. I can't get enough of such inspired spots. From the chairs to the napkins, you can definitely see that there is passion for what is being executed. It is perfect for lunch dates, moms, first dates and more. The also have patio dining, but you can't have alcohol outside. 

Service may have been a tad slow, but I think that will improve with time. 

I have also had the opportunity to sample a couple of other things, and from those, I would also recommend the scallops (the truffles really work in this dish), the curry (a sweeter variety, but good) and the tuna crudo as a starter.  

We will be back. Next on my list to try: Midnight Rambler. (It's their  bourbon cocktail.)",2012-11-09 20:22:39

I've reviewed a Raising Cane's location before, but today I had some time to kill before a meeting, so I decided to pop in to RC's. My Dad was with me, and it was his first time at this fine establishment. He can write his own review, but I know it will mimic mine.

This place is legit. Everything is made to order. The menu is pretty simple. Chicken Fingers, Fries, or a sandwich with Chicken Fingers and Fries. That's about it.

It's pretty much the best fried food out there. Yes, its a little unhealthy, but who gives a rat's ass. The chicken is marinated for 24 hours, nothing is frozen, and....you get Texas Toast!!

I got the famous Box: 4 chicken fingers, crinkle cut fries, slaw, Texas toast, and a drink. All for about 7 bucks. Not bad, considering this is pretty much the best meal you can have in the QSR (quick service restaurant) world.

Also, you must try the secret sauce. I don't know what's in it, and I don't care. It's amazing. Think of a peppery, tangier version of fry sauce (google it). 

Since you may be thirsty, get the awesome lemonade. Fresh squeezed. Served in ice pellets. The only way to roll.

I have friends that went to school at Florida State University. A fine University that I respect just as much as my beloved University of Utah. I know many Seminoles will rave about Guthrie's. Not entirely sure if this place is a knockoff, but if you like Guthries, I imagine you'd like RC. Same menu, same concept. Except in Vegas.

Hop to it, Noles and Yelpers alike. This is one of my favorite establishments....anywhere!

I gotta say that I was impressed. We were greeted promptly and given a good table. They are very kid friendly as well. Our waitress was very friendly, attentive and helpful. The fries with some sort of remoulade sauce were tasty. Could not stop eating them and took some to go. 

I missed having a good calamari app and this one did not fall short of expectations. Crispy light and flavorful with a great tasting marinara type sauce. We also ordered the hummus and eggplant appetizers. This is one of 2 reasons why this is about a 4 - 4.5 star review. The food runner dropped off the the apps but failed to give us any type of flat bread or whatever for dipping. Our waitress was able to correct this about 6 minutes later. 

Entrees we had the chicken curry with basmati rice....winner winner you know the rest. The Moussaka unexpectedly had beef, duh shoud have read the menu better, but was nothing short of great. 

We took some gyros to go for some friends. Had a bite later, the meat was great, good tzaziki sauce, but it just needs a better wrapper. Don't know what they are called, but I have had them in other places, almost like a naan bread or something.

The special on the chalkboard by the hostess stand was winking at me as soon as I walked in the door.  $13.95 for Red Curry Fish with rice and a side salad.  When I ordered the special from the waiter I had said I would like the curry more on the mild side and he said 'yes yes' and appeared to write that down.  So yes I was very surprised when I got a shrimp appetizer instead of what I ordered (yes it was another special listed on the board).  It wasnt as though it was supposed to be sent to another table, our waiter literally had no idea what the specials were and just decided to pick one for me?!  Thus ensued more frantic behavior from the staff.  When I did get my dinner (while my lovely dinner partner just picked politely at her plate so as to not be rude)  the dish was fine (not great) but the side salad was lost in Never Never Land....

So when he brought the check and had charged me the full amount, I politely pointed out that either he adjust the bill or bring me a side salad to go.  He did the latter.

Jaburrito's thing is sushi burritos. For those of you who don't enjoy raw fish they do have chicken, steak and cooked fish. They have burritos that have names or you can just create your own. Which I suggest you do. You can also make it a bowl or nachos. 
It's an assembly line situation. You go down the line and tell them what you'd like in your burrito. What I like in my burrito is I start with the traditional seaweed paper and sushi rice. For my protein choice I pick raw salmon and tempura shrimp. Next, you move onto sauces. If you are unsure of a sauce you can always ask to sample it. I like the poke sauce and the chipotle mayo. Last, you move on to veggies and things. I like to add guacamole, cream cheese, cucumbers, and roasted corn. Jaburrito has a super sweet machine that presses the burrito all together. That's it! You have a fabulous and tasty burrito.

Inside, there are stereotypically middle American types:  men with cowboy or baseball hats; there's country music playing in the background; there are some hot chicks walking around, but most of the women are as overweight and roughly dressed as their male companions.  You might  feel uncomfortable, especially with the guys, who look like they're with a motorcycle gang, with their bellies hanging over their belts and looking like they can tear you in half for not knowing the difference between a Harley Davidson and a Tonka.  You look at the bar, where everyone's belting down whiskey and bottled beer and instead of nuts or pretzels in the bowls in front of them, you see plates of ... sushi?!?

That's what Takamatsu's reminds me of.  It's a bar, that's not a bar (not open on Sundays and closing way too early during the week to be a ""real"" bar for anyone); and it's a restaurant that somehow found its way into a bar.  If you have any doubt this is REALLY a bar (or once was), you need only look at the dark colored interior with aptly placed soft lighting and lack of windows.  This is THE bar you remember from the middle of Nowheresville, where people came on a Saturday night to get drunk and get lucky.  But wait!  You can't have a cowboy bar without snacks ... so they attached a sushi bar and hired someone to serve Korean food with your Heineken and Jack Daniels.  Frankly, had Kim il Jong walked out of the bathroom (complete with advertisements inside for Ju Jitsu classes), I wouldn't have batted an eye:  it would have seemed completely normal.

I'm not inclined to say, that the dark colors and poor lighting actually induce an atmosphere of happy dining.  While the service is good and the food decent, I almost expected to hear the sound of slaves from the kitchen preparing rice and soup for the miners no doubt toiling behind the restaurant and guards in solid green uniforms with red armbands strolling into the place to let us know our meal was over and it was time to get back to work.  For those of you familiar with the Wendy's Soviet fashion show commercial of the 80s, the atmosphere was sorta liked that  (if you don't know the commercial, look it up on YouTube!).  

The food itself tasted good; but the portions were far from large and the traditional appetizer plates they give you with Korean food skimpy.  Service was excellent, so I can't fault that.  But honestly, for the prices, there are better in the Valley ... and you can actually see what you're eating in most of them.

Hmm how about...

B for bountiful! Studio B buffet has so much selection! They have all kinds of food- like Italian (pizzas, pastas), Chinese (orange chicken, fried rice, chow mein), Thai (yellow curry, red curry), American (turkey, prime rib, fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes), Mexican (Spanish rice, enchiladas), breakfast entrees (eggs, bacons, corn beef hash, potatoes), all kinds of salads and a abundant amount of different desserts  (creme brulee, meringues, cheesecakes, gelato)

B for beautiful! Studio B buffet's presentation of food is simply beautiful. The desserts are a perfect example of this. They have colorful meringue cookies (pink, yellow, green), cute dessert shooters, cheesecakes drizzled in sweet strawberry syrup, small awesome looking fruit tarts and scrumptious multicolored gelato!

B for brilliant! Studio B buffet has a brilliant setup! The overall buffet atmosphere is a true winner! I like how they showcase different clips from the food network all around on large screens all around the buffet. In between the clips, are cute cartoons of dancing fruit! When we were there, at the dessert bar, there was a Super Mario cake that was a winner at a dessert contest. It was one cool looking cake. Visually pleasant and hip all around, one can enjoy scrumptious food in one of the coolest looking buffets in Vegas.

Lastly, B for best! Yummy tasting food, good selection and nice presentation of food and cool place = Studio B buffet :).

The quality of the food has also gone down hill. The hot dogs used to be so flavorful with a crisp outer skin that would snap when you bit into it. Now the dogs are pretty bland even when they're covered in all the toppings. By the time I got my hot dog and took it to the table, the bottom of the bun had turned to sludge and when I picked it up, all the toppings and half of the hotdog fell out of the bottom. 

I tried the fried pickles and was equally disappointed. The pickle spears were incredibly wet and the batter was not sticking to them well. The breading on the inside of the fried pickle had not cooked thoroughly so there was a spicy, flour-y sludge between the fried outside and the pickle inside.

One simply cannot do justice to the food here because it's so outrageously delicious that the right words don't exist.

I should end it there but let me give this review a shot:

Ambience: visited when they were at their original location (they've now moved to a bigger space) and the two floor restaurant was cute beyond words. Cozy and cute would be my description. 5/5

Staff: given that everyone who works here is related, the staff is lovely to deal with. They're warm, friendly, and personable leaving you wanting to befriend them all. 5/5

Food: oh, the food...... mom and brother make the majority of the dishes and they are seriously outstanding. The mac and cheese with ham is literally the best I've ever had in my entire life!!! I can't even describe it to you but this is one dish you need to ignore calories/health/weight for and simply enjoy to your hearts content because I highly doubt that you'll be able to replicate it at home (sorry to all the master chefs at home but trust me...this dish is on another level). The crispy pork belly with celery root purée is also something to write home about: perfectly cooked and super yummy... that celery root purée is one which I want to eat everyday of my life..... 10 stars out of 5 for the food here!!

Price: very fair for what you get although I've noticed that they've now increased the price of some of their dishes by up to $7 (I guess due to popularity)!

Nothing Bundt holds true to their name and specializes in bundt cakes. They come in various sizes from minis to large cakes. It might sound boring just having one thing, but when you take one thing and perfect it, it's definitely a recipe for success. Different frosting patterns are available as well as cake toppers and decorations. The selection of flavors is pretty vast and the cakes themselves are incredibly moist. My favorites so far have been raspberry white chocolate and pecan praline, but I've also tried red velvet, marble, and carrot cakes. All are delicious.

I also must mention that I am the kind of person who likes to wow, so when a special occasion is going down, I like to get that special someone a sweet treat. I've ordered cakes for work potlucks, birthdays, and just because. The cakes are good for really any occasion and the recipients are always wowed and pleased, so mission accomplished.

It's in a good location in Blakeney, right next to Best Buy, and it doesn't have a lot of competition in it's category (fast casual). I would say McAllister's is a competitor; however, Newk's is owned by McAllister's. 

One of my favorite things on the menu is the Newk's Q. It's a warm sandwich with sliced chicken, cheese, bacon (which I don't get), and a white barbecue sauce which is quite good. When Newk's first opened, the sandwich was awesome. The chicken was fresh, all white, and delicious. As time went on, the sandwich kept getting worse and worse--the chicken would have brown edges that were unattractive, the amount of chicken was less, and there wasn't enough sauce. Then it got better again, back to where it started. Then it dropped off a bit. It's really a fantastic sandwich when it's at it's best, but that's not all of the time.The salads are very good for the most part, and the pizzas are okay--nothing to write home about. 

Service is very good. You place your order at the counter and they serve it to you and check on you sometimes, so it's minimalistic, but really no problems. Decor is nice, it almost has a California vibe, which is nice for a fast casual place. Overall, I would recommend Newk's because it's a probably one of the better fast casual places in the area (not a fan of McAllister's at all).",2012-04-06 14:31:39

We ordered on the phone and they don't repeat your order back to you but when they get your order wrong, they claim that it's your fault. I am honestly not a difficult customer by any means but this place lacks any sort of customer service. We placed a simple order on the phone and repeated it to the lady multiple times. 

When my bf arrived to pick up the order, the order was wrong. Instead of 59 it was 69 that they gave. The lady said, ""this is what you got, what do you want? An add on?"" And he was trying to explain that the order was wrong. They started raising their voices at him basically blaming him for their mistake. So they get him the correct order and the order looked half of what is normally served. They clearly were annoyed and didn't care. They're lucky that he already paid and tipped before noticing the error because they did not deserve the tip. 

I completely understand that mistakes can happen but blaming the customer and raising their voices because THEY misunderstood is terrible business ethic. If they simply acknowledged their mistake and corrected it appropriately then all would be fine. This is not how to run a restaurant or any business for that matter. What a shame because I have family, friends, and co-workers that love pho but I would not recommend coming here to any of my friends and family any longer due to the terrible service.

Js5IgegR_u5PwCZ_i3CLlQ,PbuXIB-7MRXcf1Ueg_g2lA,Fwt0ia7H80q_mHLvrf1gzQ,3,3,0,0,"This whole restaurant is based on you consuming seafood. If you don't like seafood - this is not the place for you because it cuts your variety down to less than half the restaurant. We got in around 5:30-5:40 so we had zero wait time, the place was already packed and the food was fresh. 

I was happy here and left feeling extremely full but I would never go back. It lacks in variety and focuses purely on seafood. 

Food:
Crab legs, mussels, shrimp, the sea snail, oysters, snails in cream sauce,lobster pie, baked mussels with cheese, baked oyster with morning glory, teriyaki clams, torpedo shrimp (best I've ever had) and baked sole.All delicious. There is a seafood lady who will give you the oysters, sea snails and scallops. She keeps moving around so I noticed some had to search for her.

There was a huge selection of roasted meats. I got to try the pork belly - let me tell you that this was porky, juicy, melted in your mouth and that skin was sooooo crunchy - exactly like its suppose to be. I got the steak with onions - the steak literally melts as you chew.

I also tried the soba station which was delish! Mango tango ice cream tastes like its from Baskin Robbins which was another plus point. 

Let's talking about the downfalls:
Not much variety in terms of carbs - very few noodle/rice options. The restaurant isn't very well organized in the least. There are people sitting in the food area when generally they quarantine the food in a central location and the tables are placed on the outside. This caused the dessert section to be disjointed, the gummy candy section to be beside the chilled seafood and random soup in random areas. 

Dessert section wasn't what I hoped it would be and was subpar. The fruits were probably the best part which is really sad.

Decor:
I liked it - it felt alittle upscale and reminded me of spoon and fork. Bathrooms are clean and trendy. Plates always seemed to have alittle water on them and in the food stations - you quite literally had to hunt abit for plates I found.

Service: 
It was really good. My plate of crab shells or finished food never sat near me for long - constantly emptying them and filling my water. It was great never having to ask for anything besides the bill and a crab cracker. Everyone is really friendly and you get the vibe they are having fun. 

Overall:
If you are going for variety - head to wok of fame. They have more selection, much better desserts and things make sense in terms of getting your food. 

If you love seafood - this is for you and you will enjoy the experience. 

Do I think this place is worth the price - yes because they heavily specialized in seafood. If you aren't big on seafood - this is a waste of money. 

Even though it was a good experience with good food - I would never go back. I recommend this as a one time experience. Go for the thrill of the fresh seafood.",2016-03-20 14:43:41

When we asked for water she would point to the other table and tell us to get it from there. Keep in mind the pitcher was EMPTY!

I happened to be in Vegas and met up with a friend who was taking his nephew out for a wild weekend in Sin City. He took his nephew out to a strip club. I passed on that adventure. But when he told me he was going here I was curious. A humvee came to pick them up at the Paris Casino and I hopped aboard as well not knowing what I was getting into. When we arrived at the location about ten minutes later we watched a tank crush a used car. Somebody paid 3 grand to dsomething like that on a YouTube video and completely amazing to see it right in front of you. My friend then spent a few bills on a package that let him and his nephew fire off enough rounds to kill two waves of zombies although from the looks of the targets when they brought them back to us I'm not sure we would have survived those waves intact. Myself I did an a la carte 25 rounds of an Uzi for 40 bucks. Yep it was fun. Looking at my target I definitely need more practice so I'll have to come back another time when I feel that urge. Place is run by folks who give off that ex-military vibe. They can send a humvee to pick you up and drop you off for a tip. Never been to the other places where you can fire off rounds in Vegas - New Frontier Armory, Shoot Las Vegas, Gun Garage, Strip Gun Club, Machine Guns Vegas so I can't compare but everything about this place was professional and safe.

Now the NW location is the worst- Let me tell you...
One night we had a group of 8 drinking beer, eating wings from about 7pm-midnight. One guy doesn't drink but wanted 10 wings on special. Well the deal is you have to buy a beer to get the special- Our waitress REFUSED to give him the wing special EVEN THOUGH 7 other people at that table had probably consumed  close to 10 beers each by the end of the night. So whatever, he paid full price for his wings. After we had paid, I guess the guy who had paid full price for his wings didn't tip our waitress (Note that the other 7 of us had!) She proceeded to follow us out to the parking lot and ask why he did not tip her- Embarrassed, he went back in and she stood there and watched him while he made a credit card transaction for a tip.

On my way in from Los Angeles, I needed a quick lunch & didn't have time to stop anywhere else.  I really enjoyed my lunch at Cili, but maybe that's because it was the one time out of the year where I guessed correctly on what would be delicious on the menu.

First of the all, the prices at Cili are extremely reasonable.  Most salads & sandwiches are in the $12-$15 range, and I don't think anything on the menu was over $25.  I thought it might be more expensive, given the cost of the golf here, but that was not the case.  I ordered a Mediterranean salad & satay skewers, & both were excellent!  The satay skewers were a mix of beef & chicken, elegantly presented on a cut pineapple with a few vegetables thrown in.  It also came with 2 sauces & I couldn't make up my mind which one tasted better, because both were so dang good.  One was a red curry sauce, and one was a ginger/soy sauce.  Just cut your meat in half & try both.  You can't go wrong.

The Mediterranean salad was also good with a nice mix of greens, feta cheese, olives, tomatoes, etc.  But the one thing that I thought was particularly clever was that the croutons were toasted pieces of pita bread.  Why haven't I seen this in other greek salads?  It's such a great idea!

Four stars for good service & good food that doesn't break the bank.",2013-10-30 06:07:47

Went for dinner on Saturday night, got there early and were sat right away.  The chips and salsa were good.  I ordered a Paloma, which was tequila and grapefruit juice and more, but I don't think its what I received.  I could have sent it back but it tasted fine, so I drank it.  We had some queso to start, that was also good.  For entree I got the camarones mexicanos, basically shrimp with onions, mushrooms, green peppers, in a tomato sauce with rice and cheese.  First shrimp tasted very fishy, the rest were better.  But the dish had a sourness to it, the mushrooms were the worst offenders and I couldn't figure out why so I stopped eating them.

So the food overall was fine but the restaurant kind of skeeved me.  There was water underneat my feet so that bugged me, then one of my friends touched some gum stuck under the table and at that point I was done.  I mean I know we're at a restaurant at a Days Inn but come on!!  Finally our server was just not very good or friendly and I sat with an empty water glass for a while.

I came here with a group from school and they gave us deal..  I came a little late, but it is all you can eat so I wouldn't miss much.  The selection of meats they had were pretty limited compared to the other places I have been to.  I stayed away from the chicken, only because most of the party said that it was ""dry"".  Of course I load up on the bacon wrap chicken and sausages.  That was probably one of the alright item to eat.  I am sadden to say that the signature meat was over cooked and also dry.  Then I gave it another try when the gentlemen came out with a new batch, much better.  I would probably say that the grill master in the back needs to be more attentive to the meat they are cooking.  The salad bar was impressive with a huge selection of things to go along with the meat.  I like the fried bananas; probably the one thing I grabbed a plate of. The group seem to enjoyed the pineapple they had, but I had one and passed after.  They just grilled the pineapple up and there wasn't anything special about it.  The other place I have been to had a pineapple grilled with cinnimon and sugar which made it sweet.  Here it was sour.

The service was wonderful up until when we started to slow down and they all vanished.  My cup was empty and was wondering if any other meats were going to make their way back out.  My group was done so I didn't want to be the only one left sitting and eating so I decided to leave as well.

You should be sure to check the menu in the bar and decide on something before going in and settling down to watch your movie. The light available in the theater is not enough to even read the menu. Likewise, it's not enough to see the food your eating very well or to sign a check and write in a tip.

The negatives above aside, the seats are the best available in the theater world. Something akin to a La-Z-Boy recliner with a swivel table and drink holders big enough to hold your liter-o'-cola. Assigned seating is also great because it ensures you don't need to line up and fight tooth and nail to claim the best seat in the house. Service was excellent too. I can't think of why, but the server we had was cheerful and ever ready to do her job of risking her life up and down stairs in the darkness to bring us our lukewarm meals and room temperature soggy sweet potato fries.

The movie quality and lighting in the theater is perfect, as expected. But the one thing that enhanced my experience (and mind you plays no role whatsoever in the quality of my review) was the intensely rude guy behind me.

Yum Choy - chopped greens were cooked well and loaded with stalk and leaves.  Very good.
Pork ribs - cooked with chopped pumpkin.  Greasy & blah.  Not good.
Beef ribs - loaded with black pepper and also greasy but good flavor.

You know that awful, dense rock of food that's left in your stomach after most Mexican restaurants that prevents you from doing much of anything afterward except sitting in front of Netflix and hating yourself until morning? Yeah. You don't get that when you eat here.

The food is more akin to food truck tacos--always amped up with some fun little twist. And with WAY more veggies and better sauces than most of the other guys.

I always feel guilty when I eat heavy enchiladas and greasy fajitas. But I don't feel gross when I leave Pasqual's--and I think that says something.

The margaritas are standouts: try the lemony basil one or the cucumber (chipotle? cayenne?). Both are just LOVELY.

Service is good. Don't let the hostess trick you into sitting across from the bathroom (it doesn't smell bad or anything, but even in an empty restaurant, I don't want to sit anywhere near a bathroom).

This restaurant has been put together with love and precision and it shows.  I don't care how busy this place gets, they always have their game face on and I believe everyone genuinely loves working here and it shows.

Lets get to the important part, the food.  The menu changes based on seasonal offerings, but I have yet to have something on this menu that I did not love.  I will focus on our meal yesterday for lunch.

They always bring out a complimentary bread with a spread, yesterday it was a thin crispy wafer like bread with a compound butter.  It was delicious, crunchy and light, perfect for lunch.  I started with the Smashed Pea Soup, hubby started with Calamari.  The calamari was fried, but it was not oily and it was very flavorful.  My soup tasted as if the peas had just come out of the garden and were made into my bowl of soup on command.  The soup was just plain delicious.  

We then had the My Wife's Favorite Salad (name of salad) and The Caesar with Chicken.  My salad had duck confit (you read that correctly), spring mix and frisee with slices of mandarin and a fried egg on top.  It was ridiculously good and I am happy to learn that is it a standard on the menu because I will have to go back for this and soon.  Hubby loved his Caesar, but was not thrilled with his chicken addition.  He found the chicken lacking in flavor and moisture.

It's basically an omlette with small pieces of scallop, with sesame seeds, green onions, bonito flakes, and Kewpie mayo drizzled on top.  It tastes like an omlette on rice.  Eh, not sure else to say about it. 

I've heard that the ""it"" item is the takoyaki.  At $4.99 for 6, it's actually one of the higher priced items on the menu considering there are udons at $4-5 and rice bowls for $9.  The takoyaki is made-to-order, so unfortunately I wasn't able to stick around the 20 minute waiting time for it that day.  Ahh well, there's always next time?

That said, I'd come back again if it's to serve as a simple takeout or quick lunch type of function.   The minimalist, food-courty kind of atmosphere isn't one where I long to hang out for too long.  There's just nothing that stands out for me in particular about this place.",2015-10-19 20:45:53

So many of my favorite Sunday lunch stops have decided to close on Sundays, so AYCE sushi for $18 sounded great to me.

The space is new, I think it used to be a hardware store. All the furnishings are brand new, with kind of a traditional meets modern vibe. 

Initially, I was leaning toward 2-3 stars because service was really slow. Maybe I got forgotten, because I was seated behind a pillar. Lunch took almost an hour and a half. Not to mention, they ran out of gluten-free soy sauce even though that was the first thing I asked about before I sat down. Then they told me it was an extra charge. Charging me for having an allergy I didn't ask for... kinda bums me out.

However, I was really impressed that the manager actually ran out to Sobey's to get me a bottle. And the waitress, albeit rather slow, was really friendly and knew which menu items were safe for me. The wakame (seaweed) maki was delightfully briny, and the avocado cone was buttery and not skimpy on the avocado despite being AYCE. The tea was fragrant and I loved the pot that it came in. So many places have pots that spill half the tea on the table, but theirs was designed really well. Novel! 

I had one main waitress and a couple of other servers running food to my table, and all of them were slow but friendly. No one came back after my last plate of rolls was set down though, so I had to figure out how to pay by myself (you walk up to the front desk). The manager was all smiles and apologetic, and didn't charge me extra for the GF soy sauce after all.

I would probably come here again by myself or on a date. Given how leisurely the service was, I'm hesitant to recommend it for large groups. Fat and sassy for under $20 is hard to find in this city, so check them out!",2015-11-22 22:57:01

The meatloaf sandwich had mashed potatoes over the bread and a tasty cole slaw on top of the meatloaf . Unfortunately the potatoes were very over mixed and were extremely gummy .

It's very close to my place so I like it but for first timer it can be tricky to find the location since the way to the store is some what hidden. The space is small, plenty of parking spaces and a lot to order from so can be bit difficult to decide. we ordered espresso something with boba drink, taro with boba and Thai iced tea with boba and came out about $18. And all the sizes are regular... (to my boba experts... we know that with that price you get large and can add extra topping compared to others) that's why I say price is higher. For taste, of the three... taro was the best but way too sweet and doesn't give you the tastes of taro I am used to. And espresso drink was bitter (which I like) and Thai iced tea was unique experience. Compared to other ppl's boba.. all three drinks boba was fine! Because the tastes are too sweet I don't think I can go here as my go-to boba place. However, for ppl who wants to try out the new flavors or take cute pic.. I recommend!

I am not a big fan of most Mexican (order by number) or Chinese (Buffet) restaurants and am always seeking out the most authentic experience possible.  Having had great Szechuan style cooking at Gu's and Masterpiece off Buford HWY in Atlanta I so wanted that in Charlotte.  While Chuan did not measure up to my experiences in Atlanta it is certainly better than other options I have tried in Charlotte.

Quickly seated and offered the standard Sushi Menu to which I kindly declined and asked for the ""other"" menu I started to browse.  Lots of confusing options so I suggest you ask plenty of questions to which you may or may not get the response you expected.  I knew that I wanted the Szechuan fried chicken with loads of peppers and Szechaun peppercorns, this dish literally numbs your mouth but in a good way!  We also opted for the dry fried green beans which were fine but not near as good as dry fried eggplant which you must try if you find it elsewhere (not available here).  

Great service and overall great experience, I look forward to returning to try more menu items.

E65lOMX0eaphVOvQNfC4gg,8bKpyXdiYF3ZKIB3QyEiVQ,KAyQ07GqrfP1VW5MhxvEHg,2,4,1,2,"I've had Pho Nho sitting in my draft box for a few weeks now, and have been twice since I began.  That makes three, and it's kind of interesting how my thought process went ""4 stars?  3?"" after my 1st experience; ""3 stars? 2?"" after my 2nd, and ""2 stars... 1???"" after my third.

Here are some interesting points:

1)  Their congee is not good.  I'm not particularly surprised, but I thought Vietnamese congee might be a nice switch from my love of traditional Chinese congee.  This wasn't.  It was a flavourless, overcooked take on the Chinese I'm accustomed to.

2)  Their spring rolls are unpredictable.  First time good, second time  too chewy (raw) or over-fried and over-greasy (fried).  We didn't order them a third time.

3)  The ubiquitous rice vermicelli with grilled pork and spring rolls is damned tasty save for the spring rolls.  Improve them, and they've got a winner!  The pork's fantastic!

4)  Shakes are good but not great, kind of middle of the road for TO.

5)  Pho is fine, nothing to write home about, and hits the spot.  The shrimp paste soup is very flavourful, and I was amused when they told me something like ""many of you don't like it"".  I assume white folk.  Maybe I misheard.  I don't take offense to these sorts of comments; rather, I revel in them!

6)  Our third trip, a Friday night after 7pm, it transformed into an obnoxious neighbourhood dive bar full of scum bags and loud talkers / yellers chillin' to the anachronistic grooves of 70s and 80s funk music.  There was also what appeared to be a hooker schmoozing with the construction workers, and our server spent a good 10 minutes talking and joking with her rather than bringing us our bill after we asked for it.

7)  Cash only.  No signs anywhere to indicate this save for hidden behind the ATM they not-so-cheerfully direct you to.  Friendly tip for restaurateurs:  DO NOT TRICK ME INTO USING YOUR STUPID ATM.  I will not be happy to pay your $1.75 service fee.

Anyway, points 6 and 7 make me want to drop the rating to a 1, but I'll resist.  They have some redeeming qualities (decent soup, shakes, and fantastic grilled pork), but not enough to convince us to return any time soon.  I work very close by, so it's likely I'll come for a lunch soup on a rainy day... but other than that, there's far better Viet/Thai options within reasonable distance (Pho Phuong at Dundas W & Lansdowne or Pho Linh at College & Dufferin being our faves...).",2011-10-02 11:40:51

It sort of looked a lot like Yafo Kitchen...which I still prefer by a mile.  Yafo is a lot more elevated with the variety of sides and hand made laffa bread.  Cava is more like a healthy Mediterranean Chipotle, so it should still find its niche.

Located along the strip of restaurants in Market Village, this small restaurant can easily go unnoticed. But it doesn't need a flashy sign in front for people to know because it has been so consistent with what they do, that people keep coming back. And it gets PACKED, so be sure to make reservations prior to coming here over the weekends. 

The Peking Duck prepared and served here is fantastic. Too many times Peking Duck is prepared too oily, too much fat, or too dry. But at Chung King, there is a delicate balance of a crispy outer skin, moist tender duck meat, with a thin layer of fat in between. The steamed wraps that come with the meal is prepared hot and thin, without being too doughy or flour-y. Carefully wrapping the roasted duck, onion strips, cucumbers, and hoi sin sauce together, each bite was bursting of flavour of the succulent meat and the sweetness of the sauce. Goes without saying, everyone was fighting for that last wrap. 

As part of the 2 course Peking Duck meal, we ordered the Minced Duck and Lettuce Wrap. The minced duck was very flavourful and with the lettuce wrap leaves a refreshing texture to all that meat.

We were definitely wrong.  Luckily our curbed expectations led to a very pleasant surprise. (PS - There is nothing wrong Carrabba's)

The inside of the restaurant is very nice, and feels upscale.  Luckily the prices are not 'upscale' in nature for the food or drinks.  The BIG PLUS here is their SERVICE.  It was exceptional.  Everyone was extremely helpful, friendly, and polite.  The service reminded of something you would see at a very nice steakhouse.

For drinks, we tried the Strawberry Lemon Drop  and the Pometini.  Both were delicious, especially the Strawberry Lemon Drop.  My only tiny gripe is that they could have been stronger, but they were not watered down.

In terms of food, we got plenty of their bread, which was warm and delicious, with some kind of olive oil dipping sauce that had a tomato-y taste to it.

For the entree, we tried their Lasagna Coco Pazzo, which is much different (in a good way) than the traditional Lasagna that you would think of.  Great meat sauce and tons of cheese.  Also, a massive portion, so plan on bringing most of it home, especially if you get after it in the bread department.

For some reason, we decided to get a dessert, despite the mass quantities of food consumed 10 mins earlier.  We got the Zeppole, which are mini cinnamon sugar donuts with nutella and ricotta cheese in them. Very tasty, but I could have gone for some dipping sauces...because...why not.

When we saw this place open up, I thought Carrabba's would have competition, but now we are thinking Sullivan's will have to step their game up to keep us from going to Luciano's for a nice meal.",2013-05-09 00:55:02

I ordered a soda and the ""Freaking Hot Wings"". Shannon said they were the hottest ones they had. You can tell a lot about a place by the hot wings they serve. I've had some that were silly hot and tasted awful. No bones about it, these weren't all that hot but had a nice flavor. They were juicy and tender. The sauce they were coated in was tangy without a vinegar after taste. I got a dozen for $10.00 which was a reasonable price. They have quite a few flavors to choose from. Next time I may try another flavor, but I am interested in working my way through the burger menu first.

They scored a 3 in my book as the wings were lacking some serious points on the Schoville index. Just a bit hotter would have suited my taste. I also thought the wait was a little longer than it should have been for just a dozen wings. This won't detour me from a return trip",2017-05-02 22:03:35

It's a bit of a mixed opinion here, but my friends ordered Chinese food at this Vietnamese restaurant (-_-;) and I got conflicting opinions. One guy said that his was awesome, while the other said some of his chicken was uncooked. However, I get fried rice from time to time, and that's done perfectly.

If this is your first time, I suggest starting with the pho tai (#3). If you're THE culinary expert on pho and don't like it, just shut up and eat.

The service for food has always been a bit below par, but you can avoid some of that craziness if you go the bar. The bartenders are younger and typically nice, chatty, and helpful. I'm surprised that a restaurant this upscale can do good business in this part of Oakland, where students typically look for a quick and cheap meal. However, this probably caters to the professionals in the area, and I think this place fits a nice niche in the neighborhood.

This is a large space and if you want to do a big family gathering or party, this would be a great place to do it.  Maybe even an UYE!

The server (I think there are only 1-2 people who typically serve here) is always great and nice.  They're always accommodating if you need to make substitutions, which I appreciate.

Short Leash takes a great American pass time food, the hot dog, and turns it into a dining experience to not miss out on. Their gourmet style hot dogs will thrill your taste buds in the moment and leave you salivating for more after. I am getting Pavlovian just writing this review. 
The dining atmosphere is cozy, the wait staff is very friendly and knowledgable about their products.  There is a small area for bar seating and several tables for larger groups.  The decor is minimalist which adds to the charm.  There is no outdoor seating which is great for the hot summer months. 
I went with some friends and arrived after walking a mile in the 115 degree afternoon sun. The first we ordered was water and lots of it.  Our server was so nice as to not only leave the pitcher of water but brought out two more.  They were all gone by the time our dinner was done.  And she provide waters in Togo glasses after hearing our story when our meal was done. That was great thoughtfulness. 
My friends who had never experienced the food truck were dazzled by all of the options available for a hot dog so they each chose a create your own.  I ordered the Bear because they didn't believe that bacon and peanut butter with crackers could be delicious on a hot dog.  They were eating their words once they had one bite of the deliciousness.  Dave H. ordered the deviled dog and thought it was the most amazing gourmet dog he'd ever eaten.  
If you have never tried the food truck I recommend trying the restaurant you won't be disappointed.

Before you jump in to defend this social class division that I know is equally rife across all areas of pittsburgh. I will just say I have lived in several diverse areas from Rochester ny to salt lake city utah. Most grocery store chains especially the big ones (Wegmans in Ny, Smiths and Harmons) at least made some effort to keep store size and selection consistent through all their locations. With Giant Eagle I get the feeling they are trying to divide people based on income by the items offered in their stores.

Met a couple of Thai coworkers here for lunch.  Ordered side of eggrolls for Mom and friends to enjoy.  She didn't, and they didn't even try.  The Viet food connoisseur/home cook liked the food here, but didn't care for its hygiene reputation (lacking); She just went w/ the ease of location, instead of suggesting a cleaner establishment (she likes Com Tam for pho and Un-Pho-Gettable for rice plates).  Back to the food...

Mom and I split a combination pho.  It'll do.  I also ordered a plate of lemongrass chicken, which Mom and I found very tasty.  The home cook wouldn't try it, and instead told the other, ""if you like that, I can cook some for you.""  O-kay.

Atmosphere is stripped-down-to-bare-essentials, and there's nothing wrong with that, since menu prices reflect this.  What I don't like is having to walk away from dining out smelling like I'VE been doing all the cooking in the kitchen.

Appetizers may appear to be your ordinary mix of salad, Ahi, and shrimp, but the combination of exotic ingredients will dazzle your taste buds.  The House Salad is a sincere treat with roasted mission figs, toasted pine nuts, maytag blue cheese, and finished with an ice wine vinaigrette.  Other appetizers are the sweet, sour, and spicy grilled shrimp, the slow braised short ribs, the berkshire pork belly, and my favorite: the Ahi Tuna Duo.  Dark rum glazed tartare, and coconut seared - this is a unique twist on something you can order at virtually any restaurant in town.  Appetizers range from $7-$15 here.

Entrees feature American favorites such as Grilled Filet Mignon, New York Strip, Colorado Lamb, Organic Irish Salmon, Handmade Fettucini, and crisp skinned black cod.  Prices start at $21 and go up to $42.  I had to have the filet mignon, a rare indulgence which chefs don't always get right.  I was in heaven when I bit into the manchego potate cake with the roasted garlic spinash.  The filet was incredibly juicy and flavorful, topped with the Italian chile butter.

Likely one will have no room for dessert after their sumptuous meal here, but it is worth saving room for the Chocolate Caramel Tartufo or the warm pumpkin cream filled donuts.

The upstairs of the house boasts a lively lounge. Plush couches and pillows are found on the rooftop terrace or Inside.  Every night but Monday night has live music.  Sundays is groovy house music and lots of dancing, courtesy of Dave Matthias.

This place is similar to, but so much better than Hooter's... girls are hotter and the place has style. There is dancing on the bar which can be fun if you're into that. It's a good place to take someone who is college age and just moved here or something. 

It really seems like it should be a good time - it definitely depends on who you are I guess. It also depends on when you go. I suggest weekday afternoon when nobody is there. If you like crowds of horny drunk college dudes though - check it out on a weekend night.

Their food is surprisingly good. The Library has the potential to rate 4 stars... on some nights I'm sure it's a 2. It's one of those places that really depend on the crowd, but it's still a good place to go if you're young and like the most popular music and scream 'woohoo!' for no reason.

WOW, it's right on pace with other great tapas spots like Tapino. You can't beat the mid-century style inside. The atmosphere on a Friday night gets an A+ for its buzz and eccentricity. It was loud, vibrant and most importantly, fun. 

The food was better than I'd expected. I've read so many mixed reviews of this place on Yelp, so I didn't go in expecting the best. I was blown away (though the prices are indeed a bit steep for tapas plates): the harissa chicken was tender, juicy and packed some serious taste with every tiny bite. The marinated flank steak came with an interesting puree of chili oil, cumin, tamarind and some other spices (it was incredibly smoky, and I'm not sure what the source of it was, but it was damn good) and was cooked just right, medium rare and tender as can be. The special of the night, an artichoke dip with slivered almonds, manchego cheese and spices was the highlight of the meal, made even better with grilled flatbreads for dipping pleasure. The sangria was such a pleasant treat that I indulged several times over. Next time I'll just order the pitcher.

I walked up and down McCaul trying to find an entrance to this place.  It turns out that you have to enter the plaza that has a food court in it, and the entrance is inside.

Once I successfully located the restaurant, I met up with a friend, and a peculiar thing happened - there was a 30 minute wait, even though there was an empty table, and the entire upper section was dark and not being used :S.  The hostess then told us that we could sit outside of the restaurant at one of the food court tables, so we decided to do just that.  

I ordered the Hotate Rice - rice bowl topped w/ scallop and egg ($8.99).  Though it was pretty simple, I definitely enjoyed it.  The food in general seems to be pretty simple but good, and cheap (key word).

It's right across from US Airways center, making it a great place to go either before or after you catch a game/show (aka get your drinks cheaper!) They are know for their $5 martini. Yeah, it's $5 and it DOESN'T SUCK!! I got it clean, because some places, getting it dirty is just disgusting. It was ice cold, went down smooth, and did the job well. 

I've also tried a few of their champagne cocktails, because I am a classy broad. The French 75 is very delicious and for a few $$ more, the Celebration is tre chic. Their Old Fashioned is pretty damn good too and strong. I think I will slowly work my way through their other cocktails, starting with their Moscow Mule (yes, they come with the copper cup).

Food wise, I usually go with a small snack platter to balance out my cocktail intake. It's good for 2 people max and comes with a variety of salty meats, cheeses, olives, and nuts. I've also had the milanesa which was really good and big enough to share! Some day when I am feeling extra fancy (aka make a date take me here), I'll try some real entrees. 

Dress code wise, it's all over the map. You'll see people dressed up like they've come from the opera, others like they rolled out bed, and some like they are waiting for their pimp. It's a scene, that's for sure. As for ambiance, the restrooms are trippy. There's no guys/girls, it's a big cluster *bleep* and you kind of feel like you're in a fun house.

We took a cab down since we would be drinking,  I know i'm digressing but cabs are expensive in Toronto from Pape/Danforth to Baldwin was $35 plus tip.  

It was very busy on Friday night around 7 and but we got one of the last tables near the kitchen, after that there was a wait at the door.  I did my usual scan of tables (a lot of large groups).  The lobster special was on every table (2 for 1 for 27.88).  The noodle dishes seemed to be in abundance as well.  Unfortunately we opted for steamed rice and wish we hadn't but next time noodles will be on order.

The order was:

Chicken in black bean sauce
Beef with Chinese Broccoli
2 for 1 Lobster
Tofu and Seafood Hot Pot
Baby Bok Choy w/Garlic
Steamed Riced

The Lobster is the winner in the bunch steamed then wok fried with garlic, ginger & scallions and chopped in portions for easy maneuver with chop sticks.  I loved it!!!  we loved it!!  

All other dishes were good some critiques:  the tofu/seafood hot pot is almost all tofu (tasty though) the seafood consisted of 2 scallops and a smattering of small shrimp.  They should rename it Tofu hot pot and forget the seafood thing.  The Steamed Rice wasn't sticky enough for me.  The Chicken in Black Bean sauce although good wasn't great but better then other restaurants.

My coworkers and I have been there several times before, but this time I realized how their servers just need some basic training on how to properly treat customers. In terms of food, I give them a 3.5 stars, but the service is 1 star and I would recommend everyone to think 2x before going, especially during lunch rush.

We first arrived when the restaurant was still relatively empty, and after we ordered food it started to get packed and the server also started to rush us. After waiting for 10-15mins for our entrée, literally within 5 minutes of getting our food she came to give us our bill! I totally understand if she just left it there and wait for us to pay, but after another 10 mins she came back AGAIN and told each of us ""here's your bill"" as if we're blind that we didn't see it the first time. If this is not a sign to rush us out the door, I don't know what is. Giving us 15 mins to eat our food when it took you 10mins to serve it does not seem like the right way to treat customers.

In addition, we ordered one salsa and one queso for three people as appetizer and we were served 1 portion of chips. That's okay because we thought we could get more. But then we didn't ask for more until the end where she already rushed us to pay the check, and at that point the server said we could not get anymore because it's only for dine in. Thanks for giving us one order of chips for three of us with 2 sauces and not letting us get some more at the end for to-go. Now we have about a whole bowl of sauce left with less than 10 c hips! If only we asked for it before we paid, she could have given it to us..but we'd just pack it to go anyways. So what's the difference?! It's just rude....if you want your restaurant to be more empty during lunch hour, well, your wish came true.

OG post- Initially, I was very excited that a cafe closer in my neighborhood opened up. If I wanted to get some work done, I would usually have to drive a little further, so Jozo was and still is a welcome surprise. 

The interior is intimately lit, but you're still able to study if that's what you're into. They went for the mid-century modern/industrial furniture style. It's very reminiscent of some World Market items I've seen before but that's besides the point. I feel like they put a lot of thought into creating a space that's comfortable/intimate/study-friendly for patrons who are just hanging out with friends or getting some work done.

The service is great. I was given some recommendations as well as a ton of help choosing what drink I would most likely enjoy. Everyone working there are very inviting, friendly, and professional. They explained that if you bring back your glass (the taller ones that is yours to keep), you can get 25 cents off your next purchase. It's a pretty novel idea since the only other place I'm aware of that does something remotely similar is Juice Standard. 

The reason why I gave it 3 stars was because of my drink. I got an almond milk tea with almond milk and boba. The boba itself was chewy on the outside but more firm on the inside. It's not like a consistent chewy texture all the way through which is kind of disappointing. The drink itself also left a chalky texture after every sip which wasn't all too pleasant. I'm wondering if I just tried something that wasn't the popular/specialty things on the menu. 

I plan on coming back to try the coffee and the waffle sticks, so hopefully, my opinion of Jozo will change come my next visit. Overall, the boba was disappointing but I have high hopes for their other drinks & menu items.",2017-04-11 04:08:01

First, finding parking was ridiculous due to Moxies being across the way.  A woman driving around not paying attention almost ran into my car

Once we got inside it was a Starbucks.  Except unlike the ones at Indigo this one was cramped and cluttered.  Boxes of product were strewn across the floor.  The stereotypes were in attendance: two wussy looking metro men with laptops and no Starsbucks product on their table; a bride to be and her friend

We ordered our drinks.  My wife had a cappuccino and I had a mint hot chocolate.  My wife's drink was ready lickity split.  However in my case my hot choc took almost fives minutes to prep.  It would be nice if they had spoons to eat the whipped cream off of the top.

We used to come to Zipps a lot due to good happy hour prices, they have since raised the prices and now it's very difficult to recommend a place that looks the other way in many regards AND isn't very cheap.

First, it's probably not a bad idea to wash your hands after handling a menu anywhere, but wow their menus are dirty. The last two times I have been here my hands were sticky after touching them. Including the last time where I tried hard to only touch it with one finger. The table was only slightly cleaner.

Then the most egregious part of our visit, the tacos. I'll preface with saying that I am far from a taco snob. I enjoy anything from Taco Bell, Del Taco, Salty Señorita, etc. Wow, Zipps has the worst tacos I have ever eaten. You get four tacos, seasoned beef or chicken. I got 2 each.  The chicken and beef meats look almost identical and basically taste the same.

I should have taken a picture. Both are soupy messes that taste like what I imagine what dog food taste like. I hated typing those words because it sounds mean and sensationalizing, but it's true. The corn tortillas buckled under the load of the soupy, gross mixture that tasted like it's been sitting in a soup container waiting to be delivered to a poor unfortunate soul.

The tacos come with sour cream (which I luckily got on the side) and diced tomatoes which added to the mushy mess.  There was no cheese, lettuce or anything else on the tacos. But I did find large pieces of lettuce UNDER the tacos in the basket. Likely from a salad mix.

Luckily we got sweet potato chips which did offer texture and a pleasant taste.",2015-02-17 06:18:53

The IPA was ""British style"" which means it doesn't go overboard with the hops.  Not bad but served too cold.

The thick and rich, gravy-like broth, was extremely salty and offended our taste buds. Although I preferred the spicy miso ramen over the tonkotsu shoyu, they were both incredibly heavy and beyond rich. The bowl and noodles were piping hot, but the broth was just warm. 

We couldn't finish our bowls and left about 65% of it back (noodles and broth). After our dinner, our stomachs had a hard time digesting the richness and we felt a little nauseous. We could of shared one bowl of ramen, it was super filling and we had a ton of leftovers. 

This is the first time I've ever regretted adding extra toppings on my ramen. The toppings didn't enhance or compliment our ramen. It all got lost in the thick salty broth. Plus the topping choices were rather boring, the best had to of been: corn, kimchi, and nitamago (flavored egg) - the kimchi was fresh and flavorful and they have perfected their soft-boiled egg!

Here's what we ordered: 
Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen with thin noodles (I didn't care for these noodles) and 2 slices of chashu (and with all of the extras):
+dried seaweed - pretty boring
+corn - I loved the corn's sweetness and texture 
+nitamago (flavored soft boiled egg)- perfect! 
+mustard leaf - mushy and flavorless
+shredded green onion - adds nice texture and freshness
+butter - this ramen doesn't need more richness! 
$12.45 

Spicy Miso Ramen with thick wavy noodles (the best noodles!) and 2 slices of thin chashu (and with all of the extras):
+dried seaweed - boring
+corn - great!
+nitamago (flavored egg) - great! 
+mustard leaf - boring and mushy
+shredded green onion - adds freshness
+butter - this ramen does not need more richness! :x
$13.75

Side of extra chashu $2.50 - super fatty and buttery. 

Side of Kimchi $1 - very fresh and flavorful. 

Small pork belly bowl $3.95 - this was my favorite. The pork belly was tender, buttery, and rich in flavor. The rice was cooked perfectly and the green onion and sweet pickled ginger added perfect freshness to the rice bowl.

Thai Basil is another one of the many restaurants taking my money in this busy little downtownish area my job is in.  I was in the mood for something Asian and this came up in mapquest.  
One thing that I like about any place is if they have their up to date menu on the web.  Even the most humble website can make things better for any restaurant.  And they have one.  (and since I just found out that this is a popular chain, they'd BETTER have one)
Looking over their menu, I saw typical downtown prices ($7-$9) and a LOT of variety.  

They've got curry, rice, noodle, and stir-fry dishes.  Appetizers are not many, but what they offer seems to be some quality stuff - the Fried Tofu definitely has me interested.
As for my dish, Pad See Ew, it was prepared to my liking (no carrots or cabbage).  See, I had a buddy back in Michigan who would make Pad See Ew for me at his old restaurant...nothing will ever come close to it.  However, this was not a bad go.  All the ingredients were there - egg, broccolli, the egg noodles, and beef.  All of it was notably fresh; no limp broccolli, tasteless onions, or questionable beef.  In fact, the beef was really tender and tasty on its own.
I do have 2 gripes about the dish.  The sauce is not the best and the onions were a little undercooked.  With the sauce, there was a slight before and aftertaste that didn't sit right.  And as for the onions, they weren't undercooked to the point where they tasted raw...just not as done as I like.
But the dish was overall pretty darn good.  I'd order it again.
The place itself is in the little plaza type thing that's on over here.  Its next to Starbucks so its a pretty busy spot.  I went during lunch peak time so there were no tables available (only like 8 in the first place), but there are a few nice places to sit outside in front of and around the place.  
Nice ambience with all the chit-chat and people coming and going.
Service?  Well there was a hello and goodbye.  They were quite busy, so there was no time for weather chat.  I must point out that every single employee acknowledged me and said hello.  So that gets an automatic star right there.
So far good food, nice joint, dedicated service, but a $40 a day type price.  Thai Basil is worth keeping a menu handy.  I will be back.

We had friends join us (been there before with us) and we were looking forward to our teppanyaki dinner together!  The entire evening pretty much went from bad to worse.  Once seated at a table, it took FOREVER to get drinks.  We finally flagged someone down and you would have thought we were asking them to do us a favor.  The drinks came and we sat and sat.  Finally a Server came over and asked us if we wanted appetizers - we ordered.  They were actually very good.  All of us sat with empty glasses and, once again, had to flag down the Server and asked for another round.  Umberto, our favorite Chef walked by and we waved and asked him if he was cooking for us and he said yes - we were very happy!  For whatever reason, he did not our Chef.  A nice young man came and started cooking the meal.  We had to, once again, flag down the Server and inquire on whether they were bringing the soup and salad.  He said yes - went to get them and brought out both at the same time!  Ridiculous.  Both couples ordered NY Steak and Prawns.  We all ordered our steak medium rare - it was terrible, NO taste and overcooked.  The prawns were ok.  When he gave us the vegetables, they were overcooked and no taste.  We ALWAYS look forward to the fried rice, it was so tasteless, we ALL left most of what was in our bowl.

The only thing better than the food was the service.  The waitresses and hostesses are so friendly and personable that you feel like you don't want to leave!!!  That is how you do it.  Zinburger is a great place with a great vibe and this is one of my Phoenix Fav's.

Get the chicken sandwich with Franks Hot Sauce and tell em Attorney Steve sent you!

PS.  Our waitress was Kira, ask for her.....she is simply the best!

When I got there, there were 2 other people in the restaurant and the waiter, understandably was telling them they could only order take out as it was so close to closing time. 
Of course, I was crest fallen. I mean, I was STARVING!!!  It was a busy day- the last time I had something in my stomach was before noon- and now, I have to have take out and eat the noodles in a darkened parking lot inside my car?!?!
What's a girl to do in a situation like this?  I pulled out my best sad puppy eyes and my best Chinese!!!!  And I asked them if I could PLEASE eat the noodle soup inside the restaurant. I think it was the Chinese that did the trick as they were surprised this banana spoke Chinese!!!!
Ha!  You can bet this bowl of noodle soup was the best tasting one I had ever had!!!!! Oh so tasty and satisfying for my growling empty stomach!!!!!
Yes, be impressed as I ate furiously away at my noodle soup while 3 people watched me, waiting to close. And I finished my bowl of lamb noodle soup, noodle style D in slurping 15 mins so I was belly full satisfied by 9:30pm closing time.  That's right, fastest noodle eating ever!!!!

She wanted something much more casual and breakfast lol. What better place than the Peppermill. I was a bit caught off guard because I haven't been to this place in YEARS! I forgot how good it was. When we arrived it wasn't even busy and we were able to be seated immediately! The hostess was very friendly and helped us find a big enough table for 6 including a chair to sit my baby niece in. I also forgot how cool the ambiance of the place was with the neon lights and old school diner style tables. The outfits of the employee's are so cute it's so funny to see them walking around especially the cocktail or beverage girls. Not quite sure what they are called officially but either way it's cute! 

Like many have already raved about.. HUGE PORTIONS! I checked the pictures on Yelp prior to arrival and I had my taste buds fixed on one of these crazy big omelette's. It was more so in the evening dinner kind of time and I thought it was funny that my family all was in the mood for breakfast food. Except my nephew (teenager) just had to be different and get a sandwhich lol. Anyways let's get to this food! Yum!

Friend arrived in town with a recommendation for Ferraro's. I had been here for happy hour before and had no complaints, so we thought we'd try dinner.

The service was very very bad. We were greeted by a grump and it all went downhill from there. We had to go to the bar to get our water glasses refilled - more than once. The waiter took our order, our desert order and brought the tab. Other than that, we never saw him. For our party of six, we were brought two spoons for the creme brûlée desert, which we had informed our waiter we would be sharing. There was no inquiry as to whether any after dinner drinks were desired. We got up to find additional spoons on other tables.

Fine dining, this is not.

Now to the food. It was absolutely flavorless. And we had to get up to find salt and pepper in an attempt to make it edible.

The tomatoes in the Caprese salad were not even ripe. The ""Cesar"" salad dressing was blah. We actually all left food on our plates and that is a rarity for this group.

The two highlights were the grilled octopus appetizer and the pesto dipping oil for the bread. (We drizzled that stuff all over everything so we could eat it.)

Their menu has plenty of standards, but also some food I have never seen elsewhere.  I had an eggplant salad with chicken tomatoes and hardboiled eggs.

Let's start with the good. The three stars are for the Pad Kee Mao and the BBQ Chicken. I salute you for these dishes. The noodles were not oily at all and the spice was spot on. The BBQ Chicken rocked my world even after I removed the skin it still had such intense flavor.

The chicken even looks bangin'.

Now for the bad and the ugly. 

1. UNINVITED GUEST: We saw two spiders crawling on the table. One on a plate and the other just pimp walking across the table. I hate to put a beautiful restaurant such as Gaati on blast, but HELL NO I don't want spiders skinny dipping in my food. Even if it is extra protein. How do you say no bueno in Thai? Now add the eff word and that's what I'm sayin'.

2. BELOW TO AVERAGE DISHES:  Back to the food. I also sampled the Green Curry which had zero flavor and runny sauce. The Pad Thai and Tom Kha were mediocre and the Red Curry had too much going on at once. The spices seemed to be playing Fight Club in my mouth. Yeah, yeah. I know, I'm not suppose to talk about Fight Club. Bite me.

3. PRICES: Gaati is overpriced. If the food made me fall in love I wouldn't be complaining. But, it didn't. Add the spiders to the mix and I think the shit should be free. 

Plain and simple I will not be returning.  Just because the restaurant is visually attractive and the service was average doesn't mean the food is going to completely stimulate my taste buds. Especially when there are bugs involved.  

In a dance off Gaati Thai doesn't stand a chance against other Thai restaurants in town. It can't even hear the beat and it might only have one leg with a webbed foot and a throbbing bunion. It can't stand on that leg, period.

We decided to go with the chocolate fudge and pistachio cheesecakes. Biting into the best part of the cheesecake a.k.a, the tip of the cheesecake was really smooth and velvety. The crust at the bottom was fairly good and the cheesecake was in quite a large portion in my opinion, but the price made up for it (you're looking at $6 to $7 per slice). The chocolate fudge was definitely more filling than the pistachio, which was lighter. Overall, the cheesecake was good.

I just had to change my rating 5 stars to 3 because I was try calling them to make reservation to take family birthday dinner (because we have group of 8) and a girl on the phone didn't want to take it.  Called at 6:45p reservation for 7:30p and she claimed they don't take because they're closing at 9pm on Sunday.  I asked if they were busy (if so that would be more understandable) but she said no.

Well, I'll say it was easy to sign in and the front foyer area was nice. The hostess wasn't overly friendly but not mean, just ok. We've had a lot of really passionate hosts that love this..that's not the vibe. She took us to the room a little early and tells us that once we enter the code to finish...the front door we came in won't open--we would exit out a door on the other side-so remember that she says. Ummm ok yeah well that didn't happen...I'll get to that in a minute. 
My family of 5 started the game and we realize the first lock wasn't even locked. Then, my son opens a wall...that wasn't supposed to open until we had done something else...and this set a bunch of other things off out of sequence and made it a little illogical. We had 5 different clues that were never utilized....I'm sure it was something not set up properly like the locks and wall....
When we finished the game we put the code in as instructed and waited at the other side by  locked door, a different girl named jasmine a comes in and she is definitely not happy, she sounds like she just woke up or she's ready to go to bed...and she's like ohhhh, um did you guys put the code in here? Hmmmm well aren't you watching? Aren't you supposed to know this crap? She doesn't seem interested in if we had a good time she doesn't ask us if we have any questions she just tells us that the door we think we need to use is not the door and to follow her and she would take our photo. Have you ever seen someone stoned out of their mind with II expression? That's jasmine a. 
She takes our photo and hands us her card and leaves. 
I went to the desk to ask what she said as she handed us this card, I swear I heard something about a discount for coming back and it doesn't seem like they have it together. 
We've done 7 rooms in the past few days on two islands of Hawaii...and this was the worst one ever, and the employees are the worst, no once cared. The game was totally spoiled by a room that wasn't set up properly. 
I don't know how this got such high ratings. Ok so the web site says no gaming under the influence, how about no hosting while high or setting up rooms for your customers while high. Totally ruined it. 
DONT DO IT!! 
From a tech standpoint, low tech. Not a lot of bells and whistles and I like the bells and whistles...especially when they are all priced the same,

Choose your meat and choose your vegetable.  That is how great this place is.

They give you plenty of shrimp sauce (glorified mayonnaise sauce) and plenty of food.  I usually don't care for cooked carrots but this place does them well enough that I enjoy them.

I usually get mushrooms or broccoli with beef.  I wish they had more onions in there (either mixed in the fried rice or with your meat).  I haven't asked for extra onions yet so that may be on me.

This place is a good size but don't expect to always get a seat during the lunch rush.  It gets crowded and you may end up eating in your car.  No matter how busy it gets they manage to knock out the food faster than people leave their seats.

The rotating/vertical stages are a unique central element that is well utilized throughout the show.  The storyline/plot is linear, unlike some other Cirque shows.  I do admit to reading Wikipedia afterwards to understand some of the intricacies (""Oh, THAT'S what they were trying to show!"")

Favorite parts: the sparkly long-haired guy (fairy prince?) swinging around and the dreadlocked pole fighter jester/bodyguard guy, especially when he's doing the shadow puppets with the prince.

The theater is exceptionally cool looking, and the pre-show ""scary warriors"" are not as stupid as the two clowns at O.  The theater's snack and beverage bars are combined (unlike O's), so the lines can be long for a bag of popcorn and a water, but the bartender-cashiers are exceptionally fast and professional.  There isn't a full gallery exhibition, but they do have a collection of Ka costumes and a few pre-show musicians/performers out in the theater lobby outside the snack bar.

I found the humorous bits less boring and obnoxious compared to O's (the beach scene wasn't awful).  Ka has more of an action/martial arts focus compared to O's diving/ballet.

Ka was also a cheaper ticket than O for me.  I also liked that I could pick up my ""Will Call"" ticket at the Concierge instead of waiting in the box office line, though I don't see why MGM uses Ticketmaster for O but physical tickets for Ka, unless it's a money saving thing.",2016-02-02 03:24:12

Tai Pan is just off center street NE right across the street from Tire Craft in a little shopping mall called The Madison. There's a decent sized parking lot which is nice, otherwise if that's full just park on the street across the road and walk over.

We arrived Saturday just before noon and we didn't have to wait or anything. When we got seated, more and more people rolled in. We ordered tea and were handed a dim sum sheet.

I took a picture of most of the things we ordered, rice crepes, pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, taro/turnip/chestnut cake, bbq pork/chicken and egg yolk buns, Chinese beef balls, chicken feet, black bean spareribs, sticky rice wrapped in banana leaf, other dumplings - we ordered a nice variety.

I love dim sum anywhere so this was good - I found that the portions a little bigger than some other places as they offer four pieces of some things while some places offer three.

The first time I met him was over ten years ago when I was just making it in this town.  I had reached my goal for my office and in celebration, I took some of my friends and biggest cheerleaders there to celebrate.  T's food went right to my g-spot and I had an orgasmic reaction right there at the table.  
I saved T for special occassions.  The next time I went was again for some celebratory occassion with some friends and once again, T's food went right to my g-spot and I had another orgasmic reaction.
The third time, I've been spoiled so I was secretly rubbing my legs together under their pristine table linen in anticipation and didn't care who saw me as I licked every delectable morsel off of my plate and fingers, groaning with pleasure.
With gloating praise of T., I got a group of friends together for a private dining experience at the Delano Room (min. $500 spending) for a holiday dinner this past Christmas.  When making the reservation, the lady was a bit snubby which I can accept when I am anticipating another orgasmic experience.  
We gather for a evening of fine dining . . . except this time, T. had performance anxiety and failed me.  First the waitress looked like she was overworked and coming into the Delano Room was an inconvinence to her because she has just way too many tables outside that were more important to her.  When my dish came, it had been under the heat lamp for so long that it was completely shriveled that I could not tell what dish I had ordered.  I gave her one look and without a word, she took the dish back and asked me if I would like to order another dish.  Where my g-spot was left high and dry was when we got the bill, the antipasto dish that the waitress had recommended we ordered as a 3-person portion was a whopping $45 per plate.  She had said that ""some"" additional amount would be added for a larger portion- she neglected to clarify that it would be a whopping 3x's the amount.  And we had 2 plates of those . . . $90 for 2 antipasto plates??  
So what was supposed to be my most savory experience with T. was completely anticlimatic and totally blemished my memory of him.

The food is absolutely delicious with a truly varied menu. 

A note about ordering: So you order each burger individually by size (3 oz = slider, 6 oz = regular burger, 9 oz = GIANT burger). I order 3 different 3 oz sliders without any substitutions or additions: the Beef, the Short Rib, and the Sloppy Joe.

Al three were yummy. My favorite for a traditional slider was the Beef and my favorite in terms of flavor was the Short Rib. 

I also ordered some regular tots to share and those were TOO good. They were fried to perfection. So good I ate way, way too many. 

They also had tons of healthy options (hey, this is Old Town) so don't fret if your friends want to head to Stax and you're not feeling the carb heavy, deep fried lunch that day.

You obviously can't compare it to the huge selection of board and card games at Snakes & Lattes but games at Utopia are still decent to play. This cafe also has mahjong, poker and darts to play, which makes up a bit for the difference in game selection.

House rules requiring every guest purchasing food or drinks every few hours are very reasonable considering that they make money off that to stay open. It feels almost as if their business exists because they simply want people to have fun and not because they're trying to make a lot of money.

A little bit of paint could make this place more inviting.   

Anyway, I finally went in hoping to find some tropical fruits because I can't find them anywhere else in the valley like I do in L.A.

It's tolerable if you're not walking around on an empty stomach but it (the odor) tends to be the strongest in the produce section.  Good selection of produce. Most of it looks good.  Somewhat pricey.  

Not the store I would do my weekly grocery shopping at as far as milk and eggs, and etc but they have what you can't find elsewhere.  Big selection of seafood too.  Haven't tried it so I can't tell you how it is but it looks okay.  They carry A LOT of products you don't see anywhere else so a BIG PLUS.  Lots of products from Lanitoamerica.  Huge selection of trusted GOYA products.  Their freezer sections have a good variety of items not found in AZ or the US for that matter, too.

I had a black bean burger. It came with avacado and sprout people! Sprouts. It was as big as my head. Gid had a double patty with cheese and bacon he had to walk away from. He couldn't finish it.

 Everything was very good. My one complaint was my veggie burger could have been a little thinner or spicier.  It was a little bland, but the consistency of my burger was good and homemade. Usually veggie burgers are a kiss of death next to the word homemade. This was not. Next time I will order it  with extra avacado and some hot sauce on the side.

When you walk inside of the restaurant you can't help but notice the Pittsburgh theme, because everywhere you look there's something about Pittsburgh.  

A nice young lady (Randy's daughter) gave us a menu at the counter and took our order.  The menu was fairly simple and straightforward.  Not being a hotdog fan I opted to try some of the menu items that I've heard other people raving about, including the barbecue pulled pork sandwich, macaroni and cheese and a Steel City Slider.  And no, I didn't eat all of it!  It was way too much food, but I wanted to try so many things!

From the first bite of the macaroni and cheese I was in heaven.  Although the presentation wasn't the best (the food is served on styrofoam plates) the food was absolutely delicious.  The mac n cheese was creamy, with just the right amount of bite.    The pulled pork sandwich was wonderful too.  The bread was fresh and soft, the meat had been slow cooked in Freddy G's BBQ Sauce.  I say the name brand because you'll want to remember that name.  This sauce was amazing.  It had a little spice to it, but not too much.  The coleslaw was freshly made and crisp.  And lastly the slider was awesome as well.  I'm a big fan of shaved ham and this was perfectly cooked.

Being that I am living in a mountain town in the middle of nowhere at the moment, lol, getting good Japanese is not very likely to say the least. So I was looking forward to having some great cuisine.

Katsuya is a very open space, with a large bar in the middle and the casino of the SLS is in plain view. Even that being the case, by the time we got there it was fairly vacant and not at all noisy. We were seated right away, ordered promptly, and within a few minutes our plates started to come in at a good pace

We started with some pan fried pork dumplings, and crispy cauliflower. Both of these were fantastic. Then followed our main course, which was the Fried Rice with A5 Wagyu, the Wagyu Ribeye, and a Sunset roll. Now a lot of places like to advertise wagyu steak, but don't really taste any different then a prime steak. So here I would say is the first time I tried what I imagine is an authentic wagyu steak. 

The ribeye just melted in your mouth and was cut into pieces with a spoon, almost like steak jello but with just enough bite to still eat like steak. That might not be an appetizing way of describing steak, but I can assure you it was delicious. It also came with grilled onion rings that were a nice touch.

The fried rice was excellent, and the wagyu steak that came with it was equally delicious but with a different texture than the ribeye. It was cut into cubes with a seared outside but soft middle. Really good stuff!

The Sunset roll was also great. I am not a big sushi guy myself (my girlfriend is), but I enjoyed it thoroughly. Dessert was delicious, and overall just a great meal. Would definitely come back.",2017-02-21 18:56:08

On Friday, I had to run a quick errand in the area, and popped in for lunch. Service was pretty fast. Picked up a delicious ham and swiss sandwich on multigrain bread. 

Everything came out as ordered, and relatively quick. Very tasty. The meat wasn't slimy, the cheese was perfect, and the veggies were crisp and delicious. Just a hint of mustard. It was the kind of sandwich that made my afternoon. 

Also, I got a free chocolate chip cookie. Everyone gets one. Usually I get free stuff because I am quite the charmer, but you can feel special here. The staff is very nice. Friendly.

The Iced Tea selection is pretty cool too!

My lunch was a touch on the pricey side. About nine bucks. Oh well. Who cares. At least it was worth it.

The drinks are so tasty and they don't offer a small size so I am forced to drink a big, yummy drink! Haha. Okay, so it's not really a bad issue, but I wish they did have three sizes instead of two, especially for the ice blended drinks. Usually they're too much for me to drink and I end up throwing away part of it.

This particular Coffee Bean location is in The District and has a lot of outdoor seating. There are also misters, which make for a nice place to sit and enjoy the late afternoon/early evening, even in Vegas, if it is not too hot in the summer. 

Honestly I don't think they're any better or worse than Starbucks. They're just kind of an alternative. Yes, the drinks do taste a bit different, but not so much so that I would pick one over the other for which one I like better. Although Coffee Bean does have less of that big corporation vibe.

I've never had an issue with service here. All the employees have been quite nice and tend to be on the younger side.

AND Coffee Bean does a promotion for U.S. Soldiers to get them coffee. I don't know if they do it on a rotating basis or what, but two or three times I've been in this particular Coffee Bean they have offered customers the chance to purchase a bag of coffee beans for soldiers.

I LOVE the cafe.  It is larger than it looks, and I love the digital tvs showing the worldwide sights.  The prices can't be beat.  I was in there just before Thanksgiving, and there was a flyer on the table advertising their turkey day menu.  It was $6.52 per person for a FULL dinner.  How amazing is that?!  I don't think I have ever had the same server twice, but everyone is very friendly and prompt.  They offer a great selection on their menu.  The special on weekends is usually prime rib.  Once again (as in my Eldorado review), it is not the biggest, best cut of meat, but it is always cooked perfectly and very delicious.  It comes with your choice of potato and a veggie.  My Mom is a big fan of the patty melt, which is really good.  The bread is buttery and toasted and the sandwich is served with a side of fries.

Parking can be tight, as there is one small lot in front of the casino, and then street parking on Water St.  But if you get lucky, maybe you'll grab a spot.  :)",2011-12-03 01:57:49

All kidding aside, we had great service and the space is light and airy. I like the space. And um, who knew there was Venezuelan food in TO? 

WE ATE 
They have some pretty awesome combos here - arepa of the day + beer for $12 so I got the carne mechada -shredded flank steak, tomato, garlic, pepper, cumin - wrapped in two pieces of dense corn bread paired with MIll Street Organic. My dining companion had the vegetarian arepa. Not my cup of tea to be honest.

The steak lacked flavour and it was a good 3 portions of meat. So yes, hearty, but no to lack of toppings. And the hot sauce is HOT. Like mouth-on-fire, get me a glass of milk stat hot. Caution on the hot sauce. As much as I wanted to love the food I was not impressed. 

My friend seemed to like her vegetarian one but the consensus was this was a lot of food, even though it doesn't look like it. 

I topped it off with an alfajore. It was nice but I think I was in the mood for something more chocolatey.

What I was served was: sparse ground beef, frozen mixed vegetables thrown in an overly salty sauce topped with processed whipped potatoes. I know they were frozen mixed vegetables because I really don't think corn is typically used in cottage pie...

I was pretty excited to come here because I rarely eat Asian cuisines. Usually I am a pho person and nothing more, unless it's sushi, which sometimes in the good 'ol U. S. of A. you can't really even consider the type of sushi served actual sushi per Japanese standards. With the being said, launch into my review.

Food - My friend and I shared the Octopus Balls and the Poki. Immediately I was overtaken by the saltiness of the poki dish. Just too much. Octopus balls were a nice treat and actually had a decent amount of meat in them

Both my friend and I ordered the Tan Tan Men Ramen. This was my first time having ramen. I thought it was decent. The noodles were good, but it wasn't too spicy to me anyway, until I happened to get a bit of the broth in my eye. Yes, go me. Broth in the eye. Overall the taste was not totally satisfactory, but I don't have much to go off of. I believe now I will branch out and try some ramen elsewhere, just to see how Shuseki's stacks up.

Service - Meh, meh, meh. Although our server arrived to our table quickly to take our orders and bring food he was non-existent for most of the time. My water glass sat unfilled for quite awhile while I was really wanting some water. 

My Restaurant.com GC was met with some speculation when we were ready to pay our bill. I was just getting ready for a confrontation, but then the server whisked away my debit card and the GC. When he came back he had charged my debit card an additional $4.43 for ""included tip"" which I was not told would be included. Um, what? We were only a part of two. Pretty sure the ""tip included"" part came because we had used the gift certificate. If it's the restaurant's policy to include tip along with gift certificate's they should include that on the GC. But my GC said nothing of a tip being included and I've used Restaurant.com quite a bit and I have never had this happen to me before.

The $4.43 tip was annoying and the fact that they did not bother to tell me I would be charged a tip prior to running my card was even more annoying. It is not okay to charge someone more just because you feel like it and especially if there is nowhere on the menu, in the restaurant, or on my GC that says I will be charged.

Considering I *was* going to leave a tip for $5 the server got shorted. I'm guessing the restaurant does this because they might assume people who use gift certificates may leave poor tips. I am not one of those people and I think it's poor business to assume everyone who comes through your door are cheap-asses. Also, if Shuseki put out the gift certificates they are obviously trying to get business in the door. Unfortunately for them and their assumptions regarding myself - I will not be back.",2013-05-15 16:57:31

I went for lunch shortly after 2pm today and the restaurant was at approximately 75% capacity, leading me to believe that the lunch rush must have been sheer chaos. Insane for their 2nd day back in business. 

Is it is as good as before? Yes and No. I ordered the legendary Thai Islamic Noodles 5 Chili and my guest the Chicken Panang mild. My noodles were just as I remembered them, the same silky smooth pink coco sauce with crunchy veg and a fair amount of protein. The portion however seemed to be smaller, maybe by 10-15%. Price of the TIN is now $10.00 flat. Is it worth it? Yes, but it has steadily gone up over the past 12-13 years that I have been visiting Sking, it's as if the price of this dish increases in correlation to that of cigarettes. 

The flavour of the chicken panang sauce was outstanding and just as good as it used to be, however it was way too runny. The consistency was closer to soup and it should have been reduced way more, definitely not as runny as it used to be. The rice accompanying the panang was also in the shape of a pyramid, kinda. The entire base of the pyramid was crumbling and it simply did not look professional by any means. I could also see many other shotty pyramids passing by as staff delivered other patrons orders.  Rice portions dropped between 15% and 20% as well. Not cool 

Layout and decor of the new King is solid. Bigger and better bathrooms then before, and also an escalator to bring you to the main floor should you be unable to do so by yourself. Another great addition are the individual wooden chairs with baskets underneath, very helpful especially if you are carrying a purse or satchel (Indiana Jones carried one).

After the complimentary bread with olive oil (but no fresh parmesan offered), I ordered the hearty minestrone soup and the veal chop parmesan. 

Minestrone soup had a better broth than my recent outing at Milo in Olive in Santa Monica -- and at the same price.

The veal chop parmesan was incredibly taxing to the wallet, and served a la carte, but thankfully my uncle was paying for it. 

I however, falsely assumed that this dish came with a side of pasta, but that was the CHICKEN PARMESAN, NOT VEAL. At nearly fifty dollars though, most Italian restaurants throw in a complimentary pasta side, and with Allegro this should be no exception considering the Las Vegas Strips premium for fine dining.

If it's your first visit, your server will probably take you down memory lane during your welcome, as they did with us on this visit. The Mansion has housed some of the most iconic Toronto families including the Masseys and the McMasters. To add to the intrigue, the women's washroom is said to be haunted as a lady passed away in there some years ago. Even if you aren't really that interested in the history lesson, the Mansion is really a sight to behold. There's a huge staircase leading up from the foyer to the second floor which makes for some great pictures as I saw many guests taking advantage of that night. I was seated in the front room which has luxurious mantle and many marble details. It was also decorated for Christmas which  added to the great atmosphere. Just the story and the ambiance makes it a great location for a date.

On this occasion I had the portobello mushroom burger. The burger title is really misleading as it's definitely a sandwich in every way. The bread that was used was a ciabatta bun, was cut down the middle for easy eating and presented as a sandwich. This was a little surprising but there were no other surprises regarding the fillings as described. The sandwich was cold though so definitely the opposite of what I was expecting from a burger.  This entree comes with a choice of side and I opted for a Caesar salad which was good. It was dressed lightly with ample parmesan shavings and croutons. All in all the dish was fine. 

The highlight was actually the appetizer. The baked garlic shrimp is served in the dish that they use for the escargot. This leaves perfect little pockets of cheese and oil to dip the bread in. It's extremely savoury, definitely unhealthy but really good.

Let me just cut to the chase, like many ""ethnic"" places on Queen West, this place seems designed for a western palate and not in a good way.  The Chana Masala and Eggplant dishes I tried were mediocre.  You honestly could find better Indian food in a food court.  

Maybe I've just been exposed to real indian food in TO burbs and other countries during my travels but this place was just a major let down.  I couldn't go to bed at night giving this place any more than 2 stars.",2014-01-20 23:51:34

I scanned the burgers and was excited to see that all burg options can substitute a portobello mushroom or chicken.  Since I'm a huge fan of the bello I decided to go the meatless route and choose the Adventureland Burgher.  Included is slaw, a mysteriously sauce dubbed untouchable, pickles and onion crisps.  I ventured into this burger like I was on the run from some wild bears.  I was as ravenous as those creatures are!

I felt as if I would have done a disservice by not getting a beer (dah, Bocktown BEER).  The first option on the list screamed my name, the Lancaster Milk Stout infused with coconut.  Yinz guyz know I love coconut!  It was thick yet refreshing with a hint of coconut.  Hit.the.spot!

Topped with Pepperoni and Special Herbs and Spices), a soft drink, and a beer. Our total was about $24. 

I did see a special for one large item pizza, bread sticks, and tokens (I forget how many tokens) for $19.99 that I wanted to try for the video games, but my boyfriend warned me that their games were lame these days. I went and looked and behold, all of the cool arcade games have been replace with lame ticket machine games! I then realized how old I have become and even things at Peter Piper Pizza change over time.

The pizza was yummy. I asked for parmesan and the girl who gave me my pizza pointed into a sea of people and tables. I walked that way, saw where I think there were supposed to be bottles of it, and didn't find any. I waited until I found an empty table that people had already left to snag one. For a Saturday this location was not very busy, so I think they need to put out more parmesan. The pizza was hot and tasty, the beer was flat though.

As one of the first poke places to come to Toronto I had high expectations, especially since sampling a couple of different places in the area. I ordered their signature bowl, the 420, since it had salmon and tuna (yum). I was then given the choice of including a few extra toppings as well, I went with my usual: seaweed salad and edamame. 

Upon first glance, I was really impressed with the amount of food they were able to pack into a single bowl (about the same as Poke Guys) and how they included kale as well instead of the usual mixed greens but the price! After tip, my bowl was $18 which makes it the most expensive poke bowl I've ever ordered to date. 

Sadly, I had to wait until I got back to work until I could sample some of it so the fish, while still fresh, was more on the soggy side. The ponzu lime sauce gave it a refreshing taste though. The rice was a bit too al dente for my taste but all in all, it was quite filling and I was only able to finish about half of it.

I came on the day when they were still having there 2 day promo which was get 2 large drinks for $8.85. I got the Royal 9 with full sugar because the girl was telling me what kind of ingredients they put in what not, so what hell?! Let's try something new. First sip of the milk tea, it was pretty damn good. Most interesting thing is that even though they put in full sugar, it didn't taste at all sweet! 

I was pretty surprised as I never get full sugar for any of the bubble teas I get just because it usually comes out to be extremely sweet. I don't have that tolerance unfortunately. The Alley, promotes natural flavor bubble tea which means they do not use any powders or artificial ingredients and is strictly all natural and with legit tea ingredients. 

I personally, really like the taste and quality of the bubble teas. I had tried this other drink which tasted very much just like tea with full sugar added again but it didn't taste sweet either and only thing I could taste is the tea flavor. They also brew their own tapioca! and they have different flavors too! This place definitely brings bubble tea to another level, a more a quality level than compared to other shops. I suppose I have been spoiled by Chatime for so long until this place popped up. The price for these drinks are very competitive to other bbt shops as well, priced almost the same. Around $4.75 - $5 but you're getting a much better drink compared to other places. 

So it depends on your preference on what you like, for me I actually really like this place now more than the rest. I need to come back again to try more drinks.

Anyway I waited in line for the framing section which was 2 people deep but it moved quickly.

We ordered a few appetizers. First let me say this, I couldn't believe they charge almost $8 for 4 fried eggrolls with lettuce. This is the highest I have seen for this anywhere in my life and I was immediately turned off. That is just highway robbery. So we ordered the 2 individual ones and they were alright. Not bad, but not the worse. Just okay.

We also ordered the garlic chicken wings which are deep fried chicken wings covered in this amazing sauce. This was hands down the best thing we ate. I mean it was delicious.

My 4 year old son loves pho but with broth and noodles only. They didn't have a kid option and they charged me $8.00 for a bowl of noodles and broth. I repeatedly asked for noodles and broth only, no onions, no cilantro but of course it came out with all onions and cilantro. If you are making me pay $8 for a bowl of noodles and hot water, you can at least bring it the way I asked.

I ordered a bowl of bun bo hue for myself and it was lacking serious flavor. It was too oily and with the lack of flavor, I was mad at myself for even ordering it. I asked for shrimp paste to try to help give the broth some flavor and instead they brought me chili oil. I get it, they probably didn't expect me to ask for shrimp paste but at least listen to me and don't assume that I don't know what I am asking for. They finally brought it out and while it helped the soup some, it couldn't save it.

So I ordered for myself, thinking to start slow with what I can handle- 1 roll and nigiri and a tempura. Others followed suit with their orders- some not holding restraint on their orders and most are ""roll happy"". So rolls started to come out....I found mine and happily ate it...then more rolls and more rolls that everyone else ordered. A few nigiri made it, but none were the pieces I ordered....only the basic, tuna, salmon etc someone else ordered...maybe 12 pieces and thats all we saw the whole night. So many rolls kept rolling in...so many in  fact that we had to cancel anything else we ordered to get through rolls on our table. A few we couldnt even figure out who the hell ordered it...if any of us ordered it at all!  I had to help everyone else eat their rolls so we dont get charged a la carte. I dont like rainbow rolls- I did not come to eat california roll with some fish on top! There was too much rice to me in the rolls, hence stuffing us all up.  I did not like how they did not pace us or bring each person what they ordered like other AYCE's do. I had no problem at places like Sushi Mon serving us as individuals in a group..and I like that when you order nigiri first then thats what you'll get...they dont ""forget"" the order and skip to the rolls. 

The server didnt look too happy with us too and was crabby serving us- this time I can't blame them. Normally me and my brother had to speak/apologize for the group. Mind you they dont know how to shut up most of them....they're so loud the deaf can hear it...but also we've never had ALL the loud ones in a group dinner with us...it was the complete symphony of cackling gays.  Kinda embarrassing and I apologize if you were there on a night a party of 12 gays were there with me and had to hear their bullshit. If I was any of you, I woulda slapped all of us. 

It was just not a pleasant night at all and though my friends are asses, if the staff served like other AYCE's did we wouldnt have had problems with being roll overwhelmed. 

I still cant get near anything with crab or I gag and this was months ago.

We ordered some wine and beer, great wine by the glass selection and tap beer selection as well.  They had Peroni on tap which was a nice touch.  The space is really nice, we loved the design inside and were sad it was too windy to sit outside.  It looked so nice and fun with big screen tvs and a huge electric fireplace.  They have a bunch of magazines at the front door, which could be cool if you are dining alone.  

We had a salad with green beans and asparagus with a truffle vinaigrette.  This was great.  The pizza we ordered with a new york crust had sausage and eggplant on it.  It was very tasty.  All in all the food was probably a 5.

The missteps were with the service.  While the atmosphere of the restaurant was trendy and upscale, our service was rather casual.  Our server was kind of condescending and kept asking us ""are you sure?"" whenever we would order something.  We tried to get garlic on our pizza and she told us there was enough on top of it already, which there wasn't.   She also asked if we wanted the salad with the pizza, to which we replied yes.  After the pizza came out we still had no salad and two different people had to come ask if we ordered a salad.  It was just kind of odd.

The homemade dumplings take a little longer and we were warned and given a time frame from one of the servers here before we ordered. The homemade beef noodle soup came with warm soup and tender beef pieces in a large bowl noodles. The noodles were standard in my opinion, but as a whole, it was a decent price for the value of their food. This bowl is their signature bowl in my opinion - everyone seems to order it!

The dumplings were actually my favourite part of this meal. There were 12 large dumplings that had delicious hot soup inside each and every single one of the them. The skin of the dumpling IS a little thicker, and usually I'm not a fan of thicker skinned dumplings, but this one definitely was an exception.

I have heard of Homer's quite a lot from a friend and how reliable they are.  So I took a chance, called them near closing of the day and they were able to squeeze me in first thing in the morning.  

I decided to wait for my car to be done and it took less than a hour to have it in, inspected and back out.  Didn't try to 'find' something wrong with it to pinch some more money out of me.  

I can't say thank you enough for being able to get me in last minute, how fast they were able to do it and how polite they are to you.",2012-05-01 21:05:04

That is until one day when you meet up with friends for lunch and you end up here.  Walking in to this place during lunch time is like walking into a wall of noise.  Now don't get me wrong, it's a good sign to walk into.  That means this place has been and will be busy, that it is well liked, and it's a local favorite.

Inside is set up a little wonky, but it works for the space.  The main room is rather large and open.  On the one side of this room is the bar area to which I cannot speak of as I did not go up there.  On the other side of this room there is the kitchen.  Unlike most establishments where the kitchen is hidden, you have full view of how the food is constructed.  With that, it's kind of amusing to watch because patrons end up almost walking into the kitchen by mistake.

We were seated in a raised booth right off the kitchen and that turned out to be great service for us.  Our server was top notch with her knowledge of the food and menu.  She was able to give suggestions to my friends as I already saw what I wanted to devour.  

I opted for the Pittsburger.  Now I want to straighten something out from the description on the menu.  They state that this eight ounce burger that comes off the wood fire grill and is topped with provolone cheese, fresh cut French fries and a homemade vinaigrette slaw placed on fresh Italian bread.  Everything about that is true except the bread.  What I got wasn't fresh Italian bread, what I got resembled more along the lines of New York Texas style toast.  I feel that because of this bread choice, that's what made the sandwich turn out a bit soggier than I expected.  Believe you me, it still tasted great, but a bit wet.  Of course you know I got fresh cut fries as my side.  I love fresh fries.  I don't care how you season them, but something better about a potato cut up and fried.  Tastes so much better then the prepackaged frozen stuff.",2016-12-04 20:33:22

It was fairly quiet at 7:30 with only a few other tables taken.  Unfortunately, the meal started out with a rather novice waiter going through a list of what is no longer available ""due to a busy weekend"".  Do you like seafood... forget about it since the calimari, scallops, mussels, etc were gone.  Everything is ala carte, so plan for about $40-45 per person if you have salad and appetizers.  They had a Prix Fixe menu option which, for $29, included starter or salad, subset of dinner menu items, and a dessert.  Dinner for us began with a couple of rather meager 'Starters' - shrimp bruchette and prawns on polenta (you get three with each $11-12 dish.   They were very good, but not more than a bite or two for each person.  Then the salads came - half plates at best of fresh mixed greens - good, but nothing particularly interesting or compelling about them.  And finally the main course - we had halibut, salmon and chicken - all were excellent, but again, don't come famished because the meals are moderately sized (the US government may say that no more than 8 ounces of animal protein should be consumed per meal, but if I'm hungry and am puting a good dent into my bank account for the meal, I'm expecting to walk away slightly more than satiated).  The desserts were also very good and adequately sized - we shared two bannana bread pudding and a choclolate decadence, and they hit the spot.  We also opted for a couple of mid-priced bottles of an Oregon Pinot.  The final bill which included tax and the automatic 18% tip for being a party of six or more (more than the waiter deserved based on his performance) was $356.  They did accept our $100 restaurant.com certificate without issue, which helped take a bite out of the bill.  The meal was really very good, but would have been outstanding had the waiter been a little more on his game, and portions a little more generous.",2009-10-19 16:13:56

The meal started out fine - I liked the mushroom puff pastry appetizer and the ""knife and fork"" caesar salad; both were quite simple but prepared well (although the salad was absolutely covered in balsamic - recommend getting it on the side unless you adore balsamic).

Unfortunately, the main was a disaster. I opted for the combination ""filet mignon"" and lamb (which was just a single bone off a rack). I asked for medium rare and both were so overcooked that they were difficult to eat - they were far beyond well done. I also don't think the meat was good quality, although of course this perception may have been simply due to the severe overcooking.

Service was lacking - seemed really understaffed. The food runner was so harried that he would drop our plates on the table (literally, with a loud *clunk* and no attention to how they were oriented or placed) before running off. Drink refills had to be requested almost every time (and sometimes multiple times), we waited forever to settle the check, etc. Also, a party member doesn't drink alcohol but was assured that any nonalcoholic drink that she got would be gratis in lieu of the wine parings, but they wound up charging us for every single beverage that she ordered. Not cool.

The other problem is that random staff (owner? managers? hostesses? not sure) would constantly interrupt us during our meal to make small talk and joke around. I get that they are trying for a neighborhood-y, family, touchy-feely vibe here but it was just so over the top - weird jokes and personal space violations, etc. It also came off as insincere because the service was so bad. Like at the end of our meal, someone came by and told us, ""we are really grateful for you coming in tonight"" (along with rubbing my shoulder...) and it's like, our check's been sitting on our table with our credit cards in it for more than 10 minutes... if you really appreciate us, maybe have someone run it?

I would love to give this place a second chance, but given the price and my first experience, maybe not in few years.
For appetizer, I had the escargot. It was okay but not very special. I've had better for cheaper price. I also had the caesar salad, and it was also just okay (but then, I don't have high expectations from the salad). Finally, for main entree, I ordered a T-bone steak and shared it with my husband. The steak, which was supposed to be the highlight of the night, was dissapointing. I asked for a medium well one, and it was burned and dry. I have been eating medium-well steak all my life, and it's not an impossible requests especially in good steak restaurants. I am not sure if they were busy that night or they grilled it for too long, but for a $30-40ish dollar steak, it was wayyy overrated.

If you have a chance to travel the Southern US you will see there are so many styles of BBQ. Kansas City style is where most Canadian BBQ derives many of it's flavours from. KC style is used with grilled meats usually ribs then basted with a sauce that is more tomato base. You head down to Texas and Texas Pit is King and Brisket rules house. Memphis is known for a ribs and the options are wet or dry rub (which I prefer) with sauce options on the side some infusing bourbon. in the Carolina's pulled pork is King and more of a tangy mustard-vinegar base sauce rules. These are the styles I really know and have experienced in my pre-yelp years. 

So.....my experience is biased as I've had the fortunate opportunity to eat some excellent belly busting BBQ. 

Diablos is okay but not the best I've eaten. Mediocre at best. I ordered the half rack of ribs with mash potato and house salad with corn relish. Reason it was mediocre. Meat was not fall off the bone. If you have to work at it to chew it it's not exceptional BBQ. Secondly the sauce tasted like it came out of a plastic bottle. No BBQ house should serve what tastes like I can get at my local grocery store. Thirdly an excellent BBQ  house should have exceptional sides. These sides were okay but nothing memorable or earth shattering. To wash it down I ordered a Mojito which was one of the worst ones I've had in a while. It came in a mason jar but did not taste very good but I still drank it. 

Service was also a bit slow. From the time we ordered it seemed like 30-40 minutes till we received our food out on the terrace. Ribs when done right should be served within five minutes from ordering. The true professionals smoke a huge amount all day and all you need is to warm it up. 

If you want to read about true BBQ check out Bucky's BBQ in Greenville, SC. Or else google Dreamland BBQ in Tuscaloosa, AL. 

The food here is okay and edible just it takes more to impress me with high quality BBQ. Pricing is a bit higher but that's par for the course in Montreal.  

I'd declare Triple Crown Dinette the best so far I've tried in MTL. Rubs is okay similar to diablos but more smoked flavour. My next place to check out is Blackstrap.",2015-06-24 03:00:10

The pizza was good, but not amazing. I like a lot of Daiya on my pizza, so when I go again I'll definitely ask for extra. Also, I ordered spinach on my pizza and I felt that the spinach wasn't fully cooked, just a little wilted.

North Harbor Club sits right next to I-77 on Lake Norman just outside of Charlotte, NC.

I beg you to go on a beautiful day and sit outside to consume the views of Lake Norman and the nice boating activity.
There's plenty of outdoor seating, plus some very nice lounge style outdoor space to sit comfortably for hours with friends enjoying drinks!

We started with a bottle of wine and a rarity for them, fried calamari!  The calamari isn't normally on the menu, but this day it was, and it was fantastic!  Lightly battered with a fantastic accompanying sauce made this a superb dish!
We then ordered the Lobster Mac as a appetizer, seeing how popular it was, and was quite pleased with this creamy and rich rendition of a seafood dish!

But when thinking of the world of department stores, Simon's trumps the Bay for affordable trendy clothing. Just don't expect to find a cosmetics department. 

My first Simon's experience was a few years ago. I obsessed over the leggings, the sale items, ""Twix,"" the guys t-shirt collection ($14.99 for graphic tees) and the housewares. Over the course of the past couple of years I have received more compliments on Simon bought sale rack items than the rest of my wardrobe. I've gone so far as to ask friends to bring me staples like black Simon brand tights when they visit Vancouver. The only thing that I knew I wanted to do, shopping wise at least, when I arrived in Montreal was hit my Mecca for department store shopping. And again, no disappointments.

Service is a hit or miss,  mostly miss.  It's a Vietnamese restaurant so I wasn't expecting much,  and I didn't want over-service,  either. But..  Just a bit more effort than throwing two menus down after having the customers seat themselves and just walking away. No,  it wasn't busy or anything. It's kind of surprising because there are mostly young servers so idk, maybe jaded already? 

The lack of stars is the food. If you are coming here I would stick to soup or broth dishes,  like pho. The rice plates are one of the most disappointing I've ever seen. I don't think it was like this in the beginning. The rice plates should fill you up because of rice, meats, and accompanying sides.  But it's just small,  period.  

The egg cake / steamed egg / egg loaf side is gray colored and smells off. The shredded pork smells unsettling too. The meat is small portioned.  The Bo Luc Lac, or filet mignon with rice,  is a premier, pricier dish in viet restaurants. I tasted it off a friend's plate and was not expecting how bland and chewy it was. It's a gray color that doesn't give you the impression it's quality beef that was prepared at the time of the order..  (if you're going through the pictures, it definitely did NOT look like the one from 2013) 

I'm being really specific because I actually don't encounter this at all with rice plates in any other place. 

I did eat the chicken fried with red rice a while ago a couple of times. I thought it was good even though the chicken was dry and the rice wasn't too red. It didn't come with any sides so maybe I was spared because of that reason. 

Pho is okay. The thinly sliced beef in it could be better but I think it's decent overall. The Bun Rieu, a crab shrimp broth bowl, is a little less than OK because the flavor could be stronger. 

So anyway,  stick to your soups.",2016-11-14 05:23:55

Oh yeah, for those with kids, this place is very kid friendly.  The kids menu is standard, but pretty good.  I actually ate my kid's pizza, which was huge!  There were 4-5 large slices, for only $6.

i normally get the black sesame tan tan ramen for the spiciness and the affordability of it. last time, i decided to try the red dragon ramen and i'm so in love! the spiciness is on point and the taste was phenomenal from the pletora of toppings. i savoured each and every bite. on top of this, they don't skimp out on the quantity of the food - my ramen was filled to the brim with toppings and I was stuffed by the end of the meal. I normally like to order a side of cha sun don (bork rice bowl) for a dollar cheaper if ordered with ramen. even though the flavour is simple, the taste is extraordinary

I'm not a big fan of ramen but I decided to try this out anyways since it's cheaper than other Michelin star restaurants.. plus the fact that it has a Michelin star. My friend and I waited in line for about 45 minutes or so. This is in the same unit as a Japanese dessert place so I guess that's convenient if you get hangry and want a quick little bite to hold you till you get to the ramen. 
They're known for their clam broth ramen (which I also highly recommend), but they also have tonkotsu and even a vegetarian option (which I thought was nice). I figured I wouldnt be able to find the clam broth ramen elsewhere so decided to order the shio version (milder). 
This place has changed my opinion on ramen. I honestly thought I didn't like ramen because I've visited the other very popular ramen places in Toronto, but I've never really been impressed by it. However, this was a game changer. The broth was full bodied and the noodles had the right amount of chewiness. I added an egg to mine (extra $1.50) and that was perfectly done. Usually my friend and I talk a bit during any of our food missions, but when we sat down for that bowl of ramen, we were both silent since we were enjoying it so much. The total came to about $20, which is pricey for ramen, but then again, cheap for a Michelin star item. 

I live in GTA so I don't go to North York much. I might have to make an exception and venture up more often for this ramen though...",2018-03-05 03:54:30

Finally, we went for a modern look since we customize our home in a modern type of way. 

Only reason why I deducted a star is because the sheer curtain we liked wasn't available in white color. It came more in an ivory or creamy color. Ask this nice lady who did ask if we needed help says that they have different manufacturers who sends different color....hmmmm...oh well, no biggy. There is always Wal-Mart! 

Tip: when grabbing curtains make sure you grab the right length. I believe they have 3 different lengths. There was a few that i grab that wasn't the right ones. So I'll be exchanging it soon.

Their options aren't plenty nor is their decor anything fancy because people just come in and out of this restaurant to eat. A simple stop like a gas station when you're on a long road trip, except you get to chow down on their delicious noodles for a cheap price!

Their menu consists of soupy noodles or dry noodles with a bit of sauce at the bottom and a side bowl of soup, it is stated as ""Lo Mein"" above.

The noodles comes with wonton (shrimp dumpling), beef brisket, or dumplings. Their dumplings are the water dumplings, also known as ""水餃"" or ""Suey/Sui Gao"" in Cantonese and ""Shui Jiao"" in Mandarin.

I got simple Wonton noodles in soup! They have condiments on the side, so naturally, I'm going to add spice, heehee. Really standardized Wonton noodles, or ""Wonton Mein"". Usually comes in the form of the yellow noodles and big juicy pieces of Wonton.

This is the Beef Brisket in vermicelli noodles, as they ran out of the rice noodle. The rice noodles that they use here are the thicker, fatter ones. 

I'm not sure why it's a thing, but whenever I eat Wonton noodles, it's like a thing to get side vegetables, with hoisin/hoi xin sauce at the side. I believe these vegetables are ""kai-lan"" also known as Chinese Kale. The vegetables help provide a crunchy bit towards the meal - I like adding vegetables towards my meals as well so it's a good combination!

Wonton Chai is a simple place to eat this very simple classic Chinese dish of Wonton, Suey Gao and Beef noodles. Service is quick and tables are pretty big. They don't have small 2 seaters, but instead have big round tables to fit about 6 people each.

There is also tea at the corner for you to self-service, with paper cups. In some simple noodle places like this, they have this style of service. Unless you come with more people, then they'll provide a teapot.

Wonton Chai is definitely a hidden cheap eat gem which most people don't know about because it's not exactly in a popular location, etc... But the meals here are easy going and simple. So don't expect much and enjoy the simplicity of a classic Chinese meal!",2016-02-27 04:58:21

My brother is visiting me, from the UK, so I decided to bring him here for dim sum. Food was taking at least 30 minutes to arrive, some dishes took 45 minutes. When food did come, it was just ok. Most dishes were nothing to rave about and most were bland.  Service for replenishing tea/hot water was really slow. We had problems flagging a server down and twice the hostess helped us because we were seated near her, at the door. I am giving a bad review today because of what happened when we paid the bill. 
It took us 10 minutes to get someone to calculate our bill. Then another 10 minutes to get our bill. The total was $43.60 and my brother paid with a $50 bill. I joked and said that he wouldn't get any change. Well we waited for 10 minutes and he didn't get any change. So he got mad and went up to the cashier. He asked about his change, the black suit had poured it into the tip box without bringing it back to our table. We saw him do it because the place is not particularly busy. The cashier just opened the tip box and gave it back to my brother. My brother brought it back to our table and we still left a $4.40 tip. Which is still 10%, after tax. I was so embarrassed to have taken my brother there today. I thought that I would take him to a nicer decorated place, instead of our usual dives, but to just assume all the change is a tip is ridiculous.  All restaurants should take the change back, unless told - no change. 
I' m never going back here again. Rubbish food, slow service and too many black suits chatting and doing nothing at the cashier stand.  Place is not that busy anymore, and I can see many reasons why.",2015-06-25 01:54:39

This is a great alternative to the bar scene and a perfect place for intimate after dinner cocktails or to meet friends for a rowdy evening at the bar.

Update:  Finally stayed at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch.  Although the rooms are average, the resort is so wonderful, it is still five stars in my book.  They do need to update the rooms a bit as we saw a visible water leak.  However, the beds were incredibly comfy and the big deck for sunbathing was nice.

They have a nice market where you can get a huge variety of things, from fresh vegetables to freshly made pies! There is also a perfect barn where you can see many animals.  This is ideal for small kids to get to see animals in the nature and even feed them (feeding the goats is so much fun).  There is also a nice little cafe/restaurant with nice sandwiches, which I suspect utilizes the fresh produce of the farm.  Pull pork, meatball, chicken salad sandwiches and more delicious things.

However, the best part of the whole experience is the fruit picking.  Depending on the season there are different fruits that you can go and pick yourself; from the farm to your table! We have been to the apple picking in the fall and the strawberry picking in the summer and it is great! During the fall there is a huge selection of pumpkins for halloween as well which makes it extra fun, with a small horror house (it is not really scary as it is mainly made for small kids).  All in all a great place to have some connection with nature and get your fresh produce!",2014-06-16 15:46:32

The place was empty, save for the guy drinking whiskey at the bar and chatting with the bartender.  The TVs were HUGE and there were skeletons hanging from the ceiling.  This Boneyard has an identity crisis.  Is it an arcade?  A theater?  A restaurant or a sports bar?  You tell me.

Once we were seated, the burly bartender brought us some menus, silverware, and took our drink order.  I ordered the Steak Fajta and Cajun Fries and my co-worker ordered a burger with cheese, lettuce, and tomato.  They didn't have blue-cheese, as he originally requested though.

Within 10 minutes, our food arrived hot and fresh.  My first bite into my Steak Fajita wasn't pleasing, so I took another bite.  It too was not pleasing.  Oh well, I thought,  and I finished the thing.  My fries were really tasty.  They were cooked perfectly and the Cajun seasoning was really tasty.  Loved it.  And the fries were decently plump, as I like them.

My co-worker agreed that the fries were very good.  He also liked his burger....a LOT.  So much so that he asked me to mention it in my Yelp! review.  Hi Mark!  Lucky dog is on his way to Mexico tomorrow!  

Anyway, the service kind of sucked, seeing as it was a lone bartender.  One group of four women joined the 'crowd', bringing the grand total of patrons to 7.  I think one person can keep 7 drinks topped off, how about you?  Unfortunately, that was not the case and so my co-worker also asked me to tell you that the service is poor.  I would agree, but it was lunch and this place is hard to spot.  So not many people go here or even know to go here for lunch.

On our way out we noticed a huge arcade in the front.  We toured the arcade and it was very nice, all lit up with tons of games, including pool and bowling!  However, something was amiss: no one was there!  It was a little spooky seeing this huge arcade with nobody in it.  All the creepy noises and lights...

Sandra Bullock is a horrible actress

High School was NOT the best time of my life

Postino Winecafe does not live up to the hype

...while I write this, I of course realize that most people sadly somehow enjoy Sandra Bullock films, think High School was a blast, and...at least according to the reviews on Yelp, adore Postino Winecafe. 

The food is decent enough...bruschetta was flavorful (although on our last visit the bread was a little hard) and the Pub Board appetizer is amazing. The main gripe we have with this place is the service. Do you have to spend a lot of money on alcohol or look like a hipster here to get good service or what? We went for a light meal...nothing more. I don't see a sign on the door that says 'must buy wine', so why did our waiter treat us like a couple of vagrants while he was overly friendly to tables around us who were spending more money? I get it...higher bill, higher tip...this is no excuse for bad service though. A paying customer is a paying customer. The disparity in service couldn't have been more painfully obvious, and that's a shame. Maybe we went on an off night...or maybe Postino is getting cocky...who knows?

We had a decent meal, but left feeling like outsiders instead of valued guests. Maybe next time if I wear a 'deep V-neck' and Katrina wears some 'jeggings', we'll appear wealthier and get better service. Eh.

For me pho comes down to 4 things. 
1. the soup. 
2. the noodles
3. the meat
4. cleanliness

The soup here is real, some places try to cut corners by not using real stock, they go with the ""gaijing"" or chicken/pork base, this saves hours of prep and time (and is cheaper) but the taste isn't there. If you want to know if real stock is being used, take a cup full home, put it in the fridge and if it has fat settled on the top in form of white dots, its the real deal. THIS PLACE USES REAL STOCK AND THE FLAVOR IS REALLY REALLY GOOD.

The noodles here are good, they don't give you a ton, so if you are a big eater like myself you can order extra, or load up on the sprouts and basil. I am 6'4 and push 300 lbs, this place fills me up with out extra noodles, mainly due to the generous portion of meat.

The meat here is perfect. IT IS CUT THIN!!! There are so many pho places that simply slice their meat too thick and it tastes chalky and hard to digest. Here they do it perfect. The rare eye of the round, brisket and fatty brisket are perfect. I get the #18 that comes with all the above with tendon and tripe.

You can tell this place is well taken care of. The hoisin sauce bottle is clean, the hot sauce container doesnt have 3 week old hot sauce jerky hanging from it (foodies will know what i mean) and the place is decorated nicely, service is fast and nice.

Catfish po boy solid but nothing earthshaking.

Environment is generally laid back and pleasant.  

Service is very pleasant and competent, but food was pretty slowly paced - maybe just the nature of the place.  1.5hrs for Brunch seems a bit deliberate, but I suppose it's refreshing that they're not in a hurry to turn tables (just that much of the time was waiting the long gap between beignets and entrees).

Curiously sullen hostess (not a teen) seemed to think it was ok to walk by staring at guests w her grumpy disposition.   Tried a polite smile to break the awkward interface but only seemed to make her darker.",2018-03-18 20:46:39

Multiple floors with an awesome outdoor area with a pool smack dab in the middlle. The dance floors get packed, especially the one playing hip hop music. The night me and my 6 galpals went, DJ Kascade happened to be there doing his thing. The best part of the night were the STRONG DRINKS our bartender kept giving us.

As for getting in to the club, we had a promoter who told us to be in a certain line at a certain time so we wouldn't have to pay a cover. We got there by the expected time only to be corralled in a large line with other groups of people whose own promoters also told them the same thing. After a 20 minute wait we eventually got in, although there were lines a plenty with people crammed in every single line.  

I'd come back just for the rather large outdoor area, but the lines to get into the club are pretty ridiculous even if you know a promoter.",2011-08-28 20:42:38

The service was one of the best things about our experience there.  Our waiter was patient, prompt, and took the time to answer all of our questions, to explain dishes to us, and to warn us of non-vegan friendly ingredients in some things.  He also made GREAT recommendations, right down to dessert.

I began my meal with a vegetarian fish ball soup (carrot, cauliflower, veggie broth, and sliced fish ball).  It was perfectly seasoned and light.  I ordered the ""combination"" bento box with Kung Po ""Chicken"".  It came with a salad, spring roll, ""chicken nuggets"", purple rice, & plum dipping sauce.  The salad was nicely done, with a halved strawberry & red grape, sliced orange, kiwi & apple, served on mixed greens.  The spring roll was pretty standard, but the chicken nuggets were incredible!  The seasoning was more than perfect, and they tasted so fresh, they just melt in your mouth.  On my next visit, I plan to get a big order of the nuggets as my meal.  The purple rice was also very well done, and beautifully laid out and garnished.  So few restaurants take the time to garnish their rice, but it's always a great touch.  And the main part, the Kung Po chicken was just fabulous.  I bit spicy, but really, really good.  

I also tasted the enoki mushroom balls, which I highly recommend.  For dessert, we shared the Skor bar, and the Magic bar; two dessert squares.  The Skor bar was less caramel, more chocolate chip shortbread, but still delicious.  The Magic bar included 3 kinds of chocolate, and coconut.  I preferred the Magic bar, but it was a lot harder to bite into because of a hard chocolate foundation.

My only criticism, is that there is a draft every time the door is opened if you sit by the front window because there is a gap between the glass wall by the entry and the dining area.  They also play very soothing Japanese flute music, but often I felt like passing out at the table because of it.  Reminded me of the music I meditate to, or the sort they play at the spa.  Otherwise, great decor, & it was very clean & wonderful for groups.",2010-03-21 08:48:53

They had obviously been sitting out for a long time, and were now completely spoiled. My question is, why didnt the cashier go put them back right when the customer dropped them, or call someone else to do it? Why let a perfectly good (and expensive) piece of meat go to waste when there are hundreds of families out there just scraping by enough to get a small dinner on the table each night.

The choice of pitchers was ridiculously limited (dark or light, only).

That being said, it's worth checking out because the decor of the place is just awesome. Very 'mod' and they have (obvious from the name, perhaps) pool tables, and a dance floor although it is a tiny dance floor considering the actual place is pretty huge. 

The crowd definitely is not a particularly interesting one, but the cover before midnight is cheap, so it's worth going to if you don't want to dress up and pay a freakin' fortune just to get in.

We walked in on a Saturday night without a reservation for a late, pre-movie dinner. This place was packed, like really packed. This place isn't huge, but they literally utilize every bit of space they have with a tables and chairs. There is zero room to stand at the bar while waiting for a table, which is a major bummer. Honestly, there really isn't anywhere to stand while waiting. This really is the only negative I see in this place. I'd get rid of the two impossibly small tables directly in front of the bar so that people can get a drink. As of now, you can sit at the bar but there is no room for anyone behind that first seated row. 

Now onto the food and drinks. I started with the Plush cocktail, make with muddled grapes, vodka and Cava. It was a little too sweet for my taste, but I can see how the ladies would love this cocktail. There were plenty of other signature drinks to choose from, but afterwards I moved onto a very dirty vodka martini with blue cheese olives. This was made perfectly, no complaints. 

We were finally seating at a smallish table, right in front of the semi-open kitchen. It was pretty cool to be able to watch the magic happen, but the atmosphere still seemed a little cramped. We started with the cheese plate for two. I was a little sad they had no option to get a mix of cheese and meat, but whatever, the cheeses were good. I would have liked to see more cows milk cheeses, not just goat. The hardest cheese on the plate was the best and the real showstopper was the bacon jelly--oh yes. 

For our entrees I ordered the scallops and my boyfriend ordered the rainbow trout. Everything was fresh and delicious. My scallops were perfectly seared and simply prepared. It would have been nice to have just one more punch of flavor, but the dish was still delicious... again, just simply-made. The same goes for the rainbow trout. It came out simply grilled, minimally seasoned over a bed of greens. The dish was extremely fresh, but it was missing an extra layer of flavor. Either way, we left full and happy.

I choose this place because we both LOVE lobster bisque and after reading the reviews decided to try Kokomo. Lobtser bisque ($18) was AMAZING!  It was so creamy and fulfiling that we could have just stopped there.  
Other yelpers have commented that the portions were not big enough for the cost and suprised that you had to pay extra for your sides..... Im wondering if they have really every been to a fine dinning resturant before.  ONLY cuz if you have ever been to fine dinning here or anywhere else (my personal experience being LV, DC and NY) sides are extra.  
Anyway I thought the postions were about what one would pay.  I ordered the Colorado Lamb Chops ($36).  THREE huge lamb chops cooked perfectly to the med rare that I requested. (I didn't even finish the first one)  
My friend ordered the  Washuguyu Tenderloin Carpaccio ($26). She was still full from the lobter bisque but was determined to finish it cuz it was soo good. 
We split two sides but would have been fine spliting just one cuz the portion are for at least two people.  We got a side of the mac and cheese ( Friend LOVES mac and cheese)  and it was just ok.  I felt I could have done just as good if I would have made it at home myself.  The 2nd side was the Loaded sea salt baked potato.  Yes it was just a baked potatoes but neither one of us could stop eatting it.  Much better than the mac and cheese.  
Overall I would return, especially for the lobster bisque!",2012-04-09 18:31:27

With tons of eats in Miracle Mile and even inside Planet Hollywood, I'm amazed on how often my food choice out here comes down to D' Amore's Famous Pizza.  Let's get somethings straight, I don't eat pizza often.  And when I do, I am often disappointed. D' Amore's has been there for me, especially past midnight when almost everything in here is closed.  

Staff is amazing.  Not one Associate ever forgets to greet you.  You can tell that at this establishment customer service is their priority.  

Now for their pizza.  Some people have their preferences like Chicago deep dish or NY style thin crust.  I am a deep dish fan myself, but find D'Amore's thin crust a great change of pace. Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Domino's, and the rest of the commercialized joints don't even compare.  The pizza is greasy like it should be, but you can still taste all the ingredients. Never too saucy, which is my preference. After a few bites, you'll forget that you're even in a mall.  You'll feel like you're in that Mama Pop hole in the wall type pizzeria.  That's how it should be.

Whether it's a long day shopping the mall, partying with friends at the bar or losing a grip at Planet Hollywood, I at least know that I have one consistent...a stop at D' Amore's before I head home.",2012-11-11 00:59:09

We haven't been back since.  So when my husband decided to give it another try, I was a little hesitant.  

We got a couple of appetizers, a flatbread pizza, which had fresh mozzarella cheese and sweet tomato sauce. Garnished with fresh basil and Parmesan cheese.  We also got the crispy fried artichokes.  It was lightly breaded artichoke hearts fried crisp and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.  Both of these were very good.

For an entree, I got a good old bacon burger, smoked applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and pickles, smothered with their special sauce.  It was juicy and very good.  I love bacon, so if I would change anything, I would add more bacon!

Service this time was very good, I enjoyed the food, my husband was disappointed with his choice of entree, the old fashion pot roast.  He said it was truly ""old"" as in taste, he felt it was the left overs from the night before.

The food I've ordered from the bar is mediocre at best, but you can bring anything in from the store and pay for it as part of your bill. That's pretty kick ass IMO. Be sure to let them know that is what you are doing when you walk in so they can weigh your stuffs.

They're a popular chain from Taiwan offering large fried chicken. They got their start at the Shi-Lin Night Market in Taipei, and has since expanded internationally with several overseas locations. 

The item is essentially an oversized crispy chicken coated in batter and made to order. I liked that I was able to customize the spice level, but it was only on one side. I am not sure if you are able to ask for it to be coated on both sides, but that'd be nice. Since they use chicken breast (boned-in), the chicken was pretty juicy and moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. Although the original was tasty, their new  Hot Cheese Fried Chicken was a lot better in my opinion. Things just taste better with cheese! Get the cheese one unless you're lactose intolerant, of course. 

The blue curacao yogurt drink complemented well with the fried chicken. I only got it cause it looked pretty, but it ended up tasting pretty good. 

The popcorn chicken was really good and quickly devoured by our table. I'd get it again as a snack. Wings were only decent though. While the fried king oyster mushroom was good, the portion was super small for the price. Not really worth the price, so I'd skip it. I am actually going to Taiwan for one week next year (April 2018), so I'll be sure to check out Hot-Star at one of the night markets there just to compare.",2017-09-22 19:28:55

The music at the waiting area is like clubbing music and not a good idea when you have 14 hungry pissed off customers at the waiting area at 9:20PM

The staff will remind you that there is no guarantee. I learned very early in my life that there is no guarantee in life. So that was okay. We were told by 9:30pm that everyone can get a seat. 9:24pm finally sat down. The music is way too loud for the dining room.

I find the meat nice, but some marinade a little too sweet. The Wagyu AYCE items are Australian sirloin steak, melts in your mouth. I think the sesame is not really necessary. But after awhile, it's not easy to tell whether is Australian or US. We ordered a drink each, the bill came to $198 with 12% service charge included. The sake clams (limited offer) were nice. Nice enough I was scooping up the cooked sake from my shell. The cooked food such as the takoyaki and chicken karaage tasted good. Overall, it was good experience. A little pricy, but worth a try!

HEADLINES
+ Convenience factor is high  
+ Wide diversity in beverages (beer, wine. cocktail list)
+ Food & Drink menu very affordable
+ Ample seating
+ Nice employees
+ Fresh food (Hey, this is Whole Foods!)
+ No reservations
+ TV's available
+ BRING CASH TO TIP!

DETAILS 
It's swell that the staff can ring you up, if you have a small/medium order. You can also place your food order as you arrive to shop. (No need to wait long at the bar for food.)

The beer tap list is impressive. Every time I go on and on about The Bar in Whole Foods, people ask if I work there. No, the  Bar in Whole Foods just happens to have a lot of beer! LOCAL! Wine too. LOCAL!

Service is a work in progress. Amazing efforts made, but, definitely a work in progress. It may help to sit closer to the bar to remain in staff eyesight.

Thank you for making grocery shopping a bubbly experience ;)",2014-01-06 03:40:23

If you check-in, you get free Edamame and Miso Soup, which isn't too shabby. The edamame is very warm when it comes out, but they may add a wee bit too much extra salt on them for seasoning. Miso soup is standard. 

The beauty of this place is in their unique and elaborately designed rolls. My favorite is easily the Oasis roll, which has a refreshing vinegar-cucumber wrap (opposed to the typical seaweed wrap) around more refreshing crab and salady-goodness. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water and want to go back again soon. 

Their traditional rolls are even special because of its use of purple rice. The rice is soft and delicious and just fascinating to eat. H3 rolls, Las Vegas Roll, Dynamite Rolls... some mango roll... all so flavorful. 

The salmon nigiri..is just. so. good, too... I don't know how they make it seem like it's fresh because Phoenix definitely isn't close to any waters.... But the presentation is so clean and the amount of ginger used to speckle the top is perfection.

The waitress is also awesome. She is so hyped up with energy somehow and pleasantly nice. Very good demeanor even when it's busy and she is scurrying around everywhere. 

The only odd part is the bathrooms are out the back door... and through more back doors. 

I saved this place to be my 100th Yelp review. :)",2014-12-22 05:06:30

Noise level is very high, sometimes difficult to hear yourself.  Service is always pleasant, friendly and efficient.  Menu is extensive with some wonderful options for everyone. Prices are reasonable and portions are large.  My only complaint would be on the lamb chops.  Although they are delicious and flavorful, they are not very adept at cooking medium rare.  My chops were medium at best, with some well done.  Overall a pleasant experience and always a safe bet.  I will be back.  OPA!",2011-02-18 04:50:40

College bars just aren't my scene, living in Boston will do that to you.  But given it was the summer and we were in a group of 50 I thought it would be ok. 

We took over the whole back part which was nice.  The drinks were well made and I'm assuming cheap.  They have two pool tables in the back, which are slightly awkward given their close proximity to the bar.  The music was fairly generic ranging from your classic drunk girl anthems (Pour Some Sugar on Me) to current Top 40 hits.  My husband enjoyed the bathroom attendant, whom he swears must have be related to Lil Jon, saying things like ""Get yo piss on!""  

They have a ""no pictures"" policy which I found to be incredibly lame.  You can't snap a picture of you and your friend having a good time without their written permission?  Really?  Guys, its not that impressive of a place that you have to try to keep it secretive.  I've actually never experienced something like that before and most of the places I frequent are a lot nicer than this.

Deni was our service and he did an excellent job of showing us the ropes.  We didn't have reservations so we sat at a table.  Not a problem.  At the center of the table is a warmer and you order two different broths.  We ordered an original for the kids and a medium spicy for us.  

We ordered the angus, brisket, shrimp, veggies, noodles, dumplings, and more.  Everything was delicious.

Don't return it if it's sick. That's like wishing to abort a child when you know he/she has a defect. 

I understand puppies here are over $1k-almost $3500. But, they do finance. I bought my first puppy here. She, Tacoma, is a pure bred Siberian husky. Was 3 months, healthy, and very playful when we played with her. I fell in love. Had to buy her. She is now 2 yrs+ old-- great dog to go running, walking, hiking, etc with. I took Tacoma to puppy school and she was always the first to learn a new trick and obeys very well. Like I said, it's now where they are from, it's where they are going. Luckily, Tacoma is healthy, but the thing is, I take her to get her shots and get checked annually, & of she were sick, I would do anything and everything for my pup bcos she's my baby.

My party enjoyed our evening from the moment we stepped in: the restaurant features an open-concept floor plan, allowing one to see and be seen, with plenty of dark wood and chic light fixtures that add contemporary decorative flair.  Our server was very friendly and obviously wanted us all to have a positive experience, stopping by several times to refill water glasses and to check that everything was to our liking.

Honey Salt states that they are ""committed to providing fresh and innovative food"" (website) and they do indeed follow through.  Our collective entrées included the Scottish salmon (served on a bed of quinoa pilaf, braised fennel, house-made peppadew chimichurri sauce; $25), the free range brick oven chicken (served with kale and anaheim pepper mac n' cheese; $22), and the caramelized sea scallops (served with charred cauliflower and vanilla bean cauliflower puree; $28).  All were delightful, fresh, and delicious.  I especially enjoyed my chimichurri sauce with my salmon, as the bright flavours complemented the delicacy of the fish.  My hubby's scallops were fantastic!  The chicken was not overcooked at all (whew!) and the mac 'n cheese was so yummy.  For dessert, we shared a warm bread pudding (with the most lovely bourbon toffee sauce) and a (huge) slice of the triple layer cake (2 layers of chocolate fudge cake, 1 layer of roasted banana cake all iced with brown sugar buttercream).  Good thing we shared....sort of.  So good!  

I don't have any complaints about the food as everything was excellent.  The ambience is trendy and slightly slanted towards youth, but anyone can come here and enjoy a terrific meal.  My only critique about the actual space is that it would have been nice to have a bit more, er, space between tables.  Because of this, at times I felt like I was in a cafeteria.  A very chic, expensive cafeteria, but still...!  Honey Salt is not an inexpensive place, but then again, you get what you pay for....and you get quality here.  

I am DEFINITELY coming back to check out the lunch menu....and to snag another piece of that triple layer cake!  Make sure to take a look at the salt and pepper shakers display at the front of the restaurant -- so cute!",2012-12-14 04:59:47

From the parking lot, hike into the wash, cross the wash, and then walk up the stone steps.  Follow the trail along Ice Box Canyon until you reach a down section into the wash below.  This part of the hike is just about a mile in length.

After dropping down into the wash,  turn right and follow the wash as it winds through the canyon.  This will entail some rock and boulder scrambling.  If any of the boulders are too big to climb up, the trail will have a walk around to the left or right of the wash.  Sometimes you have to back track and go the other way, but this is the fun of hiking in a bouldering area.

From the entry into the wash, it's about 1/4 mile of rock scrambling to the end of the trail.  You'll know you're almost there when you see a tall, dead ponderosa pine leaning to the left.  The waterfall - usually dry as it was today - is just past this dead ponderosa.

When you get to the base of the waterfall, this is a good place to have a snack and chat for awhile before hiking back to your car.

Directions to trailhead:  Go west on Charleston Boulevard until you get to the Red Rock Canyon entrance.  From the fee booth (entrance fee $7), take the Scenic Drive just past mile marker 8.  The Ice Box Canyon Trailhead is on your right and is well marked.

I have posted some photos with this review.

There were two guests checking out when I arrived (on time), so I waited. Although technically I got there before the 2nd one came out. 
The receptionist was very friendly and I didn't mind waiting. However, when I went back with the massage therapist she informed me that since I was late, they would have to cut the massage short. I explained that I was on time. I think she may have cut off ten or so minutes but it wasn't really noticeable. 

Massage was very good. Great pressure.
Facial was also great. She applied a masque that was a little tingly but not over bearing. 
In between the treatments there is a little waiting area and she brought me a ginger tea.

Not exactly. 

I don't think its the food that draws people into The Standard - I've had way better Italian elsewhere. It's likely the low price - you get a lot of food for less than you'd pay in other places, but you sacrifice on the quality.  I was very disappointed with the polenta calamari - while the appetizer portion was very generous and more than enough for 3 of us to share, it was bland, dry and chewy. No amount of lemon or tomato sauce on the side could hide that fact. 

We also had the raddicchio-pear-walnut-goat cheese salad, which I'll admit was fresh and flavourful. The pizzas (""The Standard"" and that night's special of  mozzarella and mushrooms on whole wheat crust) were a touch oily, but they got a passing grade from me.

I've heard great things about Eez but am never really up in that area but was for an event and was excited I was finally able to go. They literally had two pages full of sushi selections (I am talking Cheesecake Factory length menus).I got Mark's Roll-Fresh tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, kani and scallion roll, coated with panko and flash fried. Topped with Japanese cream sauce and sriracha. Served with ponzu dipping sauce along with the TNT Roll-Spicy tuna, kani, avocado and fish roe 

Both were absolutely terrific and I really liked the atmosphere, it was dimly lit with Japanese inspired art and lighting fixtures and had great upbeat music playing. Plus they have have late night half priced sushi at 11P so I will need to hit this place up again if I am in the area.

To begin with, the dining room leaves a lot to be desired. You've got your standard tables and chairs that leaves a certain air of sadness. Along with that, you've got hateful posters looking down at people who eat meat. Not really a way to win over a non-vegan crowd. 

The food was subpar at best. I ordered their Hawaiian burger and let me tell you, it tasted mostly like sauce and pineapples. I couldn't taste anything else. Not even the tasteless patty. 

Their strawberry milkshake wasn't terrible, but it's not something I would order again, but their curly fries were good. I doubt they make them in-house. If they do, at least they got at least one thing going for them.

I actually got the lighter, clear chicken broth rather than the usual tonkotsu, because I wanted something lighter and the waitress recommended it. I wasn't a fan -- way too plain! Everyone else in my group got tonkotsu pork broth though, and the general consensus was that it was just okay. Common criticisms seemed to be that it's not as rich or flavourful as it should be.

We weren't the only ones that missed them. 

After being seated, our waiter asked for our drink order and was very friendly. 
We ordered our food along with chips & salsa, which still amazes me that they charge for them. Maybe a 2nd or 3rd basket.. but come on.. even Baja Fresh gives you chips why you wait... 

My husband ordered the Nacho Daddy burger which he said is probably one of best burgers he ever had.. 

I ordered a combination of the Shrimp & Fish tacos.. Highly recommend you try the fish tacos when you visit. They were pretty much everything you wish for in a taco.

Luckily, we were getting ready to leave everyone their seemed very friendly and lie waitress was so enjoyable and very friendly.

Room For Improvement: I like strong coffee. Coffee that puts a pep in your step and your ass in the john!

Good for coffee newbies who like their mochas to taste like chocolate milk. With the loud music, the ""cute"" staff, and the overly sweet drinks...it just seemed like this place was trying too hard.

I sat at the bar as the conversations are a little bit better and you can get a glimpse on what really goes on.  Overall the place was ok.

I got the 4 Enchilada plate (2 chicken, 2 pork) with verde sauce.   The chicken was a little chewy but the pork was pretty good.

However, I really just don't love the food. It's overpriced and looks and tastes so average. It almost seems like they're lazy. I did really like the tuna tartare!

Maybe it was because of my submaker - I walked up and said I had never been there and he proceeded to start reading the menu to me.  I cut him off and asked him what the most popular sandwich was and he told me that everything was really popular.  Rather than educate him on the fact that - by definition - everything could not be the most popular I just went with a Dagwood - which was featured in a poster.  

I paid almost $10 for my sandwich and drink and went to sit down.  A couple minutes later a sub got dropped off.

I can't say the sub was bad, but I did not feel like I had made the best choice and the meat/cheese/topping ratio did not correspond with the price paid and the size of the bread.

Location is awesome as it's a stones throw away from UofT, the ROM, Yorkville shopping, and the Bata Shoe Museum. 

Service is hit and miss as sometimes they are very friendly and attentive as other times they curse you behind your back and neglect you on purpose. I'm not sure why the service is so inconsistent but it always crosses my mind before I enter the doors. Am I going to get a friendly and attentive server or a hungover, miserable, inattentive one. I guess for some people it could be fun to see which side of Jekyll/Hyde is gonna show up but for me I dread it and get slightly anxious.

Food here is typical diner grub, also hit and miss. Sandwiches are huge, so are the breakfast platters, and so are the desserts.. hmm, looks like they have large servings here. Too bad it's either going to be a large serving of great food or crap food. Seasonings and cooking seem to be inconsistent. Sometimes too well done and over seasoned, other times almost raw and under seasoned.

Decor feels very comfortable. Light colored wood, blue walls, white and blue accents. Something about it makes me feel like I'm at Grandma's house, if she lived on T.V. and her house had to feed 50 people. Not sure why though, maybe it's the color layout and the small knickknacks on display. Maybe it's just my grandma that had white and blue all over the room with little knickknacks.

Overall, it's a tough one. When they are good they are great but when they are bad they're really really really bad. Pretty much a coin flip on this one but the odds aren't terrible. If you had a 50/50 chance of winning the lottery, the odds would seem amazing. At least the prices won't break the bank.",2009-06-09 07:57:33

We were immediately seated and were served by a fantastic female who took awesome care of us all night.  We ordered the chicken nachos as an appetizer and holy moley, they were enormous!  She and I could have happily shared this as our entree and called it good but we ordered BBQ as well.  We ate only half of the nachos before the biggest plates of food I've seen in a long time arrived at our table.  I had the pulled pork platter with cole slaw and mac and cheese and she had the rib tips with the same two sides.  It was absolutely delicious!  The only item I wasn't totally thrilled about was the mac n cheese, but that's only because I prefer Southern style mac (firm and can be cut into cake-like pieces).  Theirs is creamy.  It was good, but not my fave.  The cole slaw was awesome and the BBQ sauce that came with the pulled pork was sweet and smoky.  We were checked on by management twice while we ate and they were very kind and genuine.  
***TIP: If you check in, you get a free appetizer!  Our ridiculously huge and delicious nachos turned out to be free and we had no problem with redeeming the Yelp* coupon.  
Service here is top notch.  The portions are ridiculous, and for the price you pay, I felt it was extremely reasonable.  Before we left, one of the managers gave us a couple of ""two for one"" drink coupons and invited us back later on in the evening.  He told us the restaurant became a bar/dance club in the evening and boy was he right.  This was the most packed bar in all of Westgate and we had an absolute blast!  We danced all night, met tons of really nice people, and definitely used those 2 for 1 coupons the manager gave us earlier.

We shared deep-friend asparagus, which was GREAT. Came with an incredible sauce, although there were FIVE asparagus poppers, I think it should be four or six, five is not shareable and half of the tables in the restaurant are seats for couples. 
The reason my rating is only getting a 3 yet starting out so wonderfully, is the pricing. It is quite an expensive little bar-diner. Drinks are no less than $9, and some of the drinks have 2/3 fruit or garnish in the glass so you're honestly getting about 3 gulps and then you're done. Better off getting beer here, the cocktails aren't that great anyway. 
I had the Vegetarian Portobello Mushroom burger and my friend had the Lamb Burger, opposite sides of the spectrum. 
SO, there was about a semi-squirt of sauce on my friend's burger, which was really a selling point in her even ordering it, so she was mega disappointed. Seriously, there was NO SAUCE. It was a lamb burger with tziziki sauce and other stuff but all I could see was her struggling with a GIGANTIC piece of meat between a bun. The size of meat was honestly the size of my fist, and I have HUGE hands. Her only remarks were ""more sauce, less meat."" For the record, that honking piece of lamb was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious, just WAY too much for the little bun. 
My burger was fantastic, it was a ginormous portobello mushroom stuffed with alfalfa and goat cheese and red peppers, and it was delicious. I have no comments, except, don't eat it on a date, it's messy as all hell. 
So, if you're rollin' in cash, go splurge, it's delicious and quaint. If you're a student wanting cheap but good food and drinks, go elsewhere.

The kitchen is inconsistent with their preparation and ingredients. I've ordered the chicken Cobb salad three different times and each time it is different!

Sometimes you get slices of tomatoes, other times you get cherry tomatoes or diced tomatoes. Just weird. At least the ingredients are high quality. The side salad even has freshly shredded carrots. Nice!

Remember, this is a tourist-based restaurant in a casino. That means prices are high! Expect the $10 range for a burger and the $13 range for a salad. They have a captive audience and they know it. They send out coupons to locals so that's why I eat here once in a while.

We went here last night for the Biggies Bullies fundraiser, and it was our first time at Carson City. It was crowded downstairs, and kind of overwhelming between the people everywhere and the noise. We went up to the rooftop and it was so much more quiet, and there were TVs, tables and a bar up there so it was perfect. Since we donated to the fundraiser we got $3 off all appetizers, and thank god for that. $8 for a chicken finger app? Um, sorry but no. We wanted the buffalo chicken dip and loaded fries, but the broiler was broken so we couldn't get either. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, pierogies, and chicken quesadillas. The spinach and artichoke dip was meh, and the chips were MEGA salty. Unenjoyably so, and it was a huge portion for an appetizer. So you're getting your money's worth, anyway. The pierogies were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, came with sour cream and very good. There were 6 in our order. The quesadillas would make an entire meal for one, it was again a huge portion for an appetizer. They were packed with chicken, cheese and bell peppers, and came with more cheese, delicious salsa, sour cream and lettuce to put on top. They were really good. We didn't try the dinner menu since we were trying to save some money and it was a bit pricey, but 2 of our 3 appetizers were good. Out waitress was attentive and was able to put our drinks and food on different tabs with no problem.

Been with them for years... and it has been a roller coaster.

Having moved twice, each time there seems to have been issues.  At one point they were charging me twice (one for the old place and one for the new place), despite getting confirmation that the old place was shut off.

Additionally and most recently, we upgraded a contract about year ago into a package that was ""guaranteed"" to never go up in price, so long as we never made any changes/upgrades/downgrades.  Off the bat, they ordered us a new modem, even though the old one worked.  Afterwards, I got billed for the price of the original because the contracted tech never took it back.  Then I had gotten sent to collections, despite several calls stating they were looking into it.  Seems to have been resolved (hopefully... though I've not heard back again).

Sure enough though, our price went up as they now said that it was only slated for one year.  I've got the contract the kid signed with us which stipulates that but have been told that he was ""mistaken"".  Awesomeness...

Some of us got there a little early and were able to partake in their happy hour drink specials at the patio bar, while we waited for everyone to arrive.  Their beer specials are good, but they're only available at the patio bar...lame. 

We had a reservation for a table on the patio and it was a great, pleasant dining experience.  Their patio is really a nice place to enjoy a good meal, especially with the gorgeous weather we had that evening.
Our server was attentive and we didn't have to wait too long for our entrées to arrive after ordering.  I decided on the Beef Short Ribs with Ricotta Gnocchi after reading P W's review and holy toledo, he was right!  It was absolutely delicious!  The fresh gnocchi was pillowy soft and creamy, cooked just right and the short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth super tender!  I let Dan S and his wife each try a piece of gnocchi and they also enjoyed it. Darren R had a burger which looked really good and and Dan had a pizza, which he said was da bomb yo!  (yeah, he still talks like that in public...)
Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals, even though I couldn't see what my friends down at the other end of the table had ordered.

I think it might be better for takeout since one wouldn't have to deal with the awkward, silent mood set by the older couple who I assume are the owners.

We ordered the $7.00 dine-in bento special.  Note there are absolutely NO substitutions on the bento even for a same-price item (They won't swap the California roll with a cucumber roll.). You'd think they'd be more accommodating when business is so slow, and not be so focused on using their pre-made (and not chilled) California rolls.

The Place was absolutely dead at peak lunch rush time.  No one else came in the entire time.  It was rather sad.

The egg drop soup was very thick/viscous and plain.  It requires me to use the provided soy sauce and pepper.  The pepper shaker was empty and the gentleman (male owner?) had to replace it.  He was stoic, and awkwardly didn't speak or smile.

The music was truly awful.  The silver and black interior is not too bad (they're trying), but it's rather basic.

The chicken katsu was low quality dark meat but moist, with a good crispy crunch of breading on the outside.  It didn't get soggy throughout the meal.  The side of rice was a little small, and slightly dry (I prefer sticky rice).  The deep fried items on the side we're fine, and the sushi was edible but around grocery store level quality.

The woman working (female owner?) wordlessly filled water glasses when needed but did smile until the very end of our meal.  She also barely spoke.

The man and woman sat at a booth on the restaurant floor with a computer while we ate, and the gentleman was making coughing and similar ""sick"" noises, which was off-putting.  He wasn't cooking (the woman vanished into the back so I assume she was the cook - maybe he rolls the sushi or something?), thankfully!

The jack fruit was delicious! My omnivore boyfriend was dumbfounded how yummy it was (mostly the fact jackfruit taste exactly like pulled pork).

The Harvest burrito was a miss, we were both pretty disappointed. The quinoa overtook the whole burrito instead of adding to it.

Not only is it a grocery store, but it's a bakery, cookware, storage, linens, food court, and cosmetic store. 

Let's start with the GROCERY.
The produce is fresh looking, and lots of fruits imported from Korea and Japan. Not your typical Loblaws stock. Although a little more expensive depending on what your'e getting (a small bunch of Rapini was $1.99)

You can also find, SoyBean paste (do it yourself miso soup), different types of kimchi, beef short ribs (kalbi), kalbi sauce, rice cakes, dumplings, japanese ball soda, pre packaged snacks, jap chae potato starch noodles among other things. There are Japanese mochi and cakes too. 
I'm sure if you were Korean, you'll feel more at home here than in a TNT. 

I'm trying to eat healthy, but it was hard to ignore a whole aisle dedicated to instant noodles!! looked so yummy, but I skipped that one. 

LINENS and CHINA
There is a small corner at the back that sells nice fine china dishes. If I didn't have dishes already I would buy them in a heartbeat. They also had pillows and cushions that my mom spent at least 15 mins looking at.

COOKWARE
Theres a whole middle section where you can get your very own stone bowl for rice, or rice cooker, or pans/pot - any thing you can imagine

BAKERY/FOOD COURT
They have tons of premade food in a huge section of the food court. They will heat it up for you or you can order off the menu above the cashier lady at the front. The menu includes noodles, rice with black bean sauce and other quick Korean dishes. Your third option is to get food from the 'buffet' line - packaged by weight at $4/ pound. I got a full box of Jap Chae and Bulgolgi with some veggies and it was only 1.5 lbs. With a 30% discount because it's after 5pm, my mom and I shared a meal for $6 !
The best part? They even have a sink with soap to wash your hands afterwards.

They also have mini cupcakes, which I really love. However, I don't think that is on a regular basis. When I asked them the other time I was told the mini ones are for custom orders. And some times they have some extra ones and those are the ones that end up on their shelves. I wish they would post the availability of their mini cupcakes on the facebook page as well. It will help mini cupcake lovers like it a lot, that way I won't have to call ahead or make a trip down to 'try my luck' haha. The cupcakes are nice, but I find the frosting a little too rich. It's not excessive frosting, just rich. 

Their macarons are good too. I wish there could be less coloring used. For example the vanilla macarons, which is amongst those I like, are a bright blue.

I picked up three of the bunz and a bacon-stuffed hot dog to take back with me as my contribution to our little impromptu soiree.

I wish I could remember exactly what we had (I can't tell from my own photos; I usually snap the menu, just in case)... but one was a curried chicken, one was a pesto (?) chicken and the other was, I think, a pulled pork. (Shoot, was it the mac?)

The important part is that everything was executed PERFECTLY. Just the right amount of bun and stuffing. The flavors were amazing. The texture of the bunz today? Spot-freaking- on. A light crisp to the outside, tender and soft on the inside without being doughy (exactly what I said previously that I was hoping for), and the infused flavors (sun dried tomato!) were excellent. Two very happy thumbs up!

The bacon-stuffed hot dog, I have to say, was the winner for me. Maybe it's because I can't enjoy the bread like everyone else, or maybe it was the kicked up (really spicy in the best way!) garlic aioli. A fantastic bite back from that sauce, not for the weak, and totally worth being subbed in for my salad that afternoon.

The place is modern and clean, the service is average and the ambiance seems a little more sophisticated downtown than cultural in any way. 

I will say that it was more expensive than your average Indian restaurant, but I think that just has to do with the location more than anything. 

We ordered the paneer makhani, naan, and the lamb briyani. Food arrived quickly and it was hot and fresh. The paneer was soft, and the sauce was delicious and very flavourful. The lamb briyani had chunks of lamb and was a huge portion. The rice was well seasoned, and all the different spices could distinctly be tasted. The naan was soft and crunchy in different parts, and was cut up into different sized pieces. We got everything spicy (mild, medium spicy options existed), and there was an actual kick to all the dishes (it was definitely a slow build king of spicy, but it was delicious). 

I would definitely come back, but the price might prevent me from coming frequently.",2018-05-11 15:49:20

 Ordered the pasta bowl.   It was enough for 2 people. The way this place works is you chose your protein, choose the format such as pasta bowl, salad, and or a flat bread.

The the portion of the protein was decent Although I would not get the steak again as it was pretty chewy,  The sausage was quite tasty.  There were 20ish toppings to add to the pasta bowl.   Lots of veggies, cheese, sauces and beans to chose from.  The pasta was cooked a perfect al dente,  By the time I finished creating the bowl it weighed at least 25 pounds. No Shit! 

The only room for improvement is that did not have anything to make the dish spicy. So for all you fellow spice freaks, you may want to bring your own scovil raising capsicum products.",2013-01-08 05:38:10

Last time we stopped, we grabbed a seat at the bar for dinner.  I had the mussels and they were good (not point brugge good though), and my husband got the burger--which he deemed one of the best he'd ever eaten.

Obviously the big draw here is the bar - and the cocktails in particular.  Sometimes I just get the punch, but I will usually order a bourbon drink and they're definitely some of the best ever.

Granted it was Thursday afternoon. I have been to other boil houses like Captain's boil before so I was familiar with the concept of eating out of a plastic bag with gloves on LOL. 

What set this place apart from all those other places is the variety in their menu. They don't just have plastic bags of seafood, but they have plenty of party appetizers, poke bowls, sandwiches, and other stuff. Which is really nice to see especially when going with a big group. 

We ordered two lobster nachos to share, oyster sliders, shrimp in the bag, and the soft shell crab sandwich. I can't tell you which one was the best they were all so flavourful in their own way. The lobster nachos came with a shell of the lobster, the meat was taken out already and placed throughout but the pic for the gram was on point. LOL. The oyster sliders and soft shell crab are definitely a must try when going there! I've never had soft shell crab but after this I will definitely be going back for more. The shrimp in the bag was more flavourful than Captain's boil in my opinion-I got the house blend flavor. 

The decor is also something else. You can tell it was very well put together and thought out. During my visit, we saw two lobsters fighting which was fun LOL

I don't get that nasty cookie that leaves a layer of lard on the roof of my mouth..

Their dishes are decent but there's always something too strong in any one of them that makes them hell for my body to digest (hence the never ending burps).... their black beans are too sweet.. Jade Chicken is too spicy.. Machaca is too salty or overly seasoned...

I tried Go Go Mango, diced mango were being crushed and blended in the ice cream mixture on the cold plate, rolled up when the mixture started to solidify. Topped with diced fresh mango and white chocolate chips. Tasted fresh and surprisingly not very sweet! I love dessert but sadly do not like overly sweet food, so that s a winner for me.

I am NOT a fan of Wal-Mart.  In fact, I avoid them like the plague.  So not only am I uncharacteristically championing a Wal-Mart, I am befuddled by the negative reviews on the ONE Wal-Mart I actually frequent.  Hmmm....

Here's what I like:  You Get In. You Get Out.  There's not a litany of overhead announcements.  There are not piles of crap filling end-caps, so it's easy to get from Point A to Point B.  When you are ready to leave, you are beckoned by a cashier to their lane if they think you don't see them open. 

They may even be mind-readers.  Once during a necessary grocery run at Thanksgiving shopping time, the manager saw me looking at the mayhem which was tons o' people ready to check out at once.  He grabbed the front of my cart and guided me to a lane about to be opened.  Perhaps he sensed my desire to ditch my cart and run.  Maybe he remembers me from another store in the past where I have ditched my cart and run.  Or remembers me from when I've walked in to other insanely busy stores, looked around, and walked out again.  No matter, he anticipated my impending freak-out moment and helped.  Thank  you!


This is NOT a SuperStore.  It is a MINIMALIST Wal-Mart, which was the compromise between the neighbors that fought its very existence here (I admit to being one of those), and Wal-Mart corporate.  

This is primarily a Wal-Mart grocery store, with a smattering of all things Wal-Mart, except on a smaller scale. Nothing gourmet or fancy, but some über competitive pricing which is hard to beat in a down economy combined with a great loss of income.  Alert- NO Plant Nursery area! 

Yes, many of the employees are not natural born citizens.  That doesn't compromise my experience here.  I have never struggled with communication with any of them.  Many employees are long-term:  they recognize you and are friendly.  

I even ran a litmus-test of sorts on this store, with another Wal-Mart doubter.  I took my daughter, who historically regrets any Wal-Mart visit.  I didn't say a word to her about how this was the only Wal-Mart I could bear.  Just made her run errands with me, this one on the list.  We got in.  We got out.  No one got hurt.  As we went to the car she said something to the effect of ""I hate to admit it, but that's a nice Wal-Mart"".  BAM!  

If you are looking for the usual Wal-Mart grocery selection without the drama of a 5-mile hike, 20 minute waits, strangely void of the usual suspects (see peopleofwalmart.com );  no screaming children in diapers lying in the aisle-ways, an unintelligible announcements, this is your store.  If you are looking for a decent Super-Walmart with all the trimmings, minus those said annoyances, go to NorthSight location.",2011-02-21 17:05:41

Might want to not have too much of these during Date Night.  Their menu is full of items for anyone that likes seafood - it would be hard to try them all.

If you find yourself peckish after a late movie or just want some drinks, they have an excellent after 9PM happy hour menu.

Lots of parking at the side of the building near this place.  Don't bother with the underground - never a spot when you need one.

The food is really unique and unconventional. There is a slight twist on everything that makes you want to try just about everything . 

It is more tapas /family style restaurant so going with a small group is perfect because you can try a lot of different things. 

My favorite by far that I tried was the collard greens! Hands down someone threw it down in the kitchen for real with the greens. Literally taste like they stole my mom's recipe and cooked it in the back of the kitchen! FYI my mommy can make some excellent green!

I tried the tofu wings which I was shock at how good they were honestly and I tasted the actual wings which were equally flavorful and delicious.

I was not a big fan of the pimento corn cheese as it was too heavy on the corn side and a weird texture to me. 

The atmosphere is casual but classy as the vibe is just very different than any place in the Queen City. This could be due to the K-Pop that was playing in the background on the televisions. Hearing the Korean version of R Kelly is always fun as this guy was playing drums in an random corn field.

Located down the street from 12 o' Lunch and Sansotei, this recently opened Korean resto offers your standard rice bowls, stews and kim chi. The booth-style layout seats plenty of people but I wished they had a ringer to notify your server like they do in other places.

They're generous with their kim chi dishes, which is a plus, but their main dishes are generally $2-3 more than the local competition. I've tried their DOLSOP BIBIMBAP and various STEWS, which, while not bad, don't seem as flavourful as other places. Granted, there's not a lot of choices within walking distance, but I prefer 12 o' Lunch's BIBIMBAP.

This place reminds me of a condensed Home Plus without the clothing. They sell just about anything you would find in Korea. It's very tidy here. You don't have to worry about stepping over boxes or around large crates.

The produce section is great! Most of the produce you can't find anywhere else. Since the drive is a bit long, I always stock up on my favorite snacks. I also love nodding my head to the k-pop playing as I shop. I'm not a seafood person, but there is a fresh seafood section there.

There is a home good section where you can buy pots, pans, utensils and other goods. 

The food court is amazing too! I love getting japche and dukkbokki. When I was living in Korea, there was a street vendor on my walk home that sold dokkbokki. My home-stay sister and I would stop there and get some just about everyday. I was glad they sold it here. On thing I liked in Korea's food courts specifically was that they don't use Styrofoam as much as we do here. All of their plates, bowls and utensils (beside chopsticks) can be washed and reused. I was happy to see they do the same thing in Greenland as well. The only Styrofoam they use is for the drinking water. And the service is just about the same with the numbers on the screen. I feel as if I'm right back in Seoul.

It'd also be nice if they offered a larger portion.  I'd pay for the larger size, because their portions for Caribbean food are TINY.  I always end up eating my own lunch, and then finishing what my 1-year old son couldn't.  Even my wife, who has a small appetite, can finish her roti.

We all watch Diner, Drive-Ins and Dives and thought it would be fun to stop in to this place that was on the show. The restaurant is a very cool place overall, the staff was very friendly took all six of us to our table at around 1:30 when they close at 2:00 without any fuss. The wait staff was super friendly. I got the patty melt, my wife a grilled ham and cheese, our kids got a waffle and a grilled cheese, and the rest got a chili dog and meat loaf. My patty melt was good, it wasn't gourmet, but I did not expect it to be. The kids enjoyed their food and my wife really liked her grilled ham and cheese. My mother-in-law said the meat loaf was very good and enjoyed the mashed potatoes. My father-in-law like the chili dog, but the chili was quite spicy and he was not very much of a fan. But, overall it was a neat experience. The give this place a three stars because the food is not perfect, but it is good. The ambiance is pretty cool though. It is definitely worth a visit.

I seriously don't think they know how damned great their food it. If they were to move to a new building and modernize the decor they could charge me twice the amount and I wouldn't even flinch. We go pretty much every Friday and hover around 5pm for them to open like stalkers outside some window. Over the 4 years I have been going to this place I have been able to try various dishes and here is my rating on each dish and overall dining experience.

Ambiance: 3/5 The place doesn't have the right flow if you were to visit you would see what I mean. The takeout area is in the middle and the wait to be seated area is around 6 feet from the door and I imagine some people might not be seated due to them not being noticed. The decor isn't much of a date place if you were trying to have the whole package of aesthetics and good food so don't come in thinking it's a Ticoz or Tuck Shop.

Service: 5/5 The best I have ever had, each person is lightning quick they are super friendly and the food comes out so fast it will make your head spin sometimes.

Food:  I don't know how to articulate how great it is.

72- 5/5 Vegetable fried rice with chicken medium spice 5/5 - This is the freshest most flavorful fried rice I have tasted. All the veggies are crisp and tasty. Just add a dash of soy sauce and it is perfection. This is the first thing I tried years ago and ordered repeatedly as well as my whole lunch party for years straight.

25 - 5/5 Chicken, onions, and peppers in medium spice sauce that must be made by the gods themselves it is so flavorful. My current favorite that I order it with extra chicken and extra sauce and it is the best thing I have ever had and is spot on each and every time.

11- 5/5 Thai Angel wings -I have had a few but by far the batter on these stands head and shoulders over any other. I always order these, drown them in the sauce it comes with and it's heavenly.

Beef Panang medium spice 4/5 I am not a curry fan or any thing with similar flavors,except here, they just know how to make brilliant dishes.

Yellow Curry medium spice 4/5 the default choice for most people into thai it seems but this is the first place I tasted it that I genuinely would crave it as I am not a fan of curry.

22-  4/5 chicken with oyster sauce and veggies with hot spice. This one was super one time then ok another time but still a solid dish. Usually a mild flavor so adding hot kicks it up.
29- 4/5 similar to above with cashews with hot spice. Really great also
40 - 4/5 with chicken instead of shrimp with hot spice



Pretty much every dish I have tried from Mango delight to their soups are great. I will mention the food in my own opinion that isn't their strong dishes so they don't ruin your first initial impression if you decide to order them.
3/5 bbq chicken
2/5 fried combination some veggies are good some aren't
2/5 thai toast
2/5 eggplant
2/5 pad thai personal preference though as I dont care peanut sauce
2/5 anything with duck

This review is specific to the Camelback location as the Tempe location started out great but lost a cook and multiple employees most likely due to a ego maniacal manager. That local does have an excellent building and decor and for a time identical food just in smaller portions but having two waitress/waiters for lunch rush lead to bad service and the cook change threw off the taste. I will state I haven't been back for over a year since finally writing it off after consecutive let downs so they may have remedied the issue. The Chandler one is in the family but they don't follow the recipes and do what they want with the dishes and is more of a take out place.",2011-12-09 17:36:28

The prices for the drinks to be served in cute cups are somewhat the typical prices as the other cafes. I just love glass jars i can take home from a cafe. They come in handy for my kitchen creations. But going back to the drinks, i've had the lavender latte! My favorite spot for a lavender latte will always be from Makers and Finders. Their lavender latte had a strong kick of caffeine. Which i love because i didn't need to ask for an extra shot. It just didn't balance out well because i could barely taste the lavender. Although, the drink was great! My friend ordered the Nutella shake and it was so good! They only come in 16oz so you might want to share with someone. It gets a little overwhelming drinking it alone. You keep drinking you start to realize it's a little too sweet. So share it. However if you get a drink that can come in 12oz, stick to the 16oz. 12oz was too little for me!

Mike came out and he was AWESOME!  They are fast, honest, and he was easy to work with.  He did *so* much more work than everyone told me plumbers do - and it was a fair price - AND he told me how to save money - ANNNNNND he DID do a repair.

However, once we were seated, the server was very friendly and accommodating despite the complicated nature of our visit to the yard. I am limited on what I can order, so I simply had tomato soup. It was the best tomato soup I've ever had, and certainly worth $5. Though, I should have ordered just a cup instead of a full bowl.

My friends ordered grilled cheese sandwiches and a veggie burger. Everything looked great, but the grilled cheeses were not grilled. It was dry toast with lightly melted cheese. We were all disappointed. 

The veggie burger, while massive, was quite boring compared to other veggie burgers in the city, so I wouldn't come here for that.

We went here for a special occasion but nothing, nothing made us want to stay.  

* Service - awkward, inattentive, slow
* Food - tasteless salads, excellent entrees, dessert missed the mark
* Atmosphere - loud off putting music, empty strange decor, beat up bathrooms

I had higher hopes based on yelp reviews.  We had a 9:15 reservation and were not seated until 9:30, even though we could see empty tables.  Others who were waiting just decided to leave.

Our waitress should be fired.  She described the food in the most unappealing way possible: ""We don't have a lamb chop, instead we are substituting a lamb leg, it is cut in half at the bone, it has lots of sinew, tendons, connective tissue, so it is pretty chewy and tough, and it looks worse than a chop but it is still really good tasting.""  And, ""Monkfish is really good like lobster, but it is a super gross looking, ugly fish.""  Way to turn our stomachs.

Many different people waited on us.  The person clearing our salads put our dirty knives straight on the table.  At this price restaurant they should bring new silverware with each course, and if not, then at least don't put it straight on the wood top table.  They also cleared things too early, placed things awkwardly, didn't ask if we wanted drink refills.  Did anybody train this staff?

Menu: I understand seasonal cooking doesn't leave many options in January.  But I also think there is a real lack of invention here.  75% of all the dishes had escarole and fingerling potatoes.  It all just sounded the same.  Get more creative with what you have at this time of year.  

Mussel salad was utterly flavorless.  I don't know how you can make a salad that has mussels, fennel, and caper berries that has no flavor.  It sounds impossible, but true.

The monkfish was delicious.  Well seasoned, big piece, tender, lovely tomato accompaniment.  Spanish mackerel was good.  Small.  Could have used a bit more sauce or flavoring.

Warm gingerbread came with ice cold quinces on top and was so slathered in whipped cream it looked like a three year old plated it.  The gingerbread was fine but the fruit should have been warm and saucy.  The whipped cream tasted like cool whip and was about 8 times too much.

At an odd moment, the music started blaring, the Smiths, which I love, and strange dance party music.  Just too off for this type of restaurant.  We had a strange oil lamp on our table that had a tiny blue flame.  There was a big empty wall behind us with a picture hook and no picture on it.  The bathroom has a strange shelf right when you walk in with q-tips and OB tampons in a tray.  Just so odd.

UPDATE: The owner of the restaurant contacted me via yelp and addressed the above concerns point by point.  She did so very respectfully and with tact, which I appreciate.

  This is my eighth Yelp check-in visit in China Garden. Friendly service and quality of the food has consistently been 4 stars.
  My visits have been before 4 pm, the latest time to catch the lunch special. I dine inside.
  Their lunch specials top off at $6.25. Of course, if you dining in, I suggest a tip. Similar to the majority of Chinese restaurants, a shrimp's entry is the top priced item. ($6.25).
  Their lunch special gives a grand portion of quality food for their money. It includes a fountain drink for people dining in (Pepsi products), soup of the day (on every visit egg drop soup), an entree with fried rice and chow mein. 
  My favorite China Garden dishes are the pepper steak, shrimp with lobster sauce, and shrimp chop suey. 
   The chow mein noodles take up a small portion of the plate. I left a few Chinese restaurants slightly let down by too much of the plate filled with ordinary chow mein noodles. For the record, the chow mein noodles are tasty.
 China Garden also cooks NY chow mein. It is a separate combination dish. I tried it, and was not a fan of it.
 China Garden so far, is obviously doing the right thing. My brother, who lives in North Las Vegas, will eat here when he is in Henderson. He recommends the barbecue spare ribs.

we arrived around 6pm on this wednesday evening and there was only one other couple in the entire place. dead. crickets chirping. it's rather odd inside. somewhat tacky and cheap, but i wasn't expecting a fine dining meal. 

we went with the iced tea (spicy!) and the ensalada drink (refreshing!). got the appetizer platter with the meat pie, pupusa, rice, beans, and tamale. the tamale was rather soggy, and the chunks of chicken inside were large chunks and just kind of awkward. the meat pie was cheesey and delicious as was the pupusa. and the rice..well, i could eat that rice every single day! buttery and fluffy is how i'd describe it. for entrees i chose the camaron and carne fajitas and my girlfriend chose the chicken with rice and salad. hers was delicious, mine was meh. it came loaded with onions and the tails were still on the shrimp. the tortillas were different, to say the least, really thick and doughy, i didn't care for them too much.

I gotta say thank you to Adrijana, our server for the evening for her professional attention to our dinner. She had a trainee with her and no glitches to be had. 

Between us two, we ordered scotch, wine, sangria, and no appetizers because, come on, the meat is a yummy appetizer/main course: and dessert. Well, we did have actual dessert too because it was a first night out after so long. We had the Keg Classic: fillet mignon with mashed potatoes, and New York Striploin with mashed potatoes, both medium rare. Deliciously cooked. Just the way we wanted our meat cooked.

I first found out about this place from a coworker who loved going there during packers games because it's known as a ""Packer Bar"". But that is Rum Runner we are talking about, which is connected to Badger Cafe. They both are one and the same, but I'll talk about the food in this review.

The restaurant area is nice and tidy, has a dive / diner type of feel and it's quite busy most of the time. Customer service is great and so is the speed of food delivery (it obvious varies depending on nuts it is inside Rum Runner).

Anyways, $3.99 for a half pound burger plus an additional $1 for extra fries. This is easily one of the better burgers in town, it's a great value no matter how you look at it. I've been a regular here for months now. 

I'm majorly addicted to the fried, they are completely beer battered and are phenomenal tasting. I have no need to add salt or any other seasonings, the fries stand on there own. This and very crispy, just thinking about them makes me want to drive there right now for some fries.  If the owners are reading this, add another item on your menu that is a bucket of fries for $4.99 or something. I will be there every day!

The parking area is mostly packed for reasons I don't understand and it's around a quite questionable neighborhood. The appeal of this place is similar to my favorite bar back in Michigan, it's in a rough neighborhood with some scumbags hovering around (I guess that's why my coworker has been going there for years, scumbag) but the food is so great. It's like an urban risk/reward game, maybe I'll get hassled by hobo's, or maybe I'll get an awesome deal and meal. 

It get's extra points for being able to order from inside the cafe and they will bring the food out to Rum Runner for you. 

Food, Deals, Service, it's got all of that. I strongly recommend  coming here if you can!

The decor is sleek and modern with an intimate atmosphere. The rest rooms were even classier.  All you need now is caucasian servers and well presented but overpriced Chinese food... check and check!

All jokes aside, the servers were friendly and attentive, and the food was in fact presented well and tasted great too.

We started off with the calamari appetizer which arrived in a nice little fried wonton basket with a delectable sweet chili sauce. It was good, but not Sushi Rock good.  For the main course, I played it safe and went with the Honey Sesame Glazed Chicken, which also arrived in a fried wonton basket, with broccoli and two triangle shaped packs of rice coated in sesame seeds. I loved it. Sesame chicken is a very ""tired"" dish, but Wild Mango definitely separated themselves from the average takeout joints. The crispy/juicy chicken, the sweet sesame sauce... excellent. The sauce ended up being a bit too heavy towards the end, and as much as I wanted to leave no trail of that wonton basket behind, I couldn't finish it. Also, the rice was a bit dry.

Others in my party ordered:

- Bouillabaise - wow, this could feed a family. I didn't get a chance to taste it but by all accounts it was good.
- White Truffle Chicken - this was OK. The sauce was a bit too garlicky.
- Seared Tuna and Sea Scallop - good, but would not fill me up at all.
- Chicken Trio - did not get a chance to try but the one who ordered it was not wowed.

Let me set the scene - nice ambiance, attentive service, zero vegan options.  Lots of vegetarian, but nothing vegan (with the possible exception of a salad.)  However, our server was on the ball and they rustled up some egg-free pasta in the back of the kitchen and left the ricotta off the linguine pomodoro.  

I had the pasta ($19) and a glass of Sangiovese ($14), which made for about a $40 dinner with tax, tip, etc.  The pasta was pretty delicious I will say.  Definitely high quality tomatoes, olive oil.  Very simple but well executed.  But I felt like I didn't have $40 worth of dinner.  

Bottom line - not worth it to me to pay that much for that little, but I would gladly go again if someone else were footing the bill or if I got in on the 1/2 off locals deal that Adina mentions below.

The South End location has a sizable outdoor patio that's fairly comfortable but I would only recommend lounging outside if you enjoy choking on cigarette smoke.

We popped in for lunch and were seated right away.  Our server came by and gave us the scoop on the different types of pizza and the ordering process.  We decided on what we wanted, which was our go to of pepperoni and mushrooms on the regular pizza.  We then sat and waited for our pizza to come out while smelling all of the pizzas around us.  We were salivating like rabid dogs just from the wonderful aromas drifting this way and that!  Nothing really smells better than fresh baked pizza in my book! Yummmm.

So when our beautiful pepperoni and mushroom pizza arrived, we attacked the pie like no one's business.  The first bite I took resulting in me seeing fireworks going off.  I totally had a party in my mouth.  All I can say about the flavor is AMAZING!  I was in love from the first bite.  By the time I had finished my lovely first slice, my hubby was on his 3rd piece.  I don't think he was taking time between bites to breathe or even chew.  He was in pizza ecstasy!

We are now Grimaldi's lovers!  It has been added to our list of regular pieces to visit.  They have an email club and if you plan on going, I would sign up for it.  They send decent coupons pretty regularly and even a free pizza for your birthday!  I had actually signed up for the email club before we went.  I love a good coupon!

I was there on a Thursday at noon, and the wait was roughly 40-50 minutes. We got seated when it was out turn. It was chilly outside, so one of the servers brought out some mint tea in disposable cups. How nice! 

Ordered the Cairo classic and mind blowing chicken. The portions were big, and the prices were fair. But... never have I ever seen a brunch spot charge for drip coffee by size. And it didn't  seem like there  was significant difference between the small and medium. And to top it off, I didn't love the coffee. 

The food was very good! Everything was spicy - not heat, but bold flavours. That's what differentiates Maha's from most brunch spots. As most people mentioned, it did take a while for the food to come out, which doesn't help the table turnover at such a busy restaurant. We had the window seat, and I actually ate quickly because I felt very self conscious about the line of people watching me ""take my time"". It's in my head, but still, faster service would have made it better.

Long story: Not sure what to expect when I pulled up due to the outside appearance but I was on a short time limit so I figured why not try. From the outside, I couldn't even tell if this place was open or not. The large building sign seemed old and faded and the ""open"" sign in the window was not turned on. I asked a lady standing outside (who worked next door) if this place was open and she indicated it was. I was greeted as soon as I walked in by a friendly host/server and had my choice of tables as I was one of three ppl dining for lunch. As a solitary diner, I am always a bit put off by an empty dining room or awkward environment but I shrugged it off as another culinary adventure. Glad I did. While the dining room is (as some reviewers pointed out) empty and random like a ""temporary cafe"", I kind of dug it. I'm not a food snob by any means but I appreciate good food from an unassuming place. Soon after being seated I was offered potato skins, which I declined due to personal taste but they did smell good. I had a few moments to look around and the decor was almost there but just too random. Almost like a studio apt decorated by a guy with good ideas but no clue about style, design & placement. The lunch menu was short and sweet and I was torn between the Brie Grilled Cheese and the Grilled Chicken Panini. Based on the recommendation from my friendly server, I choose the panini. Since I was one of very few ppl, my lunch came out quickly and was presented beautifully. Fries were my chosen side and unfortunately a bit too greasy and floppy if you know what I mean (I always prefer them crunchy!). My sandwich was DELICIOUS (Hence the 3 stars)! Perfectly grilled chicken on yummy warm crispy bread and melty cheese and veggies. Super flavorful and not greasy. 
While the atmosphere isn't anything to write home about, my lunch was great. I WILL be back to try something new! 
**side note** I asked my server how long they'd been open and to my surprise he said about 2 yrs. The business was orig started as a catering company and the cafe opened as a ancillary part of the biz due great response.

Newks + Lunch Hour in Uptown = Trainwreck

Breadsticks flying, angry mobs of ""to go"" patrons flocking around the kitchen, confused/harried staff running everywhere, people jockeying for position to get a table/beverage refill..... It felt like I was dining in downtown Beirut.  The restaurant layout is horrible.  They need to reduce the amount of tables in this place by about 30-40% in order for people to be able to dine comfortably.  But of course, that doesn't sit well with the corporate management, who are willing to pack the place like sardines, with dollar signs in their eyes.

The food is ok, but who in the heck keeps clicking the ""$"" is beyond me.  I guess if you are comparing this place to the Capital Grill, ok...I can see one ""$"".  But for a deli, this place easily warrants ""$$$"".  By far the most expensive deli in the area, when price to value ratio is taken into consideration.  Steer clear of the ""Grab-N-Go"" fridge section, unless brown, wilted lettuce is your thing.  Funny thing to note: they have the prices blanked out on their online menu.  Why do you think that is, I imagine?  So you don't know what you are going to be out of pocket, for a sandwich, until you are already inside and it's too late for you and your colleagues to try another spot?

Redeeming quality is in the portion size.  But then again, when you are paying that type of money for SOUP, I expect it to be served in a gallon milk jug.

Verdict:  Plenty of better sandwich and salad options in Uptown, especially if you are willing to spend this type of money for this type of food.",2011-06-08 17:05:11

We've always passed it and I figured, why not give it a go. So we went, mind you it's a Saturday and everyone and their moms are out. 

Parking wasn't bad, but you have it in a plaza with a bunch of other places which makes it kind of tight to park. Found a spot near the Carl's Jr.

We walked in and there were two people behind the counter, one making the stuff and the other one handling customers. My girlfriend and I walked in not knowing what to get, luckily there wasn't anyone behind us. The guy handling the register left to help the girl to make items, it's all good.

We waited for about 8 minutes give or take until the girl came up to ring us up. We ordered 3 juices and 2 açaí bowls. It's pricey so it was about $46, eh kinda expensive but health and wellness I guess. Even though la bonita for a large is $4.

1. Cosmetics store: overpriced, you can find most brands for cheaper at other places like hmart, t&t or order online. There's a spa at the back, and they also sell magazines and DVDs and offer delivery/courier services.

2. Bakery: unsanitary. They ask you to pick up things with a thong and put them on trays, but the trays are all dirty, and most pastries don't have paper underneath. Other Asian bakeries that I've been to that also do the tray system keep their trays clean. When I asked for a paper bag so I could put my pastry straight in it, the girl pointed at the dirty trays. Oh and the pastry I got (eclair) was very stale

3. Prepared foods section: the katsu and other croquettes are stale and overpriced. There was one older white woman buying a dozen of croquettes so I assumed they were good! At 2.5 to 3$ a patty, they were mediocre at best.

They were both  quite good although I didn't see or taste any cheese in the roll so I asked the proprietor who told me it is mixed in with the bacon and other meats.  Don't expect traditional Yankee bacon either.  It's almost undetectable when combined with the other meats in the mix.  The puff pastry was very flaky and tasty.  Their rolls are hardy and filling.  The Lamington was a sweet surprise - a sort of sponge cake wrapped in a chocolate gnash sprinkled with coconut.

I remember going here for some great shows, and then I remember it go into decline.  I remember it coming back too.  And, at this point, it never fully came back.  It feels beat up and old without much attention to keeping its aged nature vibrant and in good condition.  The pics from 2006 look awesome, but it feels kind of like a hole in real life.  It's also hot and dirty feeling these days.  This is not the place to hit up for a summer concert, for sure.  The sound quality in the Theatre seems pretty good but it's garbage in the Ballroom.  I'm lucky to be able to make out anything from a singer in the Ballroom.  

My biggest complaint deals in booking.  They have way too many opening bands at these shows.  All of the opening acts not part of any tour seem to be forced into the earn your slot by selling tickets.  That's fine in theory, but when you're a band competing against 8 other opening acts, the ability to sell tickets and market lowers.  It's not a good thing for the local music scene.  And for the concert goer, it means the main acts don't go on until really late and you might have to sit through a ton of stuff to where your ears are just tired by the end of the night.  I don't bother going to these shows until later now, but that means I don't really get to support the local music scene.  Over all, I think it's detrimental to pushing Cleveland music forward.

I would say this place is 3-stars in terms of being a venue from the concert-goer's experience.  It's 1 star in terms of how it deals with booking a show bill and working in the local scene.",2014-06-30 19:07:58

Apparently the site used to be an iHop but I would not have known it at all. They had it decorated really cool. It is your basic diner set up with stools at a counter and then a bunch of booths but there are a few glam touches like cool fabric patterns and light fixtures.

The menu is likewise basic diner food glammed up a bit. Hubby had a burger and fries which he said was pretty good. I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup which is always a favorite meal of mine no matter where I order it. The soup was creamy and delicious. The sandwich was made with Havarti cheese and had shredded beef brisket in it with a bbq sauce on it that really went well with the cheese. The bread was griddled so that it had the perfect crunch to it. The sauce on the beef was a bit too sweet but other than that it was really delicious. I loved the pomegranate iced tea as well... they do have some alcoholic drinks but we did not partake that evening.

By the end of the meal we were both satisfied and happy. Our server brought out the check stuck into a '50s dime store paperback novel which I thought was a cute touch. I think this is a great option for dinner before a show at Gammage (it is right across the street) and so I am sure I will be back.",2014-12-04 18:33:59

2. They are constantly coming out with new and improved designs. I come in here at least once a month and there is always something new to see (and buy, though my wallet wishes otherwise).

3. The staff is always on point. They are super welcoming and friendly. Huge plus in my book.

I don't live on the Hender-tucky side of town so rarely do we ever go to the Green Valley Ranch for a visit.  But with getting that Station Casinos coupon buy one buffet get one FREE just about every month (a wonder what $20 a month gambling with their members card can do) we finally gave in and took the trek down there.  I know, I know the coupon is good for the Red Rock Casino too but with over 25 check ins there (yep and I'm still only 5th place for a regular) I thought it was time to change it up a bit.  Glad we took the journey!

We went on the most expensive nights, Saturday for dinner.  Since it includes prime rib & shrimp for the buffet on this night the price goes up to $17 a person + tax & tip.  But with our BOGO coupon 1 is FREE!  Oh yeah!  That is a deal to me!  Don't care if people say buffets are 'whack' or 'the stuff no one wants to eat'.  Save it all for me then!  Eating on a budget is hard enough as it is, but doing it with a buffet?  Yeah, sign me up.  Let's see...$10 each after coupon for all I can eat of just about anything, or $10 each trying to pick out food to cook from my local supermarket?  I like to cook but nope, that BOGO coupon is tough to beat.  Plus, no clean up!

For us, the Feast Buffet at Green Valley Ranch didn't disappoint.  Yes, there are lines, yes, there are crowds for high ticket items (like prime rib), and yes, some of the food is downright mediocre.  But tell me where you gonna get as much meat as your fatty mcfatfat self wants, when you want it?  Don't get me wrong, quality is just as important as quantity...but that's why you only eat the things at a buffet that entices you!  Don't be wasting your calories on those rolls of bread!  Skip the cottage cheese please!  

And believe me, we ate like kings!  Prime rib, which was actually pretty good by the way!  Rare!  With au jus!  And a side of roasted mushrooms!  Pad Thai that was actually edible!  Orange Chicken that whaddaya know?  Tasted like there was real orange in there!  Roasted Brussel Sprouts!  Sauteed Broccoli Rabe!  Carne Asada Tacos!  Hell I could have got Mongolian BBQ made for myself too!  The list goes on & on.

Had a rarity in the buffet, made to order Gyros!  They honestly weren't that great (or that pretty) but it was offered!  Choices!  I like me some choices when it comes to food because half the time I don't know what I want to eat.  Buffets fill that perfect medium.

This Feast Buffet even offers shakes & malts!  Really!  Not a bad way to end the evening after your feast.  

Overall the food was more than decent, some really good stuff in there.  Why go to a buffet expecting Michelin star food?  This my friends is not the place.  Go here to enjoy the food, enjoy your company!  Do what they want you to do.....FEAST!

I also absolutely hate the flavor of curries.  And yes, I won't eat Indian food or other related food either.  Sorry don't hate me yelpers!

But this low review is mainly because this restaurant seems to have problems with just cooking basics.

I don't know why but I was in the mood for good pad thai outside of Chinese delivery, and Pin Kaow 3 delivers to my area after 5pm.  So I got for myself and my husband the following:  

-Shrimp and Tofu Pad Thai 
-Stuffed Chicken Wings 
-Beef Jerky (One sun beef)
-Mee krob
-Beef noodle soup

The pad thai and beef jerky were very good and cooked well.  My husband enjoyed the soup.  However, the stuffed chicken wings were overcooked so much they were practically petrified.  When I bit into one, I couldn't tell which was chicken and which was the stuffing, so I threw it away.  Really awful!  The Mee krob was all sweetness and no counterbalance of acid, and hardly any protein.  It was just too overwhelming so I also threw it away.

I don't think I'd order delivery again but I would do take-out just for the pad thai.",2010-10-08 18:22:11

 I read all the reviews with people complaining about small portions, but I have to state the opposite. I love going to a restaurant and actually finishing most of my meal. Americans are used to eating substantially bigger portions than the rest of the world. I don't think the portions are small,  they are just not gordo portions you see in most Mexican establishments.

And it certainly has it.  The Act - a nightclub featuring random, short performances that are daring, sexual, and at times, borderline obscene.  

From the creators of the nightclub ""The Box"" located in England, we have this new space: A sassy, sexual burlesque feature of short song/music/acrobatic performances that certainly is something different.  The creators had a curveball thrown at them with The Act since The Box featured outright nudity and virtually no censors and it was considered okay by local laws.  However, here in Vegas it's a different ballgame with different rules and laws.  Not to say that it isn't somewhat shocking to some.  An individual in my party, a Jehovah's Witness, was bothered enough to leave after twenty minutes.  So if you're easily offended, (As the emcee, a post-performer from Cirque du Solei's Zumanity screams, ""Take your f##king clothes off!"" to the audience and two clockwork pop-and-lock dancers get high on coke and perform an off-the-wall hyperspeed sex scene), then this might not be the space for you.  Although the contortionist who fired a bow with her toes while doing a single handstand stole the show.  Awesome.  

The interior:  Luscious.  As in I wish my house resembled this.  Not a far throw from The Artisan, gorgeously decorated with classic, traditional designs, wall sconces, polished wood, and brass fixtures, winding corridors, narrow passageways that dipped and varied.  Unisex bathroom, lots of antique furniture and pieces.  A mite small, though.  I'd be concerned about a crowd here as we didn't have that many people out there with no line and it was comfortable inside.  Chronic problem of small dance floor, but even some of the best clubs in Vegas (Marquee/Tryst) have the same problem.

The music: Popular club songs that I've heard on the radio.  Nothing crazy, but with this much insanity and organized chaos, I imagine that you need a pinch of something mainstream.  Toca's Miracle was a nice throwback.

The staff: I SALUTE whoever hired the staff.  Polite.  Helpful.  I was called sir several times.  My date and I came to join a table for a birthday and there was no hassle.  The door man struck up a conversation with us as we left, encouraged us to come back and check out the various nights as the acts varied from night to night.  Everyone was very relaxed, eager to succeed, and the performers were teeming with confidence.  I hope the best for this space - it's awesome, arty and off-beat just enough to make me want to return and see what else this place is going to put out.  And that is what entertainment is all about.",2012-11-11 03:43:49

First impression: the soup is incredibly oily with a thick floating layer of orange grease, but somehow it had no flavor, complexity, or spice. All I tasted was oil, even after I tried stirring to get to the broth. It was almost inedible. However, the tendons were absolutely perfect, gelatinous and tender, so I gave it another shot. Second time around, I asked the kitchen for less oil. Once I got home, I skimmed off the top layer of orange grease using a spoon. I added two lime slices, basil, additional chili sauce, and a squirt of hoisin. It was incredible!! I think reviewers who are commenting the broth is flavorless is drinking the soup as it comes.

The fajitas and fish tacos were average (could use a bit of zest), however,  the guacamole was delicious...once we could actually eat it. It took multiple servers at least 15 minutes before one of them brought us chips (we had to ask three different employees). Imagine the torture! It was a beautiful mountain of avocado, onions, cilantro, and lime juice in a stone bowl sitting right in front of us. Besides being ""forgetful"" about the chips, we had to ask two different people for napkins and silverware and our drinks took over 10 minutes. I considered giving them the benefit of the doubt, but it wasn't a packed house. On the contrary, it was 3pm and only a handful of parties on the patio. Overall, the service left us feeling neglected. Our server didn't come around to check on us and never asked how our entrees were (which we could have used limes). Side note, the salsa was great and you can make it hot to order.

The patio is a sweet place to be. Just be flexible to move your chair around your table as the sun sets on the Ritz Carlton. Open seating, spacious, and in the center of it all...nice!

If Vida can greatly improve communication between the waitstaff and train their servers to be more attentive and friendly this place would be a 4-star due to the location, the price, and the atmosphere.

Upon entering, you are in a small loungey area with lots of long bench style seats and chilled out vibes. Walk through to the main part of the building and you've got more loungey seats and couches with a sexy red glow of lighting along the north and east side of the room, a giant bar fills the middle, a decent sized dancefloor and dj booth fills the space on the westside of the main room, and then you've got the pool tables in the southside of the main room. So you can chill and shmooze, you can dance, or you can play some billiards, what more could one need?

Lots of great dj's can be found here on the regular and you can pretty much hear anything from hip hop to funk and soul to house and electro to even the occasional drum and bass selections depending on the night. My only complaint is that while the entire place has put lots of money in nice furnishings around the venue, the dancefloor has no lights! Any proper dancefloor should have at least 1 rotary lighting setup, be it even just a disco ball or a gobo light or something to create the illusion of movement which helps a dancefloor seem less stagnant. Instead it just has the same red lighting that is around the loungey areas. Now don't get me wrong, the dj's still turn the dancefloor out on most occasions, but like I said, its the one obvious thing that the place should have that has been overlooked over the years I've been visiting, and others have agreed with me so I know I'm not the only one who feels that way.

Some things I like about working out here is... the parking garage, newer machines & weights, large variety of machines, way less congested w/ other lifters than Gold's. The other patrons AS WELL AS THE EMPLOYEES at 24 seem to be a lot more polite and nicer/friendlier too. I also like how the water fountain has a spigot to fill your water bottle. Sometimes it's the simpler things in life that make it complete. 

This location in particular is a mini 24 so there's no pool, etc but they did manage to get a good bit of weights and equipment in there. No stupid card to lose, they're hi-tech using finger print scanners.

Some things I dislike are...lack of benches, only 2 available that adjust. Also the lack of a few machines that i liked at Gold's. Last the limited amount of rear delt/fly machines. I always have to wait for this one but at least if I ask to work in w/ them my odds are better at 24 that they won't sigh and huff & puff b/c I asked. How rude the Gold's patrons tend to be! I'm not the one holding up the machine, sitting on it spending 10 minutes on my iPhone! What kind of work out are they really getting?

Upon looking around I see nothing but mouth watering pastries. Tarts, squares, buns and cakes. All looks fantastic! The first time I was here I left with a fresh butter tart and carrot cake. Butter tart was too fresh and as a result the butter was still liquid and things got real messy. Carrot cake was delicious. Staff was great.

Second visit I made sure I went a bit earlier during the day to have a better selection. Bought the peanut butter tart, cinnamon bun and carrot cake. Peanut butter tart was something I've never had before. Tasted like a nice mix of peanut butter with cream cheese on a nice flakey butter crust.

To start with, for such a small menu, everything, and I mean everything, on it is delightful.  The menu is as diverse as the people who frequent it with vegan, vegitarian, and omnivorous cuisine.

Though some similar establishments can create sensory overload, the Weary Traveler thankfully falls short of the kitsch-y quality that is the trap of so many restaurants.

As for the food - I love the shredded salad. I love the sides. I love the steak and I love the drinks. They truly do cater to your whims and they seem to really take pride in what and how they serve what they do.

First of all if your planning on having a wedding or any reception here, I don't recommend Brio Tuscan Grille for it.

While the wedding party was saying their speeches, all I can hear was plates being bang left and right, the staff having LOUD conversations and overall a ton of feedback. 

The food that was severed was family style. We had a chicken dish (very dry), fish was pretty good (that's what my one star rating is for), pasta (was alright) bread and salad (not enough dressing). The food presentation was so messy and dirtying looking. 

Very upsetting on how they rushed us the whole dinner. They should have slowed down on clearing our plates and focused more on customers service and filling up our water.

During weekday lunch period, the parking spaces closest to Bahama Buck's are very hard to find unoccupied.  But if you are worried about long lines and the associated wait time for getting your shaved ice on, do not worry your pretty/handsome faces.  The occupants of those vehicles all appear to be at the sandwich or the other fast casual dining operations adjacent to this destination.

Even if you have to wait briefly to place an order or for the order to be made fresh, there are two Bahama Buck's TV playing GoPro and Monsters footage of people doing amazing adventurous stuff that most of us may never get around to attempting in our existence here.  My eyes are usually so glued to the TVs that my order of the umbrella topped shaved ice, soaked of food coloring packed flavor syrups, is ready for the hand off before I think I should get impatient.

Their shaved ice is pretty fine, not like ""snowflake"" powdery fine, but definitely not the chunky small crushed ice I have had at the state fair in my teen years.

I like tart/sour flavors, so that segment of their menu is the only category of flavors I have personal encounters with.  Is it really all that tart? Not in my opinion, but it is still a refreshing treat when the temperature goes back up.  I do however warn against getting the Blue Raspberry flavor, the taste is fine, but what comes out at the end has an interesting and shocking color effect.

Besides shaved ice, they have smoothies and even coffee drinks.  I have seen others order the smoothies,but I have not been there frequently enough to be present when coffee based items are ordered.

If you plan to frequent this business, be sure to get a stamped (punch) card.  When the weather is really cold, you could earn 2x, 3x and even 4x  ""polar punches"" starting when the temperature dips under 50, 40 and 30 degrees, respectively.  

Bonus:  Color changing spoons are amusing for the kids. Come here enough times and you can build up your own collection of miniature umbrellas for your next paradise themed cocktail party staycation.  Until then enjoy the nice weather we are currently having.

I figured that's not a big deal, but after I got my food, no one came by to see if I needed water or wanted anything else, etc. And when I finished, I sat there and waited patiently for someone to ask if I wanted anything else or to give me the bill. 

Anyway, the lesson I learned is that maybe to avoid them during lunch time! Because the other timees I've gone there, the service was fine! The important thing: the ramen's pretty good. It's hard to compare the ramen here vs. other places in Toronto because I kinda like them all for different reasons. The spicy miso here was particularly good, but so are the other ones. Their happy hour menu is a good deal too: ramen + karaage + drink was like only $10). 

Long review short: it's pretty good!",2013-05-13 17:32:36

(Think mirrors, neon lights, palm trees, and flamingos.) If the tables were bolted to the floor, you'd swear you were on the S.S. Celebration. And that's a good thing, in my book.

When we first moved to Vegas in the late '90s, we would bring every out-of-town guest here. I'm not sure when that tradition fell by the wayside, but it's time to reinstate it.

Although we probably haven't been back in five years or more, nothing has changed since my first visit. Same gaudy decor. Same '70s music. Same great diner food. And, as far as I can tell, same prices. It may be a bit steeper than other places in town, but the prices are a steal for the Strip and the portions are so huge that you can pull two or even three meals out of one entree.

That was certainly the case for my Cobb salad, which was just as big -- and delicious -- as I remember it. I ate a quarter of it for dinner and had leftovers for three more meals! My husband ordered The Conquest, which is a glorified roast beef sandwich, with a side of onion rings. I think they may have changed the recipe on the rings -- they seem to be more panko-y and less beer batter-y -- and the portion seemed bigger than in the past. But they were great, and as I said before, they may be the only thing that's changed since 1998.

After dinner, we stopped in the lounge for a cocktail. Visiting the lounge is an event in itself. More mirrors, more neon, and a circular fire pit to entertain you and your date while you soak up the vibe. I usually get a mai tai, but I was so stuffed from dinner that I got something a little lighter: a Chambord lemon drop martini. It was a little sweet for my taste, but my husband's pineapple mojito was pretty tasty. And, once again, the prices were on par or lower than other bars on the Strip: less than $20 for both. 

Do yourself a favor and take a step back in time next time you're on the Strip. The Peppermill is open 24 hours, so this hot tub time machine is always ready for a party.",2014-05-28 02:52:51

When I come here after 11 pm it seems they have way too many customers and not enough servers. I try to stick to coming here for lunch or in the early evening dinner but after a concert or night out on the town this cafe is open 24 hours and has pretty good late night specials. While out with some friends and it being after 1 am we decided on coming here. 

We were seated right away but as usual because of the hour it was, there was just not enough servers and service was slow. The following prices are from the ""All-Nighter Boarding Pass Specials Menu"" so you will need to have your stations boarding pass handy. 

I had the ""2 Egg Bacon Skillet"" priced at $3.99. My bacon was burnt and hard as a red rock (pardon the pun tee-hee) so I passed on eating anymore of the bacon then what I already disgustingly ate. The eggs were good, the hash browns were good even though they didn't add the cheddar cheese I requested when ordering, and the sourdough toast had way too burnt grill marks on certain sides. They did bring the cutest little jelly jars to the table in grape and strawberry. I used one to try and cover the burnt taste of my toast but did keep the others. I figure I can make a PB&J sandwich with it at home which will taste better. My hubby had the ""Short Stack"" priced at $1.99, ""Biscuits & Gravy"" priced at $1.99and a side of sausage. He enjoyed his meal. The pancakes were actually really good and priced perfectly. My friends ordered the ""Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs"" priced at $4.99 and the ""NY Strip Steak & Eggs"" priced at $5.99. We like to sample each others and one of my friends said her chicken fried steak tasted sour. I tried a bite and it had NO flavor. The server was kind enough to remove the charge from the bill. We all shared a ""Tiramisu Cup"" and it was more like a custard with no flavor.

I got the Old Fashioned to drink, and soppressata to eat and they were both excellent!! Soppressata was two medium eggs, toast, and cream sauce (tasted like a bechamel sauce) with some kind of meat (tasted like bacon but soppressata means salami so maybe it was that). So delicious! Came with a generous portions of sliced fingerling potatoes, and mesclun salad. If it wasn't barbaric, I would've licked my plate clean of the bechamel like cream sauce... Instead I tried to salvage all the sauce by dipping my potatoes in it. Old fashioned was cold espresso with orange. I love that it was served over an ice ball in a whiskey glass. I wish I could request all my iced coffee to be served over an ice ball, it's so pretty! 

When I walked in, a couple of employees greeted me and walked me through how publicus works. Lots of awesome coffee options (it was described to me as cocktail coffees, which is perfect), pastries, and food options (they still had their breakfast items available when I visited at 2:30PM, yay!) 

The vibe& atmosphere in publicus is great! Very clean and modern. Lots of natural lightning (wrap around windows) which make reading/working there a breeze, and lots of seating options (most on the main floor area, some picnic like tables near the Windows, some more hidden near the back walls/bathrooms, etc).

The first time we went there, I discovered a roach so my friend killed it. They gave us free dessert, lol. I was hoping for, hey half off your meal or something. 

Anyways, the sashimi is pretty yummy (second time I came it was alright, some seemed a bit tough and not as melt in my mouth type). So I guess it's a hit and miss sometimes. I like their sui mai a lot esp dipped in that spicy mayo, yum yum! I haven't really tried their rolls because I was busy eating other items and I like more raw fish rolls. I wasn't too crazy about their ahi poke because its a mixture of other fish and it's more like a sashimi salad but not really. I've definitely had better though. 

The dessert selection sucks and it's not part of the all you can eat. they are quite pricey too. A scoop of ice cream I think is like $3. I'm better off going to the store buying a big box for that much, lol. 

The funniest thing I thought about this place was that after 11pm they have a ""beautiful lady"" discount. And I joked with my friend saying, what if the girl is ugly? lol. 

Their customer service isn't all that great. Not attentive but I guess as long as they come back to fill my water cup I'm okay.

However, I gave her a chance especially since my feet were already in the water!!!

She was more interested in watching the people around me than paying attention to me. I was done in 45 minutes which included polishing. She didn't get started right away either on my appointment time so it was actually 30 minutes. That is way too fast for a Spa Pedicure and I'm usually in here for an hour and a half for a pedi.

It's a no frills kind of burger restaurant with some paintings on the wall and a minimal menu selection (burgers, fries, and drinks).

We each ordered the Rudy Burger which consisted of a cheeseburger, lettuce, tomato, and ""Rudy Sauce"" and a side of fries.  Their Rudy Burger is on the smaller size of burgers.  Even when I saw their photos on Instagram, I thought that they resembled the ones from our American neighbour, Shake Shack.  I was really excited to try these and see how they fared. 

It didn't take too long for the staff to bring out our order.  

The burgers indeed did look like the ones from Shake Shack with a soft squishy bun and small size.  We tried the fries first and weren't very impressed because they were over-salted and also just didn't taste very good; they were just regular fries really.  Because there was so much salt on the fries (you could visibly see the huge salt particles on the fries), we banged the fries against its container to get as much salt off as possible.  

Next, we tried our Rudy Burgers.  At first bite, I really liked them!  My burger was a little bit on the raw/undercooked side but I was fine with this.  It made the patty really soft and I liked it.  I loved the cheese on it; it was so melted and tasty and did remind me of the Shake Shack ones again.  

Overall, I did like the burgers and understand the hype about them.  They're almost like the Canadian counterpart of the Shake Shack burgers (for now).  (They also seemed a little greasier in comparison too.)  Personally, I think that if someone hadn't tried the Shack Shake burgers, they would think the one from Rudy is the best thing ever.  However, since we were obviously comparing the two, these ones didn't hold up against the U.S. giant.

For vegetarians, this place IMO has the best vegie offerings I've seen in the GTA for ramen. I've been trying to find a good ramen place for so long, everywhere I've had ramen in the GTA it was ok...... but from the first bite of Ramen Isshin's ramen and first sip of their broth, I was transported back to Japan. For me more than any other dish, Japan ruined Ramen for me and I always compare ramen to the ramen I had there. I don't do that with many cuisines, I think chefs outside a dish's country of origin can even make it better than the local versions (I've had better Italian in Toronto than Italy for example, or for that matter better Italian in Korea than Italy). But ramen, I don't know why it's just one of those personal things where I just couldn't find THE spot for it I liked.

Ramen Isshin's ramen internally brought me to tears with joy. I had the SPICY VEGETARIAN RED MISO RAMEN  w/ Red Dragon paste added to it. MY co-diner had a meat ramen with a rice don and had the same loving reaction I had. The noodles were perfect, had the perfect texture and flavor. The broth was just so damn flavorful, it tasted like it took 30 hrs to make. It was so good that I had some pho the next day which I eat a lot of, and I just thought to myself ""How can I ever have noodles again that are not from Ramen Isshin?"". I'm addicted to this place for life. Bravo!",2017-06-19 14:05:27

It's not how you would picture a ""pool hall"" to be, but there are ample tables in the back, a lounge area and a dance floor. The decor is really neat and it has a really nice ""ambiance"" to it. I love coming here when I need my ""dance fix"" but want to steer clear of the dreaded club district. 

Every time I've come they have played a different type of music so I would suggest checking their website to make sure its something you're going to enjoy that night. The dance floor gets pretty crowded so prepare to get nice and close with whoever is there that night. The drinks are pretty typically priced and the crowd has always been a mix of people, hard to distinguish a specific type. I think the cover might work on a before/after a certain time basis but I've always been charged five dollars, which isn't horrible. I think they have also put in a patio area pretty recently, I've seen it during the day walking by, so that's a major plus for when the weather gets nice (if it ever does!)

Saturday 1:00pm - We return home from class and I have lunch for all of us in tote.  I sit the bag down on this little patio table we have next to our swing.  Upon set down, hundreds if not thousands of these little bugs fall to the ground from under the table.  I look around... and utter to myself....WTF is this sh*t?!?!  They weren't ants.  They weren't beetles.  I have NO CLUE what the hell these things are that are all over. Slight panic sets in.  

Saturday 5:00pm - These little bugs are starting to take over the front of the house.  They're EVERYWHERE.  Carport, front yard, planter box, wall of the house...EVERYWHERE. There were easily a million of these bugs, if there were 1.  My step-dad stops by the house to have a look and he's stumped too.  His suggestion - go to Ace and pick up some spray.  As I'm heading to Ace, I realize how big of a problem I have on my hands and I break out my phone and search for Pest Control on Yelp, filtering by Open Now. 

Up pops Arizona Pest Squad with the 66 reviews and 4.5 stars.  I call, thinking that I wouldn't be able to have someone come out until Monday.  Wrong!  Oh was I so very wrong.  David told me he would be by around 7pm and said that since I was within a certain radius, it was a discounted rate.  And there wasn't going to be any additional charges for a last minute weekend service.  JACKPOT!  

I leave to go to my g-parents, and when I got home around 9pm (i left a check with J), there wasn't a bug in sight and all of the spray had dried.  The product that was used is safe around kids and pets, but I still wanted to make sure it was dry before Little C and I got home.  

David explained to me what the bugs were (""final cinch""), what needed to be done to insure they wouldn't come back.  We do a followup spray next week and will be scheduling regular spraying to keep our other critter problems in check - ants, crickets, and lovely summer roaches...YUCK!

I didn't eat here, but I took food to go on a lunch break. There's a rating scale ranging from mild to medium to spicy and Thai spicy. I'm not used to seeing the actual red chili flakes, but with both dishes I ordered, it looked like red confetti sprinkled over everything. Just interesting observation though - not a deal maker or breaker for that matter. Like I said, the sprinkled red chili flakes made food look like confetti-inspired fun, perhaps? 

Tom Ka soup with added shrimp - very good. I ordered this medium and the sweetness of the coconut milk really complimented the spiciness of the soup. However, the medium is not as spicy as the medium at one of my other favorite Thai places, Satara. The shrimp was cooked well - I often worry that places overcook shrimp to the point of chewy-ness, but Tom Yum's shrimp was done still tender yet cooked. 

Yellow curry with chicken. - Cooked really well. The sauce is thinner but very close to the thickness I look for in my curries. I like my curry sauces on the extra thick, rich side. (Might as go ""all out"" when going unhealthy, right?) The taste was very enjoyable and flavorful. 

I was put on hold for what seemed like 10 minutes listening to their background noise when ordering over the phone. It was around lunch time though, so I understand they were extra busy. I worried for them thinking, what if they put other people on hold this long too? I almost hung up and was going to try again another time when the girl finally picked up and was able to take my order. That was my only minor gripe. Otherwise, I definitely will return here.

I've always wanted to try Sassafraz since it is a Toronto icon known for being a celebrity hotspot when TIFF used to take place in Yorkville. 

I made the reservation on OpenTable. No one phoned to confirm the reservation beforehand. When we arrived, the hostess quickly found our reservation and asked if we were using Groupon and seated us without any problems. For the whole evening, service from the hostess to the server to the busboys were very courteous and non-intrusive.

I've read on Yelp lots of rave reviews about the ambiance -- the two story waterfall, etc -- but I found the restaurant to be just OK. I did not think the setting was particularly beautiful nor the atmosphere very romantic. I would have preferred dimmer lighting for dinner. The furnishing was modern-ish and minimalist-ish. I find it similar to the inside of Nota Bene. The dining room was large with no nooks or crannies so it did not have an intimate feel. The boyfriend found it a bit on the noisy side.

For appetizer, we had wild mushroom and marrow and chowder. I loved the mushrooms which were very tasty on a crostini. The marrow that came with the dish was ok. The mains were beef flank steak and tuna. The steak was tender and nicely cooked. Unfortunately the outer seared part of the tuna was a bit hard and lukewarm. We had chocolate cake and some kind of pineapple dessert. They tasted like standard banquet hall fare, nothing special. 

Overall I felt the quality of the food and the overall dining experience was worth the Groupon value I paid but no more. I can see myself going back to Sassafraz perhaps in the summer for a drink on the patio (just because it's so nice to relax and hang out in Yorkville on a weekend afternoon in the summer) but I would not return for dinner.

It comes with fries that were okay, but compared to the high quality of the burger, it didn't really match. Kind of reminded me of Burger King fries from the 90's.

To wash that all down, I had the chocolate shake. It was quite good, but Vincent (from the movie Pulp Fiction) would have lost his marbles on a $9 milkshake, lol. It is a normal size (16-20oz) and good for one person, so really overpriced in my opinion.

It always fast and the price for food is awesome! But if you want to go in for a quite and peaceful lunch/dinner this is not the place to go.

Pittsburgh has a lot of Thai restaurants & most of them are very good but Thai Me Up I think is the best. They always deliver; excellent food no matter what you order, reasonable prices, great service & atmosphere. 
My favorite are the wonton tacos appetizer. Delicious tilapia in fresh crispy house made taco shells with cilantro & a little bit of sriracha sauce. Amazing!! I wish they made them a little bigger as an entree. I could eat those as my whole meal. 
The vegetable spring rolls are also delicious. Crispy but not greasy & comes with a semi-sweet dipping sauce. 
I've had quite a few of the noodle & rice dishes, all are very good! My favorite entree is the pineapple fried rice with vegetables. Absolutely delicious!! Love the combination of the pineapple with the cashews. Also just the right amount of sauce, they never over do it. 
I highly recommend Thai Me Up! They won't disappoint. And make sure you try the wonton tacos!! :)",2015-04-18 20:58:47

On a busy Saturday night we were seated in the middle of the restaurant immediately. 

The server was very kind and prompt. 

When we sat the waiter placed down bread with a tomato dipping sauce. It tasted good, wasn't anything super memorable. I ordered the eggplant parmigana. It came out of the oven steaming hot. It was perfectly crisp, but not oily. The portion size was normal too - not overly large or too small. I thought the food was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.

At the time, my partner was obsessed with speakeasy's, so he really wanted to hit one up. We heard some things about this one and decided to give it a try, and boy were we impressed! Of course, the place itself is absolutely brilliant - it's hidden so that it looks just like a tailor's office, and when you walk in there's a plain-looking room that seemingly looks like... nothing. However, after a minute or two, a man in a suit comes out and invited us in! I'm not sure if we just got lucky that day or what, but it was quiet enough that we managed to get a table (though, as other reviewers have suggested, coming here with a party any bigger than 2-3 you might get turned away, as this bar is very small!)

The atmosphere of the bar was the coolest I've ever experienced; it was super dimly lit, very romantic, and had some quiet older-type music playing. The bartenders were honestly another highlight for me - ours was super friendly and outgoing, and made lovely conversation with us while we waiting for a drink. And though the drinks aren't super cheap - they were, without a doubt, the best drinks I've ever had.

After having eaten this dish at many different places over many years, I have to agree that this might be the best I've had. I've been coming here for the duck for a few years now.

These guys do it properly. They pump air into the duck for maximum crispiness of the skin and they present it at the table before slicing. Nice touch. It's served with the traditional steamed pancakes for wrapping, sliced cucumbers and green onions, and a generous amount of hoisin sauce. That's just the first course. 

The second course includes the rest of the duck meat, minced and fried up with carrots, celery, and onions. It's also served with lettuce for wrapping. A third course is available as a soup, using the bones from the duck. We decided not to go that route.

Another popular dish that we just had to order is the Szechuan Shredded Beef, crispy and sweet, with some citrus notes. A lamb stew with tofu sticks (foo jook) and sauteed snow peas tips with garlic was more than enough food for five of us. A complimentary sweet red bean soup was served for dessert.

Overall, the food is very good but the Peking (Bejing) duck is what everybody comes here for. The two-course option is around $40 and the soup option is about $5 more. I've ordered Peking duck at other restaurants and they've used a regular BBQ duck (the kind you often see hanging in the window at Chinese BBQ shops). Don't be fooled.

I had the Rice House Special (C401) which was $9.99.  It came with grilled beef, grilled pork, bean curd stuffed with shrimp paste, and a piece of Vietnamese quiche, with steamed rice, a small salad and a bowl of broth.  It was so delicious.  The portions are small, but I loved the variety.  The grilled beef is really thin, it tasted like beef jerky.  I love beef jerky so I was a happy camper, but someone expecting a thick juicy piece of meat may be disappointed.  The grilled pork was a little thicker and equally delicious.  The marinade for both meats were sweet and very flavourful.  The shrimp paste wrapped in bean curd was fried and a little oily, but still delicious.  The bean curd was crispy.  The shrimp paste tasted more of flour and fish than shrimp, but I still liked it.  The Vietnamese quiche was excellent, but I could have done without the neon orange colouring on top.  The Vietnamese quiche had the typical ground pork, vermicelli noodles, strips of cloud fungus, with an egg glaze on top.  The egg glaze had an unusual orange hue to it (food colouring, I suspect, although it could be from annatto seeds I guess).  Authentic Vietnamese quiche has real crab in it.  The one here had artificial crab.  However, for $9.99 I expected as much.  Rice was perfectly cooked.  The salad was shredded like a coleslaw with a light vinaigrette dressing.  It was mostly iceberg lettuce with a bit of carrot.  The broth was tasty albeit a bit too salty.  The dish also comes with  a side of fish sauce, but I don't like fish sauce so I told them to hold it.      

My dad had the Vermicelli Special (B301) which was also $9.99.  It came with grilled pork, nem nuong (Vietnamese meatballs - although it's shaped more like a log than a ball), chao tom (minced shrimp on a sugar cane), and a spring roll, with vermicelli noodles and the same salad that came with my dish.  My dad also loved his dish, although the portion was too small for him.  The nem nuong were not much thicker than my finger and had an artificial-looking reddish hue to it.  The chao tom also had an artificial-looking hue to it, except orangey instead of red.  He did note that it didn't taste ""shrimpy"" but rather floury.  The spring roll did not have the authentic Vietnamese spring roll wrapper (rice paper) but had the usual Chinese spring roll wrapper.  I didn't taste any of my dad's meal, so all I can comment on is the appearance and what he told me.

My mom had the Special Egg Noodle (H006) which was $8.50.  It was a bowl of egg noodles with shrimp, BBQ pork, fish balls, squid, artificial crab, bean sprouts, fried shallots and one shrimp fritter, and a side of broth.  The shrimp fritter was 1 shrimp in an egg roll like wrapper and then deep fried.  My mom liked it.  She enjoyed her meal overall.  The shrimp were a good size, and there were 2, plus another one in the fritter.  There were 2 slices of BBQ pork.  The pork was lean, not fatty.  There were 3 fish balls (each cut in half), 2 surimi crab sticks (each cut in half) and 2 pieces of squid.  

You get a free pot of tea (jasmine green tea) when you first sit down.

Service is nice and friendly.  The restaurant is clean with bamboo plants all around.  The washrooms are relatively clean as well.  

There is lots of free parking.  This restaurant is across from Vaughan Mills Mall.  So skip the food court there and head over here to eat!

I had the Original ramen and the broth was missing the warm loving feeling I expect from a bowl of beautiful steaming noodles. My friends ordered the Shoyu and Spicy Garlic, because they too felt the Original was lacking. 

I will return and try another flavour, because the restaurant is really unique with their long community sharing tables, the beautiful and very friendly servers, and the appetizers we had were quite good, Age Gyoza, Takoyaki (deep fried octopus balls), and the Hot Karaage (spicy fried chicken). The Karate was excellent and I would have tucked int a whole plate if it was on the menu.

I will also return based on my feeling towards a wonderful evening I sent at their sister restaurant in Montreal, KINKA IZAKAYA. There are a few locations in Toronto, which I need to try.

Like any respectable Ramen place they love their pigs and KINTO RAMEN pay homage to the tasty beast by posting industrial images around the restaurant. There's a big lit pig out front, one in the hall way to the toilets and one on the mirrors in the toilet.

The reason we actually chose to come here is because they were rated pretty highly on a few Vegetarian Ramen lists. They even have a specific vegetarian section on their menu with 4 different types of Veggie Ramen. 

We arrived around 7pm and were told there was a wait of about 30-40 minutes, but to check back in 20min. We decided to take a walk and come back since it was so full inside. After about 20min we were seated right away.  

We ordered :

Ramune  - sweet carbonated drink with a pretty unique bottle lid. It was super sweet and reminded me of a summer cooler. 

Asahi Draft Beer  - This was a really light beer with a great taste, it definitely paired well with the Ramen. 

Chicken Karaage Don  - A little disappointing,  there was actually so little meat on top of a full bowl of rice. It was definitely more hype than anything. 

Spicy Red Miso Ramen - really tasty and filling

Spicy Vegetarian Red Miso Ramen  - also really tasty, and a great veggie option. 

The Ramen dishes tasted great! however, I actually didn't notice too much of a difference between the Spicy Vegetarian Red Miso Ramen and the Spicy Red Miso Ramen except for the Pork. I'm not the biggest fan of pork, so I might just get the vegetarian version next time. 

The restaurant itself if in pretty close quarters, and it can get pretty loud. Also if you have asthma or are sensitive to smoke, you might want to be careful since the kitchen is pretty much an open concept, the smoke alarm went off a couple of times during our time there. 

However, everything else about this restaurant is impressively highly efficient!  The servers here are very attentive and are definitely on top of everything.  It was definitely a great first Ramen Experience. 

Pro Tips: 

If you're having trouble deciding what to order, they have a chalkboard on the wall which lists all the Ramens in order of popularity. 

The Ramen dishes are a decent size, and one person can definitely finish it on their own, but if you feel like sharing, they are so chill about it and will gladly bring you an extra bowl",2018-06-28 14:28:23

I ordered the cookies and cream version with additions of oreo and whipped cream, and it was delicious!  The rolled ice cream tastes light and airy and almost like a crepe; something about the freezing process adds either some additional coldness or flavor to the ice cream which makes it different from anything I've ever tried before.  The staff member who made our ice cream was extremely friendly and came by afterward to check and see how we were enjoying his creation.  Prices are a little high ($6.50 per cup), but the size is large enough that two post-dinner people can be somewhat healthy and share one ice cream order, which makes things more reasonable.

I'm still confused a little by the name of the restaurant, though.  Is the ice cream really fried?  I would name this place ""Frozen Cream & Bubble Tea"" personally.  ;)",2017-07-12 16:15:02

They offer an extensive menu for very reasonable prices. You can order pot pies, huge donuts, sausage rolls and of course fish and chips or fish on a bun.

I decided to try the fish and chips. For $8.00 you can't go wrong! I choose the standard haddock filets and I had my meal in no time! All meals are bagged whether you eat in or take out. They have a condiment table with utensils. I just had plain tartar sauce for my fish. Two huge fried filets sit on top of a mound of French fries! They were good but very greasy. I'm not used to greasy food but if you are then I guarantee you that you won't be disappointed. I managed to devour both pieces of fish with bits of breading and fish that came peeling off as I try to cut it.

I figured I'd just use it for finger food. Went though a ton of napkins but enjoyed it. It was the lunch hour so the place wasn't overly crowded and most people were ordering take out.

So if you are a fan of greasy food this place is for you. Believe me I did enjoy my meal. Couldn't finish it since there were so many fries. Fast service and good prices make this visit worthwhile.",2017-02-23 21:52:04

One of the few times I did not get to read Jennifer K's review first before deciding. We ordered a lot of different things to try and I must say I was happy with all the dishes.

Beef noodle soup $8.25 - flavour of soup was good, portion of meat was generous, and noodles were cooked perfectly with great chew to them. Only complaint was that the meat was a bit on the tough side but still soft enough to enjoy. 

Pork bun or I like to call them pork dumplings $5.95 (xiao long bao) - comes with 6 dumplings. Great flavours. Nice and soupy on the inside.

Noodles with spicy and peanut sauce $6.75 - looked like molten lava at first glance but it really was not that spicy. It had great flavours and the noodles were cooked to perfection once again.

Pork with preserved greens and rice $7.50 - pork was soft and tender and they got the flavours spot on with the preserved greens. I wish I didn't have to share this dish it was so good.

We got some snow pea leaves for some vegetables and as I write this review I just realized how much they charged us for it. $13.95 (HOLY F%#& SAKE's) I know these greens are normally on the pricier side and they are not in season now but WOW. They really bent us over on this one. This dish was really, really small too. This is what happens when you order and don't pay attention to the price. Anyway, another lesson learned. They did taste pretty good at least.

Finally, for dessert we got the sweet black sesame bun/dumpling $5.25 (xiao long bao) - taking a line for Guy Fieri, ""Shut the front door""! Where have these been all my life. Its basically the same outer casing as the (xiao long bao) but filled with a sweet black sesame paste. It was not liquidy or watery on the inside but more of a moist paste which was sweet. Oh man. I love these things. Comes with only 6. If I knew they were this good I would have ordered one set for myself alone.

We dined there on a Saturday night - two couples and a fifth wheel. Our reservation still showed for 4 at the restaurant, which was unfortunate. I'm chocking this up to OpenTable - and it could be why I'm seeing fewer of my favorite haunts use OT for their reservation system. Not holding that against Southern Rail.

The place was P.A.C.K.E.D.!!! Everywhere you looked - bodies. It was a very noisy place, not very good for group or intimate conversations. We often found ourselves yelling at our dinner companions. 

The decor was beautiful... along with the rustic charm were splashes of opulence and beauty - including the ginormous arrangement of flowers right behind us. It was breathtakingingly beautiful and fresh. Much as I loved looking at the arrangement, sadly, it's scent interfered with the taste and smell of my dinner. It was gorgeous - I'd hate to see the restaurant stop providing their guests with such an amazing thing of beauty - but in the end, its smell did interfere with my food experience.

Our waiter was great - quick, attentive, did a great job explaining the specials and offering suggestions. 

Where my issue is, is with the food. I just feel that it didn't measure up to its sister restaurant. It lacked the WOW factor that Beckett's Table had. I left there satiated, but not astonished - as I did with Beckett's. 

I had the chicken with biscuit dumplings. It was simply ""ok"". My husband and one of our companions both had the ribs, which were pretty good - the sauce was very obviously scratch made and had some robust, complex flavors to it - not like most bbq sauces. This stuff was high brow, for sure. The other couple tried the prix fixe menu (it was restaurant week afterall) and loved what they had - the FGTs were amazing, according to them. We all enjoyed the deserts. We all liked the food - don't get me wrong... it was simply missing that WOW that Beckett's Table has.",2015-06-10 20:48:30

Very nice and quaint location. They close after lunch and open at 5:30 for dinner. Ken was our server, him and Miguel took good care of us.
We went with a couple of friends to celebrate a birthday and had a lively conversation, but I think the meals took a long time to arrive. Our reservation was at 6pm, and our main dishes arrived around 7pm (a little past, I think)
We ordered 2 appetizers, but I think the complimentary focaccia bread and pesto would have been enough. I did like it better than the humus we ordered.
The nice touch about the humus is that it comes with slices of cucumber, radish (big white radish, not sure what is the name), and carrots, great for those with gluten intolerance or trying to keep carbs low.
I had the ribeye, no sides. I ordered it rare and the first time it was way over cooked. I brought it to the attention of our server and he immediately took it back to get me one cooked to my liking. The second one was perfect, but it took a little too long. Most of our table was done with dinner by the time I got mine (around 7:25pm). 
About that, I think that when your food order is not correct they should not take it back while they get the new one (unless, of course, it was undercooked and they need to take it to cook it longer)... it is super awkward to stay at the table with nothing to eat, well, it may be more awkward for those that did get their food... what are your thoughts on that topic?

The environment is beautiful.  Much like in churches of the time, you aren't sure where to look because there are so many beautiful features.

The menu is extremely unique with everything from run of the mill pastas to pizzas to alligator pierogies.  And the food we tried was great.  But the prices are quite high for the food you get, especially considering they are double most other brew pub restaurants in the area.

I ordered the pierogi pizza at the recommendation of several Yelpers.  I can see why it was pricey - it was HUGE.  I wish they had size options for the pizzas as this pizza could have easily served three people.  It is a good thing I loved the pizza as I'll be eating it for the next three meals.  My husband had the pasta in peanut sauce and thought it was very tasty.  Again, the portion was HUGE.    We had both ordered appetizers and would not have if we had known the food portions were so large.  

The french onion soup was fantastic but the wings were nothing to write home about.  I ordered the peanut sauce version and expected them to be tossed in the sauce.  Instead, I had plain wings with a side of the sauce delivered.  I did dip them, but tossing the wings adds to the flavor because some of it soaks in.  I'm not sure if all of their wings are served this way or just the peanut sauce ones, but it seemed strange.

We were originally hoping to try some dessert, but with the giant portions, we had no room left.

I am not sure if it is worth the $55 they charge for it or not. 

We started off with their cheese and aged meat appetizer ($16) which was delicious. Our food came a little to quickly as we were not even finished with the appetizer when the food arrived. My wife had their special. It was four seared scallops over a real meaty lobster risotto ($26). Her meal was absolutely phenomenal. My friends had the basil pasta with chicken and the crab and lobster crepe ($22). There honestly was not anything overly special with the pasta but it was good. I believe it is the cheapest thing on the menu for $16. The crepe was not visually appealing at all but made up with it with the taste. It had a good portion of crab that made it really good. I had the duck confit with fingerling potatoes and brocollini ($24). The dish was sub par. Duck should be crispy on the outside skin and moist inside. however it was the opposite. The skin was not crisp and the inside was dry. I tried to compensate the dryness with the sauce but it just didnt work well. The server was fantastic and asked what I wanted instead.

The sauce wasn't bad - it was sweet and added nice flavor to the ribs.  The ribs, on the other hand were tough.  Out of the five ribs I ate, only two were moist.  The ribs on the end were dried out, and most of the meat on all of the ribs was difficult to get off the bone.

Cheba hut isn't bad.  Its just not good.  as good as I wanted them to be.  I had excedingly high expectations for this joint, and was somewhat dissapointed once I sunk my teeth into the sub.  It lacked something...luster maybe, Im not sure, but it just didnt do it for me.

This place is okay.  It has a marijuana themed style thing going for itself.  Not so much hippie, but lots of pot references.  For starters, I dont think that the pot theme is really appropriate for children.  How do you explain this to a child?  Not a family friendly place for anyone of a youthful age (aka small children.)

My first impression: there seems to be a growing trend with waffles tasting like rubber and the taiyaki was no exception. 

One would think that after waiting 10 min for them to make it that the batter would be moist, warm, slightly crispy, and balanced nicely with the ice cream inside. Instead, it was subpar, and I was highly disappointed since it was my first time trying. It seems the other reviewers here agree with my views. 

As for the orange yuzu, I had high expectations considering the recommendations on Yelp. After trying it myself, all I can say is at least it's pretty?

The takoyaki is the saving grace of this store. It's by far one of the best I've had in Vegas (still looking for the #1 though) and I cleared the plate so quickly. The reason why I still gave a rating of 3 stars. 
Only gripe is that the takoyaki is one of the more expensive ones I've seen. Still though. Try it. Buy it. I'm sure you'd like it. 

Apart from buying more takoyaki and trying the honey toast, I don't think I'll be back very often.",2017-02-22 20:13:22

It's hard to live up to the hype, especially that PGH yelpers tend to label everything the ""Best in Pittsburgh.""  In my experience, that label has been placed on very questionable places.  This place, however, is a homerun.

For a Sunday brunch, I couldn't be happier.  The much-touted mussels were as great as advertised.  The mussels are in a brilliant and delicious broth, which you just want to drink straight up.  And the bread is a perfect fluff with a crunchy crust to soak up the juices.

The serving sizes are large -- and for around $10-14 per entree, it's head-scratching how they can make a profit.  You get a LOT of smoked salmon with your eggs benedict, you get a LOT of lamb with your Moroccan eggs, and you get a pizza sized Torte Flambe.

In addition, the service was excellent.  The food was out quickly, the waitstaff walked the tables offering coffee refills (a welcome change from having to track them down!), and they were friendly and helpful with the menu items.

It brings me back to the days where I was a carefree teenager picking up my friends in my Grand AM GT, stuffing two of them in my trunk just because we could. I loved the drive-in's then and I love them now.

Fast forward a few years to the summer of 2008 when I first moved here. I was going to culinary school thinking I was the shit and loved living the ""vegas life"". After a few months I needed something to remind me of home. I thought humm I wonder if they have drive-in's in the desert? Hot damn, they DID, and it was here that I found!!!! So I grabbed about 15 of my culinary friends, whom had never been and headed out there. We brought air mattresses to put in the back of their trucks, beer, snack, and went in our pi's, I swear I felt like I was a kid....a kid that could drink beer....but still a kid. Man I had so much fun that summer coming here and so did my friends. 

NOW in 2013 I still come here but now with my husband, I pack up a pick nick sort of meal and we have our date nights here. We are trying to be frugal with our money so this is great because it's only (drum roll please) $6.50 a person FOR TWO MOVIES!!!!! YEAH go ahead and read that again! SUCH a good price. 

I have been coming here for 5 years now and I will continue to come here. (I only have to remember to take a nap because I'm such a grandma I fall asleep during the 2nd movie.

My fiancé and I were looking for a simple cafe to grab a burger tonight - nothing fancy or pretentious.  We got exactly what we were looking for at Badger Cafe.

The made-to-order burgers are fan-freaking-tastic.  I don't really care for burgers all that much, and I'm rarely in a burger mood.  However, I love the burgers at Badger Cafe.  I was surprised at how un-greasy mine was - it tasted really fresh, and the bun was delicious and flaky.  The grilled onions were amazing.... reminded me of eating White Castle during my adolescence (I'm from Missouri).

We also got an order of the wings.  They are on the small side, but I really like that - sometimes the big wings are gristly and tough.  The skin was flaky and amazing.  I would come back just for the wings sometime, but next time I'll get a hotter sauce.  The medium isn't hot at all.

Best of all, the service was friendly.  It was the kind of place ""where everybody knows your name"" (*cue Cheers theme song*).  My fiancé and I spent a good chunk of time reminiscing about our first date, which was in a diner not too different from the Badger Cafe (awwwww).  The place just felt home-y like that.  

Highly recommended.  It kinda looks like a dive, but give it a try.

**EDIT:  Holy mother of hot wings.  Their wings are crazy good.  They're small and crispy, but the sauces are delicious.  We always get a mix of BBQ and their hottest hot wings (which are the perfect level of heat - doesn't burn your face off, but stings a little bit).

My boyfriend and I have lived in Old Town for 2 years and had yet to find a decent delivery chinese place.  I'd actually ordered from Yummy Yummy over a year ago and was not impressed.  But, either it's hit or miss, or their ""new management"" actually has improved things.

I tend to order a lot of fried, filled foods when I order chinese, and this place did it right!  I had crab rangoon, pork filled wontons, and an eggroll, and all were fantastic!  The eggroll was gigantic and very crisp, and the rangoon and wontons were crisp with a good amount of filling.  Usually when I order these things, the rangoon is soft and mushy, and the wontons are mostly breading.  So, I was excited that this was not the case.  

My sesame chicken tasted like every other order of sesame chicken I've ever had.  I was not a fan of the fried rice that accompanied it.  It tasted kind of like I would expect feet to taste.  My boyfriend had chicken chow mein and orange chicken with the sauce on the side, and he was a fan of both.

I kept trying to find Drip Coffee Lounge for ages and would somehow end up by the ballpark, completely befuddled, until finally noticing it this morning, realizing it was just on the other side of Trente-Cinq from the Lisa G Wine Bar, where I was last night. Go figure.

Nice, hip, modern interior (plus menus on the tables in the form of DVD cases) and really friendly barristas. My 16 oz double soy latte was $4.95 (ouch) but I will say it's the best made double soy latte I've had in a long, long time. I then sat on the couch and browsed through the New York Times on the coffee table.

I'd say it's got a real pleasant, agreeable atmosphere to relax on a weekend morning. I didn't have any food, but another customer who had gotten  a sandwich ($6) to go came back in with her box to ask why there was only a half sandwich and a bunch of chips in her box. ""We have small portions"" was the response. The customer then left a little bewildered as she kept saying, ""I'm just really surprised.""

So take that incident for whatever it is. Don't know how often I'll be spending $5 for two shots of espresso and steamed soy milk (which, in all essence, means I should just stay home and make my own damn coffee, but then that would get real old real fast), but my own personal experience here was a good one.

It did not hurt at all, she has the touch of an angel while waxing and tweezing. She was quick, efficient, talked just enough but did not overdo it. Her station was clean, and she was very pleasant and informed me of every step. 

I have gotten so many compliments on my brows. I will for sure continue coming back, it is so nice to not have to stress about how my brows look. I love having someone that I can trust help me out and make them look better than I have ever been able to master. 

The 4-star is just because the friendliness of front desk staff could be better. One girl was very sweet and pleasant, but the other was not exactly thrilled to be there.

However, if you have any standards for sushi, this place falls short.  I got the dynamite roll and the spicy salmon skin roll.  The pickled ginger was missing and the rolls are smallish.  Not huge but not small...so the proportions of rice to filling is good.  ie not too much rice. 
The dynamite roll was lacking...it only had 2 things in the roll! - the tempura shrimp and avocado and that was it!!!!  The spicy salmon wasn't much different had the salmon skin and a bit of cucumber.   So that's what you get for the cheapo lunch.

We got the mac n cheese with the ham add-on and the redneck grilled cheese. I am not a mac n cheese person, but the bf who is, loved his lunch. I was really taken aback by the ham on his plate. It wasn't the over-processed ham (sorry, not a ham person!) that you get stateside. It was like pulled pork, but ham-ified! The flavor of ham, but none of the spongy texture. The bread on my grilled cheese was to die for! I even requested, and received, the recipe! I will have to try it! The pulled bbq pork in the grilled cheese is a bit on the sweet side on its own, but it's perfect with the saltiness of the cheese, against the backdrop of the bread. The portions are huge as well. We both had leftovers, that we happily devoured for dinner.

Even though we were stuffed, just could not turn down the mango cheesecake. It was light cheesecake in a small mason jar, with mango coulis on top.

My fellow yelper and I checked this place out this afternoon and aside from the few uncalled for comments by people passing by, it was a nice afternoon..

The celery is crunchy...this is a big thing for me, soggy celery an automatic 2 stars! Only problem is that it wasn't enough and was served way before the wings. The dill dip served with it was delicious. 

My friend and I shared a 20-wing dish, going the ""mild"" route of honey garlic and BBQ. The wings are definitely covered in your chosen sauce and there is a fair amount of meat on each wing. So it's very clear, they know what they are doing in the wing department.

I ordered a side of wedges and they were good as well. Perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

So why not five stars? I suppose that's the non-wing girl taking off that one star. I'd love to have had the option of boneless wings with the same choice of sauces.

We usually sit in the backroom bar area as it's not as stuffy & crazy as the main bar/restaurant area. During our first few visits we were impressed with the service and food. The servers were really friendly and attentive and the food was really good. I've tried the fish tacos, steak and my favorite~ the raw oysters (not sure how or why but they seem fresher than some I've had at expensive steakhouses). The pizza is pretty good too. There are lots of other items I'd love to try as they have a very extensive menu~ certainly not your typical bar-food fare. 

Of late though, even though we get to Miller's early on fight nights to get a good seat, the service has been very disappointing & I've had to repeatedly flag a server down even though it's still early in the evening and the bar area isn't busy. Several times we've felt like we were in a ""black hole"" as servers would pass us by, ignore us or tell us they would send someone over. And just this past weekend, once we arrived, we were told that the entire back bar area had been reserved for a private party so in order to watch the UFC Fight we'd have to sit in the main restaurant area which was already packed with people watching other sporting events. Needless to say we opted to go home and watch the fight on pay-per-view.

Classic Italian values their food and quality of their product. Case in point. I ordered an Italian Sausage pizza for pickup. I arrived to pick up the pizza and the guy handling the pizza tells me that it will be a few extra minutes. He had to redo my pizza since it wasn't perfect. There was too much burned crust on the bottom. Nothing worse than a pizza charred on the bottom. I'm glad he took the extra time to make my pizza right.

Upon getting home, the pizza was great. The pizza is thin and covered generously with your toppings. The sausage on the pizza was really tasty. 

Pizzas are between $10-15. Each pizza is 8 slices. 

There is a small patio outside to enjoy pizza with heaters (if needed).

I want to say they did a great job with selecting their entertainment (Mclean Avenue Band with a killer fiddler who looks like he isn't old enough to be in a pub AND a full pipe band).

I've actually been here a few times, all for special occasions. I remember when I first went and I thought it would be a really fancy place however, its a mixed crowd with mostly families on long weekends. So don't worry about under dressing! 
Originally, I made a reservation for 8 PM (the day of) but my family got hungry and we were already downtown around 5 PM. Wanting to save the day, I called the restaurant and the person who picked up was very helpful. It was 5:20 PM and I asked if they were accepting walk-ins and for how much longer. She told me that they would be for another 30 minutes.
Ran to the restaurant ahead of my family and managed to get a table for 5 just before the cut-off. A man named Carlos was our server and he was wonderful and very considerate of Chinese dining and culture. The main reason we came to 360 was for my grandfather to get a view of the city (touristy) and to experience European-styled dining. Although the menu was very limited and didn't suit my grandfather's liking, he tried his best to make substitutions and make us feel welcomed. 
We brought individual plates to our table and aligned our entrees down the middle so we could all share. Here's a list of what we've ordered:
Appetizers - mushroom chowder (really didn't like it. It had a vinegary base), Niagara charcuterie (not bad)
Entrees - maple tarragon brined supreme of chicken (it was well cooked and not dry), Quebec pork tenderloin (a bit dry but we got well done), Niagara Pancetta wrapped fogo island cod (my grandfather enjoyed this), Atlantic Salmon (ok), and Barley and almond gnocchi (crispy-ish).
Desserts - apricot frangipane tart (this was good), warm caramel apple crisp (it looked like there was cotton candy on top?), lemon raspberry verrine (love the sweet and sour combination)

Once again, Carlos was very informative and told us we could do 5 entrees with 2 appetizers and 3 dessert, which would come to a total of five 2 courses.

Anyway, we had the pot roast nachos for an app, and they ruled. Combined with a salad for each, and a dessert to share, this was big enough to feed two. My Pork filet gorgonzola was as beautiful as it was delish. they're 3 medallions wrapped in bacon, topped with cheese, bbq sauce, and placed onto potato pancakes. dessert was a ""chef's whim"" in the chocolate mousse crepes that darren and I shared. awesome! the service was tops too!",2013-10-26 17:54:12

we had a waiter serve us right away and I thought he was just excellent, he was telling us about his Turkish background and explained to us which dishes he recommended the most based on what we said we liked.

We were started with the bread and hummus, the bread was so incredibly soft and fresh, I almost over indulged in it because of this.

Moving along to the eggplant dish (with the white/red sauce on top) I wasn't really a fan since i don't like eggplant but my friend enjoyed this a lot more than i did.  

Moving along to the mains, my lamb was cooked perfectly, and tasted amazing, it was soft, and flavourful - this dish alone will make me return to this place.

My friends veggie platter - they weren't impressed with it, they thought for a main it would have more food, and found the rolls to be a little bland. Thankfully they filled up on the eggplant otherwise they would have been more hangry!

I stopped in after work for a pedi and gel manicure.  The owner, Elan, greeted me as I walked in and told me the wait would be 30 minutes or I could return at 6 PM.  So, I opt to return at 6:00.  I waited another 15 mins before she started to soak my nails, but that's been forgiven (read on). 

My pedi was fine, no complaints whatsoever.  Although I did pick a bad polish and asked to have something different and that was handled, no problem! 

I am a customer who isn't real picky about color (in fact if my daughter is with me, she usually picks matching colors for both of us -- usually blue or green, so again, not picky at all!).  I have an idea of bright or not, glittery or not, but I let the tech suggest things and if I see a color I like on someone else, I might ask for that as well.  So, Elan's nails were gorgeous (two-tone sparkly gold n gray creation), I had to have them!  She said, ""no problem, we do it for you too!""  She explained it to Jackie and lo and behold, I have the most beautiful pink n silver, half n half, gel nails ever!  I love them and Jackie painted, glittered, and painted again -- ever so perfectly!!

Side note:  Jackie (Elan's daughter) had previously done my nails a few times in another salon and I was so grateful and happy to find her here at Elan!  I loved her before and love her even more after this visit. She is sweet, kind and extremely diligent and detailed!  The salon has been open since December and they have been doing very well - it's no mystery, they care about their clients and are great at what they do, plus their prices are wonderful!!  $57 for a pedi and gel mani w/glitters ~ I LOVE it!",2012-07-20 21:53:42

I typically wait until more than one experience before writing a review, but honestly I am pretty convinced I won't be back. Unless it's an invite where the other party insists, because I won't be spending my $$ here. 
The reason there are 3 stars instead of 2, SERVICE. I can not blame the friendly hostess nor the attentive server for the lack in flavor. So by all means, credit is due in the hospitality department. 
I was in during a busy work week lunch hour. I was very happy to be seated at a booth instead of a table, even though I was dining alone. 
I ordered the fish tacos with dirty rice instead of fries. (small upcharge)
I also started with a cup of clam chowder. The soup was decent. FULL of clams, like almost overwhelming. However it would have really hit the spot had the consistency been a bit thicker. 
Still ate it all, so I approve. 
Now the tacos, probably the worst fish tacos I have ever had. Not what I expect from a place known as the ""seafood house"" Double tortillas as usual, but they were soggy. Like soggy and stuck together from either sitting under a heat lamp or even being re-heated. Same thing with the fish inside. You could tell at one point in time, it was a crispy filet. Now it was just moist and not appetizing at all. But where was the moisture coming from? I didn't seem to have this sauce that I read about in other reviews. Just cabbage, and a very very small side of avocado. I ate the avocado alone, it tasted better that way. I tried to eat only the fish out of the taco, but I couldn't do it. Flat out gross. 
To top it off, the dirty rice was at least 2-3 days old. Mushy like it had been in a rice cooker overnight. The flavor would have been ok had it been fresh. I could have put all the rice in a big ball and it would have stuck together easily. The 16 year old me would have thrown it back in the kitchen, but it just sadly sat on the plate. Untouched.

The Porch is so close to campus that it is just and easy choice. I have been there a few times and I believe that they are a consistent a-ok. 

I ordered for a starter the PUB FRIES ($6) Roasted Chicken Cream Sauce, Pennland Mozzarella Curd & Rooftop Herbs.

I would say that it was light on the mozzarella curds, and the curds looked more like sprinkle mozzarella. The chicken cream sauce was also brown. I don't know if that is what a cream sauce is supposed to look like, but I was thinking it would be more white than gravy. The fries were fried to perfection and super crisp. They were really good. I don't know if I would order them again but they were good enough to try for sure. 

I then picked my main entree. ""THE PORCH"" PRIME RIB SANDWICH* ($15)
Roasted Peppers, Pickled Red Onions, Arugula, Pennland Cheddar, Herb Aioli on Farm Bread.

This used to be my main go to whenever I came to The Porch. I know that they changed it and I just don't know if it is really me anymore. I tried it again last night and I think I will have to change my order. The picked red onions were fantastic and the roasted peppers are a good and new addition. I just don't know what it is the sandwich leave me going, ""eh"". I just am not as excited about it as I usually am. I think that maybe I have ordered it too many times and am bored with it. The flavor was on point, it really was. But I just was not into it yesterday.

They have a new pizza on the menu, POTATO & LEEK ($12)

Fried calamari and clams - good but I hate to say but Legal Seafood on the East coast does it better and they're a chain.  Having said that since we don't have a Legal Seafoods here, I would order this again.

Pan seared scallops in vanilla scented cauliflower purée - wonderful and not too sweet.  I was in the mood for scallops and this really satisfied.

Brown paper bag baked apple pie - great presentation and very good pie serve a la mode with vanilla ice cream.

Highlights - honey butter with black salt, great combo of sweet and salty. Defined the name, Honey Salt, and was excellent on served with the bread basket.

I enjoy that it plays alternative films that aren't usually shown at the bigger chain theaters around town.  It supports events like the Calgary International Film Festival and the Underground Film Festival.  It's a little old and run down, but it is able to pull it off in a positive, nostalgic kind of way.

The Plaza is also available to be rented out for private events.  A friend of ours took advantage of this for his wife's 30th birthday.  He arranged to have her favorite film played and somehow managed to keep it a secret that it was a private event that all of her friends & family were invited to.  She was quite surprised when she walked into the theater to find it filled with people she knew!!  

It was definitely one of the better surprise parties I've been to.  In addition to showing her favorite movie, her husband had gotten her family from the east coast to record a ""Happy Birthday"" message.  He edited a bunch of pictures and these videos together to create an intro film that they showed before the movie.  After the show, everyone stuck around for brithday cake and socialization in the lobby.  It was a lot of fun, and a unique idea for a party.

This place opened up about an year ago and has been busy. Your lucky if you get seated right away. There always seems to be a line up and a long wait.

The food is decent, better than most of the pubs around here. I've been here a couple of times so I've ventured the menu a bit. I've had the burger, which again was decent but nothing to rave over. The fish and chips are also just decent. The nachos.. you get the point. Everything pretty much decent. They have various types of beer here and they keep it interesting.

The service is tardy and there are times when you're trying to get the wait staff's attention for a long period of time.

Service : the service is quick in the first 5 minutes..the staff would barely give us a chance to decide what to order staff came by our table and asked 4 times in less than 5 minutes.  By the time we were ready to order, then their attention wavered, took us another 5 minutes just to flag someone over.  Self serve on your beverages (water/hot water/tea)

Food : we ordered the shrimp wonton lo mein and the dumpling lo mein.  In future, we'll likely order the noodle soup version of those 2 dishes..since they basically charged an extra dollar for the use of the bowl to have the soup on the side.  $7 for the lo mein version, $6 for the noodle soup version.  The soup broth was simple, lightly seasoned and decent amount of scallions.  For us tho, not enough noodles, almost considered ordering a 2nd dish of lo mein or shrimp wonton noodle soup (btw $2 extra if you want extra noodles).  Impressed with the size of the dumplings and the shrimp wontons.  We found the shrimp wontons and the dumplings to be to our liking, plump and juicy shrimps.

Food for thought : would return for future visits if looking for a quick bowl of noodle soup.  Not likely to hit up this place if we were super super hungry.  Even after my wife and I were done our lo mein dishes we were still hungry for more.  Similar concept resto to Jim Chai Kee, similar size wontons. Not sure why tip is needed honestly..other than serving the food order..they don't do anything else for the customer..beverages are self-serve.

Kudos to the actors, I would eff that up and have a hard time being in character all the time specially I imagine some people try to troll on them. There's also a integrated guide helping you through. I think they were thoughtful about the ""experience"" part. 

I do enjoy that there's a balance of explaining what each mobster ran and did, but also had artifacts and stories about their life outside of scheming. They are normal people, too. I particularly enjoyed reading peoples private letters. 

There is a lot of reading to do and I know some people don't like to read or don't have much of an attention span so this isn't the place to bring them to.... or maybe it is since reading is fundamental! I think certain segments would have been good to connect by a narration or some sort of demonstration. If you don't know much about the mob and missed a few slides you might not get how Mobster A played a part in mobster D's life. It can get confusing trying to remember the details and putting the relations together since it's a bit of information overload.  I also wish there was more revealed about the mobster workings- I learned more about this in 5 minutes of googling than I did in the exhibit. If mob is about tha business then I want to know all about the inner workings. 

I like there's a video about the Godfather film. Since it just plays on a reel though I did not watch it as I hate watching something from the middle.  

I like to think some of the most interesting mob  facts today were stories Yelper Elnino F. and I were exchanging of people we know who were involved in Vegas mob business. 

 I worry about places like these though. I get they're giving the ""tourist pricing"" and they have to pay actors and upkeep technology, but $40 is enough to turn a lot of people off even if you're interested in the subject. Sometimes pricing lower and pushing out the attraction as a fun and affordable experience is better than trying to reap every possible dollar from each sucker. Suckers tell friends then not to come for $40 and don't buy the overpriced $20+ pictures. I like what one museum I've been to does- you pay a little fee and they email it to you to print as you please. Many people were doing it because it's the price of a photobooth and not a photoshoot. 

Overall the exhibit was interesting, but not $40 worth. I would recommend this to people who are interested in the mob, but if you can find a discount . Can't be too upset- it was free through HouseSeats.",2011-07-03 09:53:03

I would come back just based on the atmosphere alone. I cant wait to come hang out n try some of the other things on the menu this summer.

I wasn't in love with my panini and neither was my mom so I will probably steer clear of those in the future and just stick to regular sandwiches, soups and salads.

My mushroom bisque was delightful. Creamy and rich with the right amount of mushrooms. I would come back just for soup when I'm in the mood again.

The only thing I didn't care for was the restaurant layout. All the chairs ere huddled so closely together it made it pretty difficult for people to navigate around the restaurant since there was no clear path to the ordering line, trash or drink station. Everyone kept bumping into one another and it became quite irksome. Since they just recently opened I'm sure these are small tweaks that can be made to improve as they learn. 

The staff is all very new as well and it was slightly more difficult to order than it should've been given the fact that I had to repeat my order three separate times as I moved down the line. Might be a little easier if I could just say it once and someone could write it down. Not too hard for ordering one item but when I was trying to remember what everyone in my party wanted every time I had to repeat the entire order it became harder to recall with each subsequent interaction. 

Otherwise a decent quick eat spot for bites on the go.",2015-12-23 14:50:16

As a vegetarian when my grandmother suggested it I was expecting no choices, but after a quick glance at the online menu I saw they didn't forget the veggies!  Now the one vegetarian item on there dinner menu is a selection of 4 side dishes but that was more then enough for me.  I had the house salad (others are not vegetarian), a baked potato, veggies, and I ordered the fries as well for my son.  The veggies were surprisingly delicious I expected microwaved and covered in butter, not the case. They were yummy, the potato was good, not exceptional but I prefer Yukon golds to russets (just a personal preference). We also had the Baby Bloom to start and it was so yummy, the crust is light almost like a tempera batter then anything.  Very yummy.  Also the best part of your meal is free, don't miss out on the rolls!

Also I want to mention service was fantastic. My only issue was the pajama shorts our hostesses wore, but I think it was a 4th of July thing because they all wore red white and blue.  Not a huge issue just found it odd.

My toddler daughter and I met 3 friends there around 6:15pm.  It was not too packed, and they immediately had a high chair waiting for our table.  The 4 of us ordered 4 appetizers (the squash ravioli, the carpacchio, the artichoke heart risotto, and the fried gnocchi), and every single one of them was truly great.  (If I want to get really specific, I will say that the fried gnocchi was a little bland, but gnocchi is bland on its own anyway, so I wasn't expecting otherwise.  Also, I will say that I have had better carpacchio... not in terms of quality, but in terms of presentation and flavor.)  Even my daughter loved all 4 appetizers!

For dinner I couldn't decide between the pasta with clams and the capellini (angel hair with tomato and basil), so Joshua (BEST SERVER!!), suggested he would split the entree in half for me so that I could try both... which was totally awesome.  Both entrees were so good!  I have to mention here that the pasta with clams is the best I have ever had-- it was NOT in a cream sauce or a red sauce.  Instead, it was in a light herb/oil sauce with fresh garlic cloves... perfect!

My friends got the veal and the chicken marsala, which were also truly wonderful.  Total bill for the 4 of us with 4 appetizers, 3 entrees, soft drinks, and 4 alcoholic drinks was $99.  Great!

For service, vibe, and food quality, you really can't go wrong with this place.  I am so excited to finally find a great Italian restaurant-- that doesn't cost a million dollars-- right by Old Town Scottsdale. :)",2011-08-03 19:21:00

I was not in the mood for beans so I selected, cilantro rice, tender juicy beef, green peppers and onions, cheese, pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole and lettuce. This burrito was fat even without the beans!

The first thing that comes to mind after the first bite is FRESH! The food is not greasy, every ingredient taste fresh and of good quality!

I also chose a side of guacamole and chips! Mmmmm yum I love their guacamole and fresh fried corn chips so much!

These are, to me the freshest, quite unique sandwiches. And NO, I don't know the owners or have any connection to the place other than going there and never having a problem.

There are only 2 or 3 tables on their ""patio"" (i.e. on the sidewalk) so we were stuck inside on this beautiful summer evening.  The inside, however, is beautiful.  Super tall ceilings, industrial design, reasonably spaced tables despite how narrow the space is.  I especially liked the chairs (they look like the Remy chair from Restoration Hardware), but some patrons found them uncomfortable.  They have different chairs in different sections of the restaurant, which I thought was creative and interesting.

If you're doing Summerlicious, it's imperative to peruse the menu before deciding on your destination.  I was sold on Quince the minute I read: Octopus Carpaccio, as an appetizer.  I was even able to overlook the fact that it was served with capers (on my questionably short list of ""dislikes"").  I never even knew this dish existed.  It was even better than I expected and impressed that it was an option, considering some of the other options were as mundane as soup or salad.

Choosing from the list of entrées was a challenge for me.  I usually prefer the shortened Summerlicious menus because I struggle with meal selection, but Quince offered 5 delicious options.  I'm used to a Summerlicious menu only offering 2 or 3 choices, and even then one of them is easily disqualified.  I was especially interested in the braised pork shoulder, grilled salmon or pappardelle with veal ragu.  However, the chicken or gnocchi options also seemed like good choices.  I went with the pork shoulder and my date decided on the salmon.  The portion was rather large, especially considering this was for Summerlicious.  I found the whole dish on the salty side, but the meat was so tender it fell apart any time I touched it.  I stole a bite of the salmon when my date wasn't looking, and it was also cooked to perfection.  The aioli sauce was a nice complement to the fish.  I was impressed.

And to top it all off, the $25 meal includes a dessert.  This was a no-brainer for me; the obvious choice is the lemon meringue pot au crème with blueberry compote.  My date chose the chocolate walnut brownie, based on the waitress' recommendation.  The lemon meringue was a winner!

The high rating is mostly due to the value.  For $25 the quality and quantity of the food was outstanding.  The service was very friendly, but not necessarily attentive.  They forgot to give us bread when every other table around us already had their basket and, for some reason, our meals took a while, with no explanation.

However, having said that, the restaurant itself it is extremely purely run.  The service seems to be in a hurry (even when there are not many people really in the place).  The menu has different details from what the chef is preparing (e.g., one item we order was supposed to come with potato salad based on the menu but it came with fries).  We also heard people at the nearby tables complaining about their orders being mixed up.  

With respect to the food it is nothing spectacular, but it is not bad as well.  I would definitely like to try more things on their menu.

After reading rave reviews about the poutine, I had to try it, and ordered a poutine appetizer followed by the vegetarian souvlaki. Portions are huge and the food was indeed delicious - the poutine lived up to its reputation and my ""souvlaki"" was moist, tender, and well-seasoned.

Our server was a bit abrupt, which was a little unnerving, but she got the job done.

I had such high hopes for DT Summerlin, and thought it would be laid out more like The Grove or Century City in LA, with pretty outdoor walkways, places to sit in the SHADE, and new and interesting shops or stalls. NOPE. The center driveway is for cars much like the District in GV now is, and there are no covered awnings or benches (which are made out of metal btw- LOL), so summer shopping should be a blast when it's 110 degrees. It actually had more of a vibe of an outlet mall, very sparse and dry. The two department stores, Dillard's and Macy's are on the far end of the largest parking lot, and Macy's looks like an old dilapidated department store, not one that just opened. 

The walkways in between the stores are interesting, it's almost like the mall is cut in half and you have to go down an alley to get to the other side of the shops to see what you might have missed. The only restaurant open when I was there was Crave, which had a 2 hour wait, but other than that I think the only two additions will be CPK and Wolfgang Puck. The Nordstrom Rack, ULTA, Trader Joes etc. is on the OPPOSITE side, which is both good and bad. If someone just wants to go grocery shopping and run into NR, they can pull into that lot and not make a mess of navigating the mall, but if you are out shopping for the day, you'd have to move your car.

It was my first time indoor rock climbing so I was quite weary about it at first. We entered and paid the weekend rate which ended up being $22/person (cheaper than its competitor) including equipment and shoes. We got geared up and was given a lesson on climbing and belaying by our super friendly instructor. Climbing up my first wall with my husband belaying me, I didn't want to sit back or let go of the wall with fear of falling but the guy working, Bryan or Ryan, made me feel comfortable enough to trust the rope tied around my husband's waist, and sit back 30 feet up in the air. 

It was all smooth sailing after that. My husband and I took turns climbing a bunch of walls for almost 2 hours, and by the end of the night, I couldn't climb one more wall because my arms had no strength left in them. My husband played around with bouldering because he's strong enough, but that wall with the little concave in it killed us both. When I went to the bathroom to wash my hands, I had the weirdest sensation of not being able to close my hands completely without effort. I suppose that means I got a good work out! 

I'm so glad we found this place to work out before we shove our faces with AYCE sushi from Blue Fin.

I had French toast, bacon, as well as a taste or two of Eggs Benedict.  The French toast had bananas and blueberries with it and was quite delicious.

Here's why I give The Ace five stars....

1. Everything about the brunch was generous. The French toast was a large portion. Other plates I observed were full of generous portions, whether they had salad, fruit, eggs, or whatever. The bacon side had plenty of bacon.
2. The coffee was befitting of a great breakfast place.
3. The menu had lots of options. If you like anything at breakfast, you will find it here.
4. The service was hospitable. So often, really cool looking places (Ace has a nice cozy vibe) have employees who are very cool as well, in fact, too cool to give you any decent service.  Not here. The service was really first rate. I never had to ask for a coffee refill or a kind smile.

Unfortunately, after living in the city for a few years and trying a lot of wonderful food that this city has to offer, we returned for a visit and I was less than impressed. 

Previously their burgers came sans fries and there were a few different fries that were offered. We tried truffle fries (I think...) and I was excited to try them again when we returned last night! Unfortunately now the fries come on the side of your burger, and they don't offer anything other than regular, sweet potato and onion rings (which are just some lamely pedestrian offerings for a burger place on the strip). I tried the regular fries with my burger and was pretty unimpressed. In my opinion, if you are serving 15$ burgers you better be offering some pretty amazing fries to go with them. Sadly, this was not the case.

I tried the Nom Nom burger and it was really good. The meat was actually cooked the medium rare that I asked for, which I always appreciate. The cheddar was good, the 1000 island was a nice flavor, and the chips were fantastic. I would have much rather preferred a side of the chips (which tasted like they may have been made in house?) rather than the fries that I got with my burger! The burger was huge, while the portion of fries wasn't insane, the size of the burger was! I couldn't even finish half of the burger. 

If you check in and order a burger they give you a free 12 oz of their house lager, which wasn't spectacular, but it's always nice to get something free for a yelp check in! It looked like they had a few rotating taps with craft brews, and they had a nice selection of bottled beer to offer! I really liked looking at their hard cider offerings, they even had a few that I hadn't tried before!

The service was very good, and it was incredibly fast. It was almost too fast, we probably could have sat and chatted a bit more. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, though.

The only reason I would be back would be to try one of their boozy shake flavors - they looked very interesting, and I'm bummed that I was too full to try one!",2015-11-21 18:12:54

The only other Afghan restaurant I've tried is Bamiyan Kabob. This place was pretty similar. Upon arrival you're greeted with 2 huge fountains and pretty lighting fixtures. My son loved them. The restaurant is huge and decorated nicely. Lots of spacing. We visited on a Sunday afternoon and it got really busy after we ordered. Lots of families!

The ordering is also similar to Bamiyan, where you place your order at the cashier and then they'll announce when your order is ready over a microphone.

The wait was a bit long, but the food made up for it. Our chicken combo came with salad, rice, and naan with hot sauce and a white yogurt-like sauce. Rice was great, naan was warm, salad came with cucumbers and sliced tomato, and the chicken kabob was delicious. The chicken kofta was also good, but kabob stood out more.

There are only a few places I've eaten at because I've had issues with gristly meat at several. It makes me leery to try new places. I ordered the lunch special ($5) which was chicken Kung Pao. It comes with egg ribbon soup, spring roll, and a crab puff. I usually only have one sip of the soup because it's flavorless at most places. This one had chicken broth that tasted just like my Grammy's chicken broth. You could tell it didn't come from bouillon. I ate almost the whole thing and would've but I was too full by the end. The other thing I liked tremendously was the spring roll. Again, not something I usually care for but this one had the lightest, crispiest crust. It tasted so fresh and light. I've never had better. The crab puff was as expected, all cream cheese, no crab. The only ones I've ever had that actually have crab are the ones from Pei Wei (like I said, I only eat at a few places regularly and this is one). The Kung Pao was also good but I've never had it before so not sure how it compares to other places. What stood out is that the chicken was very tender and there were actual vegetables! So many Chinese places skimp on the veggies. I liked the large chunks of celery, zucchini and bell pepper. I also ordered a yummy ice tea which tasted fresh and home made.

I think the best thing about Noda right now is their patio. They have been making solid improvements ever since moving in. They have so much room to sit!

Interior is really nice (modern, hipster) and with a dark (yet warm) lightning. They do have large seatings, but it's usually packed during lunch/dinner hours. Good thing they open till 2am for any late night smackers. Service is also good, waitress tries to be as informative and well mannered as they can while under a hectic, busy environment. 

Tried lunch and dinner here. They have a lunch menu so it's a bit more convenient and worthy of the price. 

Lunch sets include standard Taiwanese sausage rice or minced meat rice or black pepper sauce pork chop rice. It's a good fusion and comfort food feeling of Taiwanese and Japanese style cuisine. And price worthy for an included bubble tea!

Dinner specials include their Japanese theme hot pot (mixed with some Taiwanese style food) or stone pot rice. The hot pot is good for sharing and enough to feed 2 people. I enjoyed the sukiyaki and the milk cheese (the best).

I love the public art in this casino.  Check out the second floor between the ice cream shop and the buffet.  They have some great art on the walls.  Plus, they have holes in the floor left of the buffet (across the hall from Jean Georges, American Fish, and Sirio) where you can look down to the first floor.  It's a pretty interesting design.

Something I discovered on my last visit - this is an occupancy based property.  Which means that if the occupancy is low, they start temporarily closing restaurants.  Because it does not front the street, not many people walk in from the street apparently.  We went when NFR and the marathon were in town and four restaurants were closed!

It was a Saturday night around 6:15 with several tables set and empty at the restaurant. A group of two walked in directly in front of our group of three. We were all generally greeted within about  30 seconds - great!

The group of two was seated within about a minute while our group continued to stand at the entrance...waiting to be sat. Several servers and what appeared to be hosts continued to walk by us. After an additional five minutes of no one greeting us, asking if we've been helped or any other dialogue, we left. 

This was truly sad as I'd just explained to my group before arriving at the restaurant how nice the place is and how friendly the staff had been.

The pizza was pretty solid, but the service was lacking a little bit.
I showed up earlier than the rest of my party on Thursday for lunch so I sat at the bar and drank an ice cold glass of water after a morning round of golf. I heard a manager talking, saying he was ""giving this table of first-timers a comped order of canolis"" 
When we were seated we went outside, and it was beautiful out so that was great. The hostess offered ""iced tea, water, or maybe a Peroni"" She didn't ask us if it was our first time, offer to describe the menu and their prices or try to upsell anything like an appetizer or garlic bread or salads. We decided to split a large and the ladies in the group were gonna split a small pizza, and the small is still plenty to share. The girls also decided to split a small caesar salad. We ordered and everything went normal. The pizza took a little longer than I anticipated being a very thin crust and the very beginning of lunch hour, but came out nicely proportioned with plenty of meatballs and onions on one, and plenty of ricotta cheese and pepperonis on the other. The pepperoni was nice and spicy, and the meatballs are full of flavor and nice and large too.
When it came time to ask if everything was going well, clear the plates, get us our checks and get the hell out of there is where the service lacked. Our server disappeared for a good 10-12 minutes when we were done eating and it took a long time to get the check and clear the credit card back to us to sign.  One of the other things that bugs me about Grimaldis is that each topping is at least $2-4 and the personal cheese pizza starts at $10 and the large at $18. If you get a large with 2 toppings you're already looking at $24+ just for a pizza. Add two drinks and a salad and you're looking at $45 with a tip for a lunch.

Also, what kinda place doesn't serve ranch? We asked for a side of ranch to dip the crust in when the pizza came and she said they don't even serve it at this restaurant. With salad on the menu how do you not serve ranch? This is America right? We love our ranch dressing.

It's not like we were stealing from them or anything.  If they can't support yelpers or make them feel welcome like other places they should leave yelp deals and/or close down if they can't be nice or/friendly to yelpers, it was just rude and killed my groups mood.

There are just so many wonderful products at Trader Joes that are or way better or cheaper than at other stores, and many staples that I can't even find anywhere else. My favorites: the best soy creamer ($1.50), kimchi fried rice (especially good with toasted seaweed), edamame hummus (the best hummus ever), delicious $10 moscato dessert wine, refrigerated roasted beets, vanilla soy ice cream, and the list could go on and on...

My ONLY gripe? The store is almost always crowded (and rightly so - great products at awesome prices), so they really, really, for the love of God, REALLY need to get rid of those kid-sized shopping carts. Yes, I am sure it is super cute to parents (but no one else) to have children pushing tiny carts around, but I swear, I am going to lose it the next time I get scraped in the shins by one of these!! 

I actually do love children, but these shopping carts are just the worst. The worst!  If the store weren't so crowded and the aisles weren't so congested, it would be a different story. 

The staff there are the most helpful, cheerful people I've ever met in a grocery store setting! One girl in particular (I don't actually know her name...) with glasses is the sweetest person ever, who has helped me discover lots of new favorites that I probably wouldn't have tried otherwise. Also, she explained to me that they have a pretty good return policy. I, for one, couldn't imagine returning a food item to a grocery store, but I think it's generous that they offer this anyway.

Overall, though, Trader Joes is sort of as good as it gets for me. Friendly staff, awesome prices, even awesomer products, convenient parking.... Love it!!",2013-03-20 17:48:43

Nobody else was in the shop when I arrived.  I approached the front counter to ask which scones they have today.

The counter lady showed me the scones, which were on a cake stand that is displayed on the counter.
(Note: there are no covers on the cake stand with the scones, so I was skeptical about it. Since it is summer, I don't prefer food sitting out without any covers or else flies can come into contact with the food)

There was only two scones left, one ""cheddar & chive"", and one ""lemon & rasberry"". I was surprised there was only two left, and I am not sure if the baker will make more throughout the day. I was there near 3pm, yet the bakery closes at 6pm. So there is still lots of time left till closing. 


I opted for the cheddar & chive scone ($2.75)

The scone was really dense and filling. I like the texture a lot. However, I didn't think there was much cheddar taste to it. It would be better if it was more flavourful. But overall, the scone was fairly good.",2013-08-07 03:56:37

This park has tons- I mean tons- of fun water features with activities and sections for any age group, a huge climbing rope thing that made me quite nervous, and plenty of grass and shade to relax while the kids went crazy. This is a public park, so be prepared for huge crowds during the summer and that one group of unsupervised riff-raff teens that you can't quite escape from.

Just a few empty tables. The bar top was empty so we attempted to take a seat... The female bartender come up so fast and demanded my ID before I could even sit down! I realize i look young, but god damn! So just to be an ass I ordered a water. Seriously give me a minute. 

Now, that entire experience had set the tone... We had to ask to order any thing... She would not check on us... Then she argued about a mistake she made! Her shirt was so worn her name was no longer visible  and the entire time we sat at her bar we didn't know her name. Since I was starving I order the poppers and a side salad. They brought the veggie platter, she rang in an $8 salad. When I clarified what i wanted she blamed the mistake on the kitchen (I could see on the screen what she had rang in). When my husband tried to justify the confusion, there is no $8 garden salad on the menu, she argued and was defensive. From that point we could hear her complaining about us to other employees! Classy. We again had to ask the manager for the side garden salad... He was told we didn't want it. WTF!!!!!! We eventually got the apology owed from the manager... Not our bartender. He did his best to rectify the situation, which is why we stayed. 

She left with an attitude. John took over! He had one of those new shirts and a name tag! He did great! 5stars for john. When I ordered; he repeated and clarified my order. Everything met expectation, in the end. BWW isn't my favorite place to dine, but we were in a pinch... John was truly the saving grace tonight. Very knowledgable on menu items, cracking jokes and working hard. We gladly showed our appreciation in our tip tonight. He would be the only reason why we would return.

The details.

The Pro's
*Amazing beer. The most important aspect of a brewery. Check out the coconut porter. Honestly, I would not be raving about this place the amount that I am if the beer was just ""meh"". This beer is good. 

*On Tuesday's they said that they will have a small batch of experimental beers. This is the most exciting news ever. They said that they will post on twitter and facebook what type of beers they are brewing- so you know in advance if you want to check out the limited small batch of awesome brew. Amazing.

*The tour was very informative and wasn't snotty. You can tell that they are excited about this. It is hard not to become enthusiastic with them.

*They did an excellent job designing the inside of it. They gutted out a majority of it and obviously put in a lot of effort to it.

*I see them around at a lot of events in Charlotte. They are always so professional. You can tell that they are in it to win it. I like that kind of ambition.

*They have a TV- for the sporty people. The TV is not dominating though. Smart move, NoDa brewery.

*They have this excellent garage door that can be opened up. This makes the tasting room feel larger and creates an excellent atmosphere.

The Con's
*No music. This creates a tense environment. Music is necessary. Even bad music (I did hear a rumor that they plan on having live bands)

*No food. A huge pet peeve of mine. When I'm drinking the booze- I want something to snack on. Food trucks would do well here. (They did have pretzels on Sunday. Perhaps they had them on Saturday but the masses ate them before we arrived)

*The parking is...sketchy. It is hard to know exactly where to park. It also has a creepy/industrial feel to it.

Even worse, once we had our food, we didn't see our server for a solid hour. Only two of the five of us had our plates cleared, and yet AGAIN we had to ask our server to come over, so we could request our bills.

It was also really cold, and the ceiling seemed to be dripping...

I think the back section of the restaurant where we were would be nicer in the summer, there was a greenhouse-like roof. 

The food was decent, fair pricing (I had a burger that was $9), apps weren't too much, they had a lengthy menu (diverse, veggie options, burritos, burgers, sandwiches), AND what appeared to be a good dessert menu. We left, because of the dripping...

I would go back in the summer, and give Utopia a second chance.",2011-02-21 04:48:08

This came following a year of nonstop coworkers cheering about how wonderful Monta was and how it made other establishments in Vegas, particular Anime Ramen, look bad.  So needless to say, my expectations were really high.  

It should be mentioned that Monta was incredibly authentic to the point where everything that I loved and hated about Japan was en-capsuled by this establishment:

Too small to fit a decent crowd so there was a 45 minute wait late night on a Friday?  Check.
Hard benches?
Check.
Tiny waiting space?
Check.
Completely open mail slot in the middle of December with a door that didn't close so it was incredibly drafty and wet and miserable?  
Check.

At some point I was actually convinced that this was their plot: Make you so hungry and cold and put-out that you would just find the food euphoric when you finally arrived.

Not to mention that they were OUT of miso so anything that had miso in it was not an option.  Seriously, my favorite thing on the menu?  You're out of it??

So finally managed to get to our food and the taste was great.  Broth was wonderful, noodles perfectly cooked.  Was it worth the wait?  Not reallyI just wanted to flee to Curry Zen whose attitude is blah but food is a staple for me.

To start, the water tastes like bleach or chlorine. 

The mochi wasn't soft or fluffy.. Just really chewy and the only thing you can taste is whatever powder is sprinkled on top. The waffles were made of tapioca like dough so it feels very under cooked and extra chewy.. not a fan. Doesn't do anything for the flavor. The marshmallow looks interesting but it was so chewy it made it a little gross. I expected something melty and sticky and a delicious toasted marshmallow flavor with yummy ice cream in the middle. It was not that. It was a thick ""marshmallow"" shell made of what I think is more tapioca mix with so little ice cream in the middle.. tastes like nothing...

The milk pudding was okay. The flavors are not strong enough. Congee Queen and Kenny's noodles does it way way better!

Went on a Monday evening at around 8 pm, there was no line up and service was fairly quick. I sat at the counter, it was fun watching the chefs.

Not the best buffet in Vegas and not the cheapest (running about $12.95), but you can expect some good spice from the buffet options.

What sets Gandhi India Cuisine's buffet aside from other Indian buffets in Vegas is the surprising spice.  The general tendency in an Indian buffet is to keep it bland.  The buffet has to make a lot of different palates happy and the general tendency is to keep it bland to make the most folks happy.  But cheers to Gandhi for not skimping on the spice.  

They usually have several vegetarian options in the buffet and a number of delicious chicken dishes.  There's some real hit and miss going on with the dishes.  I loved the paneer in spicy butter cream and the chicken tikka masala.  And thumbs up for the naan and the okra dish.

Upon entering one myth was shattered as it is not a hole in the wall. It seemed a casual place but decorated nicely. 

Ordered a Green Mango Salad to start which was 2.5/5. The quantity was good, but lacked enough dressing. 

Ordered a Thai Fried Rice, two Tofu dishes - Country and Golden and a Hot Thai Noodles with a spicy scale of 20 chillies. 

The Fried Rice had great curry flavour and vegetables, but the quantity was a huge disappointment. Hardly enough for a person. The Country Tofu was disappointing as well. Not enough flavour and a almost watered gravy and the quantity again not too much. The rice provided was enough. The Golden Tofu was a hit. With flavour and and coconut milk this was perfect except for the quantity. 

The most anticipated dish was the Hot Thai Noodles. We normally ask for less oil, which we forgot and so it seemed too oily for us. The flavour was good, the spices good, however it wasn't 20 or a killer spice.

It's located on the bottom floor of the Rio underneath the Chippendale's showroom. It was pretty centrally located in the Valley which worked for all of us and I enjoyed not having to pay for parking, yet.

The staff was super easy to work with and even set us up with drink tickets for the circle bar right across the way. The golf course itself was super easy & didn't provide too much thrill, but I could see how any Kiss fanatic would be obsessed. 

I do wish this location had a full bar inside like the old one used too, but I'll settle for a better part of town over a full bar any day. I'd def recommend this place for a group outing or party of any kind.",2017-11-08 19:50:45

The staff is extremely nice & even went out of the way to make cocktail sauce from scratch since they aren't serving it this summer. The waitress said they were known for the fried shrimp sandwiches, so the boys got those. And coincidentally all the girls opted for the truffle crab Mac and cheese. Don't be fooled-it's a ""small plate"" but is still really filling. The Mac and cheese was 4.5/5 stars for me. Really, really good. The boys loved their fried shrimp sandwiches. I snuck a bite out of my hubs sandwich and instantly decided that when I come back, that's what I have to have. The spicy mayo on it was also really good. We also shared a side of the panzanella. It's basically a crouton salad with some heirloom tomatoes, arugula, and shaved Parmesan marinated in balsamic vinegarette. My husband and I enjoyed it. Wish there were more tomatoes though.

I'm writing my review late, so I imagine some things have changed, but seeing that I probably won't be back for a while, I wanted to put my 2 cents in.

The layout and atmosphere was beautiful and unique. It's a real shame they opened in the late fall, because The Porch is definitely a place built for the warmer months. It has a lot of large garage-type doors meant to blend the outdoor area with the diners. While it was still gorgeous on the inside, even in the cold, there was clearly something missing when you looked around and noticed that the nuts and bolts will compliment a Summer breeze better than snow.

The food was pretty decent. We ordered 2 appetizers, which were wonderful. My meal, the roasted pig sandwich, was good, but a little salty and bland. I'm not knocking them here by the way, because I do understand that it takes time for a restaurant to figure out the flavors and it doesn't always happen within the first week. It isn't until a lot of patrons are able to offer feedback that they begin to refine their dishes.

The price is where it gets a little bit tipsy for me. Our meal was $80, which isn't terrible, but it comes off a little more casual than the receipt. But I'm not dumb either, we did get 2 beers each, 2 appetizers and a meal each. The money was well spent, but it was difficult for me to understand exactly what type of restaurant they wanted to be. Classy? Casual? Either way ... go try them out! They are a welcomed addition to the Oakland area.

Before I close this ... one pitfall did hit me. My friend ordered a pizza and it came on a huge cookie sheet / pan. While this aesthetically was kinda cute, it took up a ton of space and downgraded the experience slightly. It goes back to my statement about what they were trying to be. Who wants to eat slightly pricey pizza on a pan that takes up most of their table space? Just a thought!",2012-03-09 14:28:48

at any rate, do yourself a favor and order the following:
- Chinese Chicken Salad - ask for extra lettuce. I know, super not authentic BUT I can't get enough of this stuff. I could do without the breading on the chicken, but eh.
- Hot Spicy Sichuan Prawns - yup, can't go wrong with something battered and deep fried... but the sauce has great flavor and my fave part are the cucumbers used to decorate the dish. haha.
- Peking Duck - delicious. I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, but it is pretty darn good quality.
- House Special Chicken - I would get the sauce on the side (if it doesn't already come that way). My mom saves the extra sauce to make Ma Po Do Fu at home. 
- Salt and Pepper Calamari - actually, any of the salt and pepper dishes, I love because of the chopped jalapenos that come with the dish! So good on top of rice. 
- Sichuan Style Green Beans - These are good; a tad on the greasy side but I am almost convinced that that is how it's supposed to be, since it's always that way everywhere we go.

My family and in-laws eat here several times a year, and we actually had our wedding rehearsal dinner here - hence the GIANT dragon/phoenix art on the west wall.

Quality - 3 star furniture. I sat on a few sofas and chairs and for the price, I have no idea how the price can be justified for the quality.  These are high priced items. A sofa costing 900.00 but very uncomfortable, unless your a lumber young child. 

Prices - 3 star. I felt that the prices Overall are overly expensive for the quality. Great for apartment dwellers and students and anyone who want a more minimalistic approach with their furniture. 

Service- 5 star. I feel everyone here is top notch. From the traffics staff to the floor staff everyone likes to help. 

Must see-  this is a place that is a must visit. I enjoy walking around and window shopping. I enjoy all the ideas. I will hit things here for my kids for sure. 

Food- I will review this place again when I go back for the food. During this opening time, it was super busy.

They have big bulk bins of all kinds of things, from different types of flour, flax and nuts to dried fruit, yogurt pretzels and chocolate-covered fruit/nuts.

We checked in on Yelp and got a coupon for a free ""Drink"" so we had the Bloody Mary.

Our server highly recommended the ribeye sandwich which is served with blue cheese crumbles, arugula and sautéed onions, so we both ordered it.  It looked good and tasted fine until the third bite which rendered a mouthful of greasy fat.  I opened it up and realized it was a full 12 oz ribeye on a roll, MASSIVE layers of lard and all.  I understand that ribeye steaks are fatty - that's what makes them tasty.  However, if I'm eating one as a steak, I trim the big fat off.  Otherwise a forkful of it is just gross.  It's no different in a sandwich, and was thus surprised that more effort wasn't made on this $19 meal.  See photo for visceral details.

We also enjoyed the onion tacos, the flautas, carrots, fritters and churros.  I also loved the squash and broccoli from the soft opening. I loved the ""creamy"" sauce on the flautas and really like that you get to try so many items since it is pretty much a tapas restaurant.

We ordered the following items:

Pan Fried Leeks: eggs, glass noodles, leeks pan fried into crispy panzerotto shape like. Its tasty and well worth it.

Braised beef wrapped in foil: You have to eat this hot, otherwise, it just won't taste as good. The texture of this beef is alright and the flavour is fine.

Lamb Kebab: Has some secret spice on it. Again, have to eat it hot, otherwise, just not as good.

Tofu Skewer: Has same spice as lamb but with Hoisin Sauce (chinese oyster sauce). This tasted alright.

Ordered two style steamed buns: One had chicken, the other is pork. Both tasted fine.

We each also ordered their famous 'pulled noodles'. You can see the person pulling it long and slap it hard on the surface and does a slight twist and continues to do that until the dough becomes stretchy and fine.
- there are two pulled noodle types. One is more like rice noodles flat but this one tasted thicker version. We had the other which is more ramen style, thin which I preferred. 

My noodle soup was the duck meat, cha siu, bok choy.
- the broth tasted good, with the noodles it tasted better. The toppings are good usually, but not in soup b/c it takes away the flavour of the meat and makes the skin soggy.

My gf had the same noodles like me but with pork chive dumplings made fresh as well.

This includes specialty foods, produce, organic foods, vegetarian foods, wines, and at this location beer. When you are about to walk out, you pay at checkout lanes named after the local roads. For example register 1 would be Green Valley Parkway and register 2 would be Sunset Road.

  I typically visit Trader Joe's after work. I will be in the shopping center doing errands or hanging out in Dylan's. Before getting in my car, I will pick up some items at Trader Joe's. Their blackberry juice is the bomb. I don't know any supermarket selling it. Their frozen foods chicken & vegetable wonton soup and chicken chow mien would make a microwave meal in my apartment 3.5 stars on Yelp. The chicken noodle soup features the chunky noodles that my tastebuds highly approve of. I enjoy their onion ring chips and cheddar & horseradish potato chips. When I want to attempt to be the chef at cooking my version of eggplant parmesan, their eggplant and onions were quality and competitively priced. The only flaw is they  failed to stock margarine and spread. Their butter is $ $. With that said, Trader Joe's is not one-stop shopping. Just unique-stop shopping. But, Trader Joe's does charge rock bottom prices on cold bottles of water that start at 17 cents. 

  The shopping environment is friendly here. This urgency to be in and out that is common in the large supermarkets is replaced by people enjoying the experience of buying these items. I am one of the customers deciding what to try next. The employees are friendly. It is my understanding they earn $10 to $20 an hour. The old saying is that you get what you pay for. The upshot is that the employees talked to me when I paid for my items and even remember me as the customer that buys the blackberry juice.

   As it stands, I will trade with Joe again. The store is near my apartment and convenient to my errands. Come to think of it their ice cream sounds good. Their chocolate chip cookies sound really good. And their frozen pizza sounds fantastic. Yeah, I'll definitely be back :-)",2014-07-17 05:14:44

4VyVhluni_QXHlfB2fX8Jg,bx5FaM2uoyRS7sKzSlffqA,JpgVl3d20CMRNjf1DVnzGA,4,1,0,0,"We go to Pampas in Planet Hollywood Miracle mile area often, we recommend it to friends coming in to Las Vegas. In act I even suggested my friend use Pampas for her reception dinner after her wedding dinner coming up this spring (probably 40ppl). 
  Pampas has high quality food (wish they'd stop pre-dressing the Caesar salad though) & good quality meats. When I brought friends from MI here this past Feb we really enjoyed the fun made to order drinks that the lady makes at her cart-going table to table (fyi-2 of the ladies that work there are past Olympian's in Volleyball). 
  We always get great service & very pleasant ... not the case today... from the get go our server ""Kelly"" was rude. She spoke to me in a very condescending tone... kinda like she was annoyed with me. I am one of those people who doesn't like bloody meat. I had asked 3 different Rodizio's if I could get some cooked a little more. Typically this is no problem. I was sitting & waiting & sitting &  waiting (probably 20mins) while everyone else got their mid rare meats. I finally saw the server again & asked her I she could please check on this for me. Instead she went off on me! I saw the people at the next table look over toward our way because of the tone she had used with me. ""Well it takes more than a minute to cook it!"" spoke very sharply & LOUD. I am normally not a drinker & try to stay clear of sodas. Kelly was good at refilling our water & taking away any dirty plates, this I will give her. But she is also very good at being rude to customers. Yes, I had a coupon... I know a guy who's wife works there, she said ""everyone uses coupons there-not a big deal"" If the company didn't want people to use coupons then they wouldn't give them out. It is NOT Kelly's place to judge me for having a coupon! Actually I never mentioned the coupon. When our bill came it was for dinner price (we came while it was still lunch price but ran over into dinner) And it said Wingate on it. I tried to get her attention but couldn't. As the mgr Kate (who is awesome) came by I said ""I believe that I have someone elses  bill as it also had sodas on it"" All of the sudden Kelly emerges & snapped at me that's how it's done when it's THAT coupon... I said ""but I don't have a wingate coupon"" her reply- a sharp ""yes you do, that's what you told me!!!!"" I had never mentioned any coupon at all to Kelly. She walks away clearly irritated at me. I said to Kate that this seriously is not  my bill. It actually would have been cheaper but I'm not trying to rip anyone off. Kate took it to Kelly... Kelly redid it, again for dinner. I said to Kate, we came at lunch time. Kate said she would take care of it. This time Kelly pretty much slams it down in front of me & it now it the same dinner bill but with 3 copies. She walks away without saying a work-her attitude said a lot though. I then go to Nelly the awesome hostess who sat us with the bill. She said ""oh no, you 2 were definitely here before dinner started"" Then Kelly says to me, once again rude as can be... ""I was told by the manager to make it for dinner!!!!!"" which I know was a lie. I did get it fixed to lunch. We tipped on the total bill before the discount. We tipped on the bank card so she would be forced to give the rodezios their share & we tipped about 18%-20% on the pre-discount price. I understand that the meat rodezios might have forgot me. BUT the attitude & rudeness that I received from Kelly was uncalled for.  
  I will go again, I will continue to tell friends about Pampas, I hope that my friend does have her after wedding dinner at Pampas. I will just make certain to request NOT to have Kelly as my server & I will tell my friends to request not to have her as well. 
  I definitely recommend this place, it is yummy & actually a good price for being on the strip. They have coupons & deals online, thru out the casino, on groupon, on restaurant.com. The people who run it realize that it's cheaper to do coupons than it is to pay for commercial time. 
  So my advice to anyone reading this.. go to Pampas, enjoy it, it's great there but request to not have Kelly as your server. You want to enjoy your meal experience... a Brazilian Steak House is an experience. Just don't have Kelly  as your server or your experience will be ruined! And by the way, it was steady there but not so packed that Kelly was over burdened. I have worked in restaurants in my life (I even went to culinary school) there was no reason for her nastiness!",2014-08-28 05:17:21

That opportunity came up today. My cousin and I arrived around 2:00pm and I found it a bit curious that the place was almost empty, today of all days, Mothers Day, traditionally the busiest day in the restaurant industry.

Like a lot of AYCE sushi places I've been to, we placed our order through an app on an iPad. The food started arriving quickly, probably less than within a minute of ordering.

Everything looked okay but some of the portions looked tiny. That was okay since it meant we could order a wider variety of things and just keep ordering more if we were still hungry.

The food was just okay, not bad but not great. I've had better sushi at other places. The beef dishes were all overcooked (see beef enoki photo) and most dishes had too much sauce.

The service started out good, fast and efficient but halfway through our meal, it got slower. It took them longer to clear empty dishes. They brought an incorrect order to us. They forgot to bring a can of Coke and some ice cream. The table was full of empty plates when we asked for the bill. Forget the ice cream.

At $26.95 (for lunch), this was not a good value. Drinks were extra. Unfortunately, we left a little disappointed.",2017-05-15 00:11:19

Note: their medium is medium, unlike Calisan, where the medium is pretty hot.

We had the veal sandwich and it was great, good bread, not too too much sauce, a little salty, but that wasn't a big deal. Totally worth it, I will go here again for their meatball sandwich.",2010-07-10 22:22:47

gg1HsyZdJwmBCVvpY-zcZg,B5FTjNWSgkAQ9UjOKVjGhw,Bg8xZT4-NsYLYd-WPIhgXw,4,3,1,3,"Hungry for some of Kevin Sousa's food, but the menu at Salt doesn't change frequently enough for your taste? While you wait for Union Pig & Chicken to open, Station Street Hot Dogs offers you a late new years gift - a closed hot dog shop, revived by Sousa and his brother to create fun but still sophisticated food.

Upon walking in to the shop, you're greeted with two familiar features - First, a wide open kitchen, striking due to the fact that a hot dog joint is usually the type of establishment where you'd rather not see environment your food is being cooked in. This, though, is spotless and currently manned by some familiar faces from Salt's kitchen(easily identified by their tattoos and Salt T-shirts under their aprons).

Second, a large chalkboard menu above the register. Hot dogs range from a standard dog($4) to a Sweetbread-laden frank topped with an apple mostarda($9), with most of the dogs featuring American(Chili,saurkraut) or Asian(kim chi, sweet soy sauce) influences. Other items on the menu include fries, optionally fried in duck fat($3/$5) and mexican coke($2). Around the outside of the restaurant is a bar with stools for seating, and a few trays of condiments(ketchup, mustard, salt, pepper, vinegar, sriracha).

We ordered a Hawaii dog($5), a Devil dog($5), and a Kim chi dog($7), along with fries. The Hawaiian dog tasted fantastic, sweet and salty all at the same time, though I wasn't pleased to find a small garnish of fresh mint, an herb that I'm not fond of. Surprisingly, the mint wasn't a deal-breaker for me, but I would have enjoyed it more without. Also, they are unfortunately not immune to the age-old mistake of putting watery toppings on a hot dog - the bottom of the bun turned to mush and the two halves had split by the time I could pick it up. The devil dog was a bit bland, egg salad, tabasco, and potato chips tastes about how it sounds, and was not very spicy at all. As a chilihead, I'd prefer to see a non-tabasco hot sauce used here, and this turned into the spicy dog expected it to be.

The kim chi dog was the star of the show, though. If you've ever gone to the Brooklyn Flea and stopped at Asia Dog, you know how wonderful of a combination kim chi and hot dogs can make. I've searched high and low for a competitor to those wonderful dogs, and now there is one mere blocks away from me. Covered in kim chi and kewpie mayo(a japanese brand of mayo made with vinegar and egg yolks), garnished with bonito and strips of nori, the flavors of this were spicy and creamy and bold and salty - my favorite combination. I did find the price tag to be a bit hefty, but I've spent more on bad downtown lunches, so it could be worse.

The fries were tasty, well-fried and salty, but not particularly notable. My only other complaint of this place would have to be the atmosphere - it was almost dead silent, even the guys calling out the order numbers was quiet. A hot-dog joint where you sit on barstools, to me, should be boisterous - cooks yelling, pans banging on the griddle, etc. Hell, at least put in a jukebox or something.

Other than that, this is an awesome reinvention of an East Liberty landmark. I urge you to come give it a shot and see what an inventive hot dog can taste like, especially with the awesome hours(open until 11pm Mon-Sat!!). Also, I urge you to take a look at the fantastic website of this establishment, I was really impressed by the design.

--Also, they offer Smart Dogs as a veggie replacement for any menu item. I'm not a fan of them, though, as their texture is too far off(feels like lumpy pudding) - I wish they'd take advice from Franktuary and get a local option, and a veggie option that doesn't try to imitate.",2012-02-11 01:15:17

Decided to head over here with a couple friends that frequent AYCE with me often since they were offering a 15% off grand opening special!

The space was nice and simple, not going overboard with decor or ambience. A cozy, manageable size with enough seating, they area was well light and had a welcoming vibe. 

As with the latest trend, Sumo offers iPads to assist with ordering. There is a great convenience to this, and orders get in really quick. Unlike other places I have been to, the iPads they had were well kept, and did not have issues on their screens making scrolling any harder than it needs to be. 

They didn't have any outstanding or exceedingly memorable dishes, but the overall quality of the food was good. A couple notable mentions would include the Salmon Tartare, a couple of the Torched Sushi, and the sashimi was quite fresh. The Scallop Sashimi was especially good. 
However, there were a couple dishes that could of improved. Overall, the meat options were rather limited and the ones they had left something to be desired.

Service was quite good and servers were quick on their feet when prompted or requested. A few times we did have to call over a server that was just standing around to get something or had to request something more than once. Areas to improve.

Checked it out again for dinner this week, even though my past visits were deafening! We sat at the bar and the friendly bartender took care of us right away and brought us the massive beer list - I think there were 150 on draft! Oh my! We found out they give away Pint Glasses on Thurs night if you order certain beers, so I got the Sweetwater to get my free pint glass to take home! 

They have a big menu - sandwiches, burgers, wings and of course apps. We decided to split wings and they were really good! Hot sauce was just hot enough. My only gripe is they don't give you celery with wings, you have to order a side of celery for $0.65. I've never been anywhere that didn't include some celery with wings, I don't like that they nickle and dime like that. But, the wings were good so I'm over it.

We also decided to join their beer club - you get a card, get points, get free stuff. I'm already drinking beer, so I might as well get a free tshirt out of the deal!

My sister has raved about it since her first visit there many months ago. We decided to meet there for dinner one night because winter weather perfectly complements pasta. 

I am a foodie so when trying out a new place I like to look at the Yelp photos and review the menu before I go. The first thing I noticed is that basically every carnivore entrée was $18-$20. For pasta. So rave review from sister + touch pricey = high expectations.

I'd hang out here for a basic breakfast with my tablet or newspaper if I were a hotel guest. But the food quality was not that great, and service was lacking. 

I ordered Huevos Rancheros. First of all, it came out looking like a hot, soupy mess suffocated with cheese. I had to send a posse to search for the corn tortillas. They were located at the bottom of the mass, drenched and drowned. No flavor at all. They may well have been made out of construction paper. 

If I hadn't read the menu I wouldn't have know there were retried beans in this pike. I mean, were there any? I don't know. The only distinguishable ingredients were the eggs, bell peppers and cheese. Oh, and some ""salsa."" 

Now, to be fair, you shouldn't expect excellent Mexican food at a general cafe-style restaurant, but this was beyond bad. The reviewer who called the place Bland Cafe was right. No flavor. 

The waitress pretty much forgot us. Didn't ask if we needed anything. No drink refills, nothing. We had to flag her over a couple of times for minor requests. Just disappointing all the way around.",2015-05-02 20:32:20

The best thing about Yelp is meeting a fellow Yelper in real life, going somewhere that you've both Bookmarked, and having a new friend!  This is what happened on my most recent trip to Las Vegas, the 9th Hawaiian Island.

Terri R. & I agreed to meet here because of the great reviews from Nadine J., Russ C., Mike O., Lilian N., Norm K., and other friends.  I arrived first and was greeted warmly by the owner who welcomed me in from the gray, overcast, cold, rainy morning.  Terri was right on time and we both got to choose where we wanted to sit!  

We shared the fluffy Short Stack Pancakes and I got the deliciously light Greek Omelet with the crisp but moist hash browns and wheat toast - everything was perfect!  The serving was so large that I had to take the leftovers to go!  The prompt and friendly service, the yummy food, and the ""blue"" environment was excellent!

I'll start from the beginning though- 
The spa is beautiful and bright when you enter - much bigger than I thought it would be too! The staff assisted me right away and had me fill out a form. A few minutes later I was taken into the room for my services. 
The room was pretty small, but very nice and relaxing. The woman who did my services was quick and efficient but left almost immediately after finishing. Thus, when I inspected the waxed areas, I noticed she had missed a few spots (and not just a hair or two but actual full spots). I was pretty disappointed by this due to the fact that Donato is very expensive and considered to be high quality. I have visited other spas that actually encourage you to check everything before they leave the room. 
Since the waxer had already left the room, I didn't feel comfortable leaving to find her and getting it fixed - and that's my problem. 
Over all, I won't be back for waxing services but the spa itself is great, as were the staff at reception.

This isn't the free course that you can get at some other stores(where you still have to buy their ammo and pay a range fee). This is a very detailed course that is perfect for the non-gun person who wants to protect them self. No prior knowledge is required, so if you're new to guns don't be intimidated, you'll leave with a good idea of how to protect yourself and how to operate your firearm!

The shooting qualification is where this class really shines. Your average class has you shoot from a bench at the required yardages, and that's it- nothing like what a real encounter would be like. Sarge's class has you draw and fire, practice reloads under pressure, move-and-shoot, and really focuses on good shooting technique for the layman. You will be far better prepared for a real world encounter after taking this course than if you go to one of their 'free' competitors.

I got their version of pad thai last time I was there, since they didn't have a green curry on the lunch menu, and I was really surprised and pleased by it.

Service was friendly and attentive.  The environment does take some getting used to, but the drinks were all well-crafted and top notch.

My own visit was for after work drinks--not too long after the lounge opened at 5pm.  The space was empty except for one table, but I was first struck by how overwhelmingly dark the room was.  How did people in the 1920's read drink menus without the light from iPhone screens?  Screw it; I put the menu down.  ""I'll have an Amaretto Sour (with egg whites),"" (somehow communicating the parentheses).  This is my favorite drink at Velvet Tango Room, and one I've started making for myself and instructing on how to make to anybody behind a bar willing to listen.  After a minute or two, the bartender came to the table and explained that they didn't have amaretto but could put something together using their house-made almond syrup.  The end result was pretty good:  I still think it would have been better with amaretto, but he absolutely nailed the rich, frothy top that makes the cocktail memorable.

When it was time to order drink #2, my eyes were more attuned to the darkness and Kelly (our fantastic server) happily assisted me in navigating through the menu to something I might like--a Blood and Sand.  As awful sounding as that title may be, it was an excellent drink--one of the best I've had in recent memory--and had some added flair from the perfectly spherical ball of ice inside and the orange zest flamed as it was being served.  

After that, more customers started to file in, and the lounge singer started to do her thing with the piano player playing along.  Drinks #3 and #4 were wholly omakase (""One drink, please!""):  A refreshing Cucumber Gimlet and a Kentucky Mule served in a copper mug and copper straw.  Both were very good, and fit the pace and moment just right.

And as I sat there wondering why the metal straw market hadn't taken off, it was time to go and find something to eat.

* Comparisons to Velvet Tango Room are inevitable.  The location of Society Lounge is substantially more convenient for downtown activities, and I get the sense that Society Lounge is more focused on mixology whereas VTR has a full stable of well-made (and well-described) cocktails.  In any event, it takes more than one visit to reach those heights.  I'd be interested in the future to see (a) how far this mixology can go, and (b) how Society Lounge handles big crowds.",2013-05-12 06:17:11

I've gotten my inspections, oil change, smog check, airbag diagnostic, and AC unit replaced with them.

Our server was very friendly and helped us out with a confusing section of the menu (it was unclear how many sides were included in the price for some main courses).

We had to wait quite a long time for our food, but it really was worth it. The comfortable booths, the tv and the arrival of some dishes which were accompanied with fire and flames to the table next to us ensured we didn't mind waiting too much. 

Everything was lovely, I liked the large, open-spaced, comfortable layout of the restaurant and am eager to return.

This probably isn't the best option for traditional Greek food on the Danforth, as it's a chain, but it's definitely a fun, cheap, filling and flavoursome choice.",2014-06-17 15:53:36

Had a great lunch today and the cute very small bartender whose name I forgot to get was Excellent
Really took care of the people at the bar as well as people at tables in bar area and outside patio
Food was great 
One glitch was when my food was brought out by what I found out a new waitress it was not mine and I asked her 2x's if this was what I ordered and she said yes!
I ordered Del Monaco steak sandwich less bun with fries and she brought me a cheeseburger no bun with fries!!
Then I showed my plate to bartender and she got me the. correct food
I understand being new but after asking 2x's the new waitress should have said she would check with chef not leave plate and hurry away
I will go back because the food is great and usually the service is great also",2017-06-18 15:16:23

This strip mall breakfast spot is pretty nondescript; from the outside you could as easily except to find mattresses lined up inside as opposed to dining tables. 

As soon as you get in the door however, the restaurant takes on an slightly warmer atmosphere. The dining space is still pretty much one big open area, which lends itself to being a bit noisy, but the paint colors are warm and welcoming and reminded me a lot of a First Watch. 

The menu though is much larger than First Watch. Since pancake is in the name of the place it's appropriate that there are over 20 varieties on the menu. Additionally there are egg entrees. Today I got to try both as all egg plates come with a side of three pancakes. I ordered the Eggs Benedict. I changed from the Canadian bacon to the regular bacon, which was cooked perfectly and had great flavor! The eggs were poached properly and all combined well with a slightly crunchy English Muffin. A side of red skin potatoes were seasoned well and still had some skin attached which was a nice touch. 

For my pancake side I kept it simple with blueberry pancakes. These were served with a side of blueberry syrup. The pancakes were of good texture and weight. I was impressed that the small blueberries were evenly distributed through the entire pancake and did not come out the bottom of the pancake. 

I also was impressed with the fresh squeezed OJ. I'd go back here. I'd like some more bacon. And I'd like to be more adventurous and try some other more decadent pancakes.",2016-01-31 00:32:18

Designate one ORDER HERE, the other PICK UP HERE. Other restaurants seem to grasp this concept I don't know why they do business this way. It's probably frustrating for everyone including the employees who looked overwhelmed themselves. Okay, enough of that. 

The food was average at best. Good if you're really hungry. I'll be honest, I only came here because the line for Tacos El Gordo was insane and the yelp reviews were positive. I ordered a quesadilla for my kids, very greasy but they seemed to like it. The carne asada fries I ordered had nacho cheese on them, ugh! Nacho cheese? It's carne asada fries, not nachos.

Before this past weekend I had never been to the main branch of Cleveland Public Library. 

That's right, never. I know, it's hurts me to think that with all the time I spend downtown that I've never been to this particular location. Although I've utilized some of the other CPL branches quite frequently, I'm still ashamed!

Well, all that guilt stops here because I'm officially addicted to this amazing Cleveland public resource! My first vision of the CPL was walking around the front. It's separated into two connected buildings, one new and one old. Isn't this just the ""Cleveland story""? It's such an old city full of rich history, but we're slowly updating all while maintaining the integrity of our past. I love that the CPL captures this idea. 

I walked around the back of the building and was pleasantly surprised by the gorgeous outdoor atrium! The design was something out of a story book. There were benches and chairs everywhere for you to plop down on, read and relax. At the center of it all was a unique and tranquil fountain with quotes and excerpts from literature. 

The interior of the buildings matched the look of the outside quite well. One reminded you of past Cleveland scholars or families who must have spend many of hours here researching and learning. The other was a look into the present day with all the resources you could ever need in a public library, plus more!  

Honestly, sometimes I forget what an amazing advantage I have in the CPL. If I need to rent movies (new ones!), books, music, etc., I can do it all for free! Need internet access or time on a computer? This is also free! You can even print off some pages of research. Looking for a book you can't find anywhere else? You'll find it here! If not, they'll contact one of the other Cleveland branches and get it for you. Visit their website and you can order books and even set up email reminders for due dates! This is huge for me because I always forget those pesky dates. Oy, all those fines!

This is an incredible asset for the youth of Cleveland as well. It gives everyone the access to educational material, no matter what your situation may be. Whether you need to study, chill out, get away, do some research or even just have some quiet time, CPL is there for you! Utilize this amazing resource we have in Cleveland!",2010-08-23 21:44:23

Obviously, as a vegetarian, a place like this doesn't provide a whole lot of options, so I went with a couple apps. My brother, a meat eater extraordinaire had the pulled pork sandwich. My apps were pretty gross deep fried average bar food. My brother wasn't happy with the very gristly pulled pork. The highlight for me was the beer.

I don't know if this technically counts as new since I've been a fan of their beans for a while now (these are the beans they use at the Root), but regardless I'm excited to see them open for business.  

Let me start by saying that this is more for the coffee connoisseur than the casual fan.  And I don't mean that at all in a snobby or condescending way.  For real, I had to look up how to spell ""connoisseur.""  It's just that this is closer to a brewery or winery's tasting room than it is to a traditional coffee shop.  Just like you wouldn't go to Great Lakes to get a Miller Lite, don't come here expecting to get a frappucino.  

When I walked in the first thing I noticed was the counter covered with beakers and bottles and brewing equipment that I've never even seen before.  It looked like stuff you'd see in a lab.  While I was waiting for my drink I watched them make a cup of coffee by fresh-grinding the beans, measuring out the perfect portion with an electric scale, placing them in some sort of tube contraption, precisely measuring the water temperature, and then pumping the brew out by hand like an upside down french-press.  All for one cup of coffee.  This is coffee as science and art, and as you'd expect, it's absolutely delicious.  

The actual building is great too.  You can see the coffee roasters sitting behind the counter and I loved the mismatched vases, decanters, jars and other glassware they use.  My only gripe is that there's not much of a cafe inside, just a few tall tables to stand at.  Since so much effort goes into crafting these drinks it would be nice to be able to sit and enjoy them.  They've only been open for a week though, so who knows.  

Overall, it's an absolute must visit for coffee fans!  I've been to a lot of coffee shops but I've never seen anyone do it like this.  This is coffee done the right way; I just hope it doesn't spoil me.",2012-07-21 18:15:44

Polish Hill is exactly that, tucked between Baum Blvd. and the Strip District, bordered East/West by Downtown Pittsburgh & Lawrenceville, it is a community fitting for a resurgence, a re-birth.

The one vestige that has harbored the bold souls that found this enclave years ago, is Gooski's.  A Polish Hill institution that has weathered the years well.  One cannot consume alcohol all day & night ( some may argue this statement), so it is only fitting that the newest Landmark for the community be a coffee shop.  Named Lili, in honor of Rob & Carrie's daughter, the space is calming and comfortable.  

On my last trip to the 'Brugh, I made it a point to stop by my old haunts 
( The Beehive,  Starbucks on Carson St., Primanti Brothers in the Strip, etc.) and to find a few new additions.  Lili Coffee Shop is definitely a gem.  I spent 3 hours here, bumped elbows with friends coming & going, even got a great recommendation for a Massage Therapist in the neighborhood (the next review...)

The cuisine is perfect:  Quiche, Chili, Cookies, Brownies, Granola, Biscotti, and of course great coffee, chai, tea, etc.  I had the Quiche, savory to the last bite and made from scratch by a local baker/chef (Blythe makes everything! )  Rob's easy-going nature and great customer service make the experience seem like your stopping at a friend's house.

There is also a small room in the back for studying or an impromptu jam session.  The location is convenient, just off of Heron and an easy walk from anywhere on Polish Hill.  With-in the same building, there is a Record Store (second floor, Mind Cure Records, a project of Polish Hill resident Michael Seamans and Dan Allen. The vinyl-only shop will sell from a stock of about 8,000 records, including local releases. ) and a Comic Book Trove (the third floor will host Bill Boichel's Copacetic Comics, which is relocating to Polish Hill from Squirrel Hill, where it's been since 2001.)

Make the trip, take a walk with your dog (yes, Lili Coffee Shop is dog-friendly) and stop for a great cup of coffee with a new friend.  I will definitely return when visiting Pittsburgh again.

I've been to Intersteer several times, mainly because of the food. They offer delightfully fresh and tasty chicken and pumpkin sandwiches.

The value is unbeatable - every dish is under or near $10.
Ultimately, it's a bar, and the inside is nicely furnished. The main issue is the ambience, and that's usually because of the music. It's either a jukebox at the whim of the clientele (and it goes silent when it's not fed with money) or some pretty bizarre musical acts that have turned customers, including myself, out to the street earlier than expected.

Fresh Market is a chain, but it feels like an independent specialty food market.  The fruits and veggies are comparably priced to your local Harris Teeter and you can usually find a few extra veggies (organic varieties, too!) that you wouldn't normally find at the Teeter.  The meats and cheeses are a little too pricey for my budget, but I love looking at them in the cases nonetheless.  The breads and flavored coffees smell delicious, and they have a great selection of premade dishes (salads, entrees, sandwiches, etc.) if you want to grab lunch to go or bring something home for dinner when you're in a time crunch (or can't cook).  

We stopped in this Fresh Market earlier in the week and got some great ideas for future meals to try.  Since we weren't going immediately home, I couldn't stock up on all the things I wanted to.  Refrigerated items don't tend to do well in car trunks for hours.  

I did browse and buy some of their fresh spices, though.  (Not to mention some fresh rosemary focaccia for dipping in olive oil!)  They have a wall of fresh spices in little Ziploc baggies that are usually much cheaper than the ones sold in the spice aisle in jars.

A group of girlfriends and I met here for happy hour and really enjoyed ourselves!  I arrived first and so was able to secure a parking spot right at the entrance of the venue.  The shopping area of this establishment was an eclectic mix of ""vintage"" and contemporary items ranging from leather jackets that sell by the pound and tree-hugger organic tees to hand-painted glasses and nostalgic candies in old-fashioned wrappers.  There's even a boxing rink for those who suddenly feel the itch to go a few rounds!  (Back to those vintage jackets- I took this to mean that every jacket was weighed and charged a fixed price per pound, but this wasn't so... Each jacket I tried on had a different dollar amount per pound assigned.  A gimmick that initially piqued my curiosity suddenly made me want to leave the shopping area and just head over to the restaurant and check out the drink and food offerings.)  The indoor dining area was set up for community-style dining, w/ long rectangular tables and high benches.  Outdoors, there were picnic tables and chairs on one side and a silver streamliner at the other where all food orders are placed, w/ people lining up to order, pay, and then retrieve their orders when called.  Another gimmick that I probably wouldn't mind if I were dining outside, but didn't care for since I was dining indoors w/ friends, a couple who'd ordered food and a couple who didn't, away from cigarette smoke and the cold air...

Two of the three girlfriends had arrived before the 6p HH cut-off, but one, Linda, had to take a call, and she was therefore left out of the ""duce off"" each drink deal.  This was the first time I ever had a grasshopper (cremes de menthe and cacao and cream over ice), and I enjoyed it very much!  So much, I bought my own supplies  to make my own version a few days later!  The friend who was not given the discount had originally wanted a light beer (@ 5:50p), but was told none were offered here.  We all liked our selections and agreed that we'd very much like to meet again for HH.

One of us is allergic to gluten (no, not me!) AND a vegetarian, so after she had asked HER set of questions, she ordered the omelet skillet, first w/ ingredients that the kitchen was out of (asparagus?), so she settled w/ mushrooms, spinach, and goat cheese.  She enjoyed the dish, and stated that the veggies were very fresh!  I had the Brisket sliders and an order of house-made potato crisps, which I was told were coated w/ EVOO and baked, not fried (the streamliner kitchen was not equipped w/ a fryer).  I found the chips to be too greasy and overcooked (see photos), but my gluten-free vegetarian friend found them addictive!  I liked the brisket sliders (""the best you've ever tasted,"" said a co-owner) at the restaurant, although I did find some of the meat tough to chew so I put those aside, but found the leftovers fatty and sinewy- a chore to chew- the next day.  Not worth ordering again.  Linda decided to order dessert to share- the baked cinnamon-pecan French toast.  This sweet looked so enticing that I finally broke down and tried it, even though I have a pecan allergy.  I ate the caramelized toast pieces around the nuts (which doesn't prevent an allergic response since the oil is baked throughout the dessert) and found THIS delight addictive!  I hope the kitchen comes up w/ other versions that use other nuts, such as walnuts, almonds, even hazelnuts...

Those of us that sampled the food agreed that while we may not be in a hurry to come back for a meal, us meeting here for happy hour is certainly not out of the question!",2011-02-22 00:18:46

My friend was having a bad day so we stopped in at 2:30 today. We were promptly and rudely told outside the front door that they close at 3 and would be ""kicked out"" if we were not done with our food by then. I understand the kitchen closing early so they can clean up but being told I had to leave promptly at 3 by an employee was totally out of line! If I'm going to pay $45 for two people to enjoy lunch I want to be able to actually enjoy it.

I'd go almost every week to donate clothing, get a 20% off coupon, and use it on some unique purchases. I'd always walk out with a couple bags of accessories, clothing, and books without spending over 20 bucks. However, I've noticed that they've been bumping up their prices over the past year or so. It has actually gotten quite pricey (in terms of Thrift stores). I haven't been able to find any decent tops for under 7 bucks. I know $7 sounds cheap, but not when you can go to a department store, like Ross, and get a brand new top for the same price (even less in the clearance section). Unless the shoes are super old and messed up, they're normally $10 or higher. This leads me to another point. I've come across so many damaged clothing here (normally tops). Whenever I do come across a top that's under $7, there's holes in it or some very obvious stain. These items shouldn't even be out on the sales floor unless they're for free. I mean, I understand it's a thrift store, but most other thrift stores do some sort of quality checking. 

Since Savers has been getting more pricey, I've been going around to other thrift stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army. I noticed that both Goodwill and Salvation Army don't charge any tax because they're non profit and they get all their goods from donations...just like Savers. The only difference is that Savers charges tax and has higher prices. So that 20% off coupon that you get when you donate doesn't really do much for you.",2011-11-05 00:51:20

These ladies are seriously miracle-workers and like my fairy godmothers, no joke. You know how they always say that you'll hit snags while planning your wedding? Yea I didn't believe that until I ordered my bridesmaid dresses online and what I received was NOT what I ordered -- they were a cheap wannabe knock off made in China. I cringed and almost broke down in tears when I saw the dresses. Knowing that dresses take months to come in, I went into panic mode, but luckily remembered about the Wedding Apparel Superstore. I rushed over there and told the ladies my dilemma, which they assured me they could help. And did they ever!!! They helped me order the perfect bridesmaid dresses, and assured me they would be here in time for my wedding (sure I had to pay rush shipping but I had to do what I had to in order to have the dresses here on time.) 

The long awaited day to pick up the dresses finally came, but -- for those who have planned weddings, you can't have it all, and it won't turn out the way you want it -- so wouldn't you know, the day before I was supposed to pick up the dresses, one of my ""lovely"" bridesmaids texts me (yup, you read that right, TEXT ME) to tell me she won't be in my wedding anymore... a week before my wedding... and she was a size 0 so good luck trying to find someone to fit into the dress. Oh, and on top of that, she even was kind enough to stick me with the bill. Great.

I went in to pick up the dresses and the wonderful ladies could see I was distraught; I explained what happened and that I had my best friend (who also got promoted to Maid of Honor) to step in, however she wouldn't fit into that dress... so the ladies got to work in helping us find a dress ""off-the-rack"" that matched the other dresses, yet allowed me to exchange the size 0 to the correct size. Phew! After trying on a bunch of dresses and almost coughing up more money to order yet another dress for my best friend, one of the ladies remembered there was a gorgeous dress that was in the back that would possibly fit my wedding needs and be the right size. Well, let me tell you -- these ladies were just wow -- not only was the dress perfect in size and color, but I was able to do an even exchange and not pay anything additional. Yaasssss!!! My best friend and I left happy, and I was at peace knowing that my wedding was back on track to being exactly how I imagined it would be. 

...and since I'm finishing this review after my wedding this past weekend, l gotta say -- the dresses were spectacular! The girls all loved them, they were a reasonable price, and the girls even told me where they plan on wearing the dress again... major score! Thank you again ladies for making my wedding dreams come true (with the dresses, anyway, my now-husband played a huge role in making my dreams come true!)",2018-07-27 22:32:05

Spinach lobster queso dip is just one of those things you can't mess up. I've had few places botch this one up, definitely something I would get again if I'm looking to fatten up a bit. The wings were ordinary.

The shrimp skewer (add $5) and lobster tail were tough; eating them is like gnawing on rock salt. Totally not worth the extra money, but it's all good because it was sponsored by my company (YEAUHHH BOIII). 0 stars for this one.

The creme brulee cheesecake was like crack - a huge portion of awesomely rich and creamy  cheesecake, topped with a thin layer of crystallized sugar. Could not stop gorging myself on this. If you like Key Lime Pie, you would love the one here, creamy and tangy, also served in generous portions. The brownie a la mode was decent, just stay away from the chocolate cake (dry and just bleh!).

X1QYyQcaq1ZFU4IhGs4Q3Q,-hUgrj7Lzir3yLUYrMYQ4g,HV25Suwkzd-roRc63sEmtA,4,6,0,3,"The is my favorite pho place around where I live.  The quality of the ingredients and the proportions of the dishes really stands out and puts VIP ahead of the pack.

The first thing I will say is that the reason this place didn't get a 5 star is the service.  Well, I'd have to say with any ""fast"" asian restaurant it's pretty much the same.  Expect to put the lid of your tea pot to refill tea and flag down a waiter or waitress if you want something.  Other than that everything is fantastic.

The size of the bowls of pho are very very generous.  To give you a comparison, I can usually eat a very large amount (I think I maxed out on 5 pounds of stuff in a sitting once).  I have a very hard time finishing the X-Large here; of course it's price reflects it.

One of the main complaints I have about Vietnamese restaurants and their pho is the quality of the ingredients.  I've had cases where the slides of ""rare beef"" are pieces of what looks like bucher remains of cuttoffs.  This place is not that.  If you decide that you like your rare beef on the side (I usually get that), you'll see that the slices are legit slices of beef that are very similar to hot pot beef slices.  

The nice thing about the noodles at VIP are that they are fresh noodles.  The main difference is that most other Vietnamese places use dried noodles that they rehydrate, this results in the noodle being more brittle.  The noodles at VIP are chewy and fresh. 

Another thing that is really good at VIP is the fresh spring rolls (rolled in rice paper).  First you may wonder why they usually come with your meal and not before it, but the reason is that they make it right there and then per order.  This results in softer rice paper that doesn't turn hard for a while.  I know a lot of other places make a bunch prior to a rush and put a sheet of damp paper on it.  Believe me, you can taste the difference this makes.

If you ever have a chance to pass by first markham be sure to hit up VIP.  You won't be disappointed.",2010-03-24 18:18:26

I've been going to this place almost every other weekend for the past three months now and needless to say, I EXPECTEDLY know that the service will be bad because when I visit the service is always bad - EVERY SINGLE TIME.

It is horrible - the wait staff lacks training, personality, and efficiency!  It is so disappointing!  I remember the original location on glendale and the restaurant was small and quaint, the wait staff was always so sweet and the place was so charming.  Spinatos decides to upgrade - bigger place, additional staff added and BOOM, the whole culture of what Spinatos used to be changed.  Spinatos now lacks personality, charm, and customer service.  Now, all they have going is the yummy pizza.

The last time we came here, we were already done with our food - my bf and I were just practically looking at each other getting more and more agitated  that we were sitting there with no one to ask us if we wanted dessert or if we just wanted our check.  We practically sat at our table with empty plates and an empty pizza tray for a good 15 minutes.  Finally, I catch eye contact with the hostess at front and she asks me if I need something, I yell at her ""the check!"" so she disappears and I guess looks for my waitress.  OMG!  The waitress slips the check to us and says ""thank you"".  No ""sorry about that"" and no type of remorse.  

What's so sad about this as as I'm writing this review and shaking my head is that I know that I will be back with the expectancy of bad customer service just because I love their GF pizza just that much.  It's kinda like a bad relationship where you break up, then get back together.  Then break up again.  Then get back together.  

So until I find another restaurant that has better GF pizza than Spinatos and who treats me right, I totally will break up with Spinatos for good and move on. So with that being said, Spinatos - please start treating me right because I don't want to lose you, but I deserve better.  I really do.",2014-06-30 16:00:56

They've added a bunch of new healthy themed restaurants too, none of which are open yet but all of which I am excited about. They even added places to get beer!!! They should all be open soon. A nice touch is that these places aren't ridiculously overpriced. $6 for a salad, $7 for a cheeseburger with fries. Not bad at all. 

The animals also all seem well taken care of with nice, big enclosures. Some of them have somewhat smaller ones but the majority of the animals have really nice spaces to live in.

I've tried a few of the shabu shabu places here in Las Vegas over the last few months and by far this is one of my favorites.

First off, there's plenty of parking due to the large shopping area. The Kojies lies right in the southwest corner of the lot next to a comic book store.

The decor is very plain and simple with a clean and artistic feel to the restaurant. With about 20 seats in the whole restaurant, you definitely have to make sure you come at the right time.

Your shabu shabu pot comes in 2 steps. First up being your choice of protein. They also have a salmon choice and an all vegetable choice as well. Once you pick your protein from ribeye, to pork to the Koji house special, you then move on to your choice of broth.

You have a choice of a spicy broth, a clear broth, and the tonkatsu broth.

You also get your choice of two dipping sauces. One of them being the ponzu which is my favorite.

Along with the pot and comes a vegetable medley with carrots noodles broccoli and lettuce for dipping. You also get your choice of white or brown rice and chopped green onions and garlic. If you want to kick it up a notch go ahead and ask for the house chili sauce which is made from ghost peppers.

The pot is placed on electric burner right in front of you and the fun then begins. The staff was amazingly attentive. From everything from checking to make sure our dips and broth were always full to make me sure our drinks for always refilled.  

Prices were pretty decent. Around $36 for the two of us, one with the meat protein and the other one with an all vegetable and one drink.

I definitely recommend this as one of the better shabu shabu places here in Vegas.",2016-12-20 19:51:55

We love paella! We go to San Diego's Paella Festival every year and always get paella if it is on the menu. The Mixta Paella was absolutely delish! We were able to finish it between the two of us. It was the perfect flavor with the perfect balance of rice and seafood.

The tapas were a-ok and I think I would be back just for the paella and possibly try different tapas.

The sangria was not very good but I think that's just my personal opinion.

Before the memory fades (a little).  I booked this as a surprised for my wife.  I planned something like this in NYC and it was cancelled.  I researched high and low in Groupon, Yelp, Google and I finally found the right spot.  I brought my wife, father-in-law, and I emailed the place to asked if my 9 year old can come and they allowed him.  This place was so updated and rustic.  The front seating ear was gorgeous.  The staff who greeted us was super nice even when we arrived 10 minutes early.  The staff member who brought us in our room and explained the rules was a little bit unclear on some things.  But maybe it was because we were super nervous.  Either way it was good.  I won't spoil any fun for anyone but my father-in-law who wanted to just sit and watched asked for a folding chair.  And 5 minutes in the timer he was up searching for clues with us.  This place is fun, small, and intricate.  Bring you A GAME and despite the instructions be open minded and just laugh and have fun.  We didn't escape because for the first 15 minutes we just stood around.  The people who was giving us hints (YES! they are watching you and probably giggling) will help you especially when you are stumped with a clue or not clear of what to do.  I definitely will book another session here.  This place is super fun and super professional with everything they do.  HIGH RECOMMENDED - HANDS DOWN.  We got Shanghaied and didn't mind it at all.  For 1 hour of laughter and nervous sweat it was well worth the cover price.

I think maybe in a past life I was a beautiful Asian woman!! In any case I took my co-worker Ruben to a place I just so happened upon online.. its called Thao's Sandwichs.. we walked in and found that we were the only non Vietnamese in the place.. all eyes turned on us.. Oh hell yeah, this was a VERY GOOD SIGN!!!  This means the food is going to rock my world and my tummy!

The place.. just awesome! We both had Banh Mi as well as Pho.. piles of fresh veggies and chiles.. loads of sauces, hoisin, sriracha as well as chile paste and soy.. the Banh Mi had one of the best crusty French rolls Ive had to date (sorry Saigon Sandwich) with ample fillings and an out of this world taste. I had the Pork Roll and Ruben had the special. Special was loaded with Vietnamese style meatballs (not the chewy ones) and covered with cilantro, chiles , pickled carrot and daikon..

We moved on to Pho.. I had the everything Pho including beef brisket, tendon and tripe.. in a delicious beef soup that wasn't salty as some other places tend to focus on.. seems to be quite a bit of complexity in that there soup! Then fishing around in there found all of those wonderful rice noodles.. then started covering it in Mules Ear, chile and Thai basil.. so many complex flavors all with a harmonious balance and aroma! Ruben played it safe with just the lean tender beef Pho. He can be such a daddy's little girl when it comes to new food experiences.

Appearance-wise, I expected good things from Happy Berry, which looks bright, colorful, and inviting when you're looking inside. Step in and it seems clean enough upon first glance. So just going off of what I saw, I was expecting a nice, tiny local shop - what wasn't to like?

In addition to the usual concerns about the shop's toppings that I have in most froyo shops (i.e. it's so important to keep those topping cups neat and clean, and anyone with allergies should ask for fresh ingredients from the back to be safe), I had two big problems with this place. One annoyance was that you're not able to get half of the yogurt flavors yourself here. Call me crazy but if you can't get all of them yourself, then why even bother making some flavors self-serve? All or nothing, guys. But whatever, that's nothing we can't deal with and certainly not worth a 1 star rating.

The big problem I had here was that the yogurt I ate was practically tasteless. I mixed the vanilla and cookies n' cream - my favorite combination - and added some of my favorite toppings. After excitedly digging in, I was disappointed to find that it was like I was eating the ghost of my favorite treat. The only part of my snack with any real taste was the toppings. The froyo itself was just...bland. I don't even understand how that's possible since frozen yogurt is shipped in liquid form and then put into a machine. But somehow, it happened, and this froyo lover ended up leaving Happy Berry feeling very unhappy indeed.",2013-05-10 18:22:12

I wanted it sans peppers but I suppose it's pre-made. It came with pita chips (not tortilla chips as on the menu). For main, I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak without red peppers and I was a little worried about the chipotle mayo (I can't handle most spicy foods) but it wasn't too bad with the cheese and steak. The sandwich had plenty of meat and while it looked small, was very filling. Didn't much care for the potato chips as they were a bit over salted but were a good pairing with the sandwich.

While the food was great, I was decidedly unimpressed with the service. The waitress was very nice but ignored us for the most part, even when we tried to get her attention.

T-Bones is an old school type of drive-in that is serving up some big hunks of steak as well as burgers, breakfast, sausages etc. all at insanely cheap prices. 

This place is located in a sketchy area of Scarborough, one that I would not recommend visiting in the middle of the night (although if you are having a steak craving at 3am, this place is open 24hours). The set-up is similar to that of a fast food chain, go up to the counter, order and wait for your number to be called. On this occasion I was not overly hungry so I opted for the 8oz New York strip which comes with a chef's salad and your choice of sides, I went for the roast potatoes. I also added some sautéed mushrooms to my steak, with the mushroom addition my total bill came to $12 and change. 

The best part of the meal was my steak, for those expecting AAA 30 day aged Angus beef, T-Bones is not for you. What I did receive however was a simple and honest hunk of meat cooked to a perfect medium rare just like I wanted. The steak was simply seasoned, had some nice grill marks and was not tough at all (although it did not melt in my mouth). The sides were a little sad though; the chef's salad probably came out of a bag and was topped with my choice of dressing, the sautéed mushrooms were clearly from a can which was disappointing. The roast potatoes were piled high on my plate and served in a red sauce. The potatoes were quite bland and not quite as tender as I would have preferred, although they did serve the purpose of filling me up. 

The service was friendly and my steak was prepared quickly. Next time I must come with a big appetite as they do offer 16oz steaks for under $15 and they even have 32oz steaks for the ultra hungry. The place itself was a little run down but was clean enough for a Scarborough drive-in. Overall T-Bones is a throwback place giving you bang for your buck, you will not get the white table cloth service and high quality meat but you will get value and a perfectly cooked steak.",2012-12-12 19:33:36

With all those folks who have differing ideas on food, we didn't do our typical sushi thing & didn't actually order. Had a bunch of the specialty rolls. I tried the crunchy roll, sakesake roll, potato spicy tuna roll & some yakotori. Everything was tasty. Of all that I tried, I definitely liked the sakesake roll best (spicy crab mix, cucumber & asparagus inside, fresh salmon & sweet onions on top served with some sort of apple sauce - not that apple sauce). It was good. The potato spicy tuna roll was interesting as well with sweet chili sauce and fried julienne potatoes on top.

Think I missed the albacore ceviche roll which I heard was quite good. Definitely some other interesting looking items on the menu as well.

The one criticism that I'd mention was that the service, while quite nice, was very slow and they were not crazy busy or anything.

With only a smattering of other restaurants within walking distance of the theaters (with the closest being wayyyy overpriced, arbitrarily pretentious and just underwhelming overall), there really hasn't been a great pre-show food option. 

Enter Sung's Kitchen, which just opened about a week ago. My friend and I discovered this new place while we were in the area trying to get a drink before a Yelp event across the street. 

First, the location is perfect! It is about 2 storefronts down from the main entrance of the theaters. 

Second, and more importantly, the food was DELICIOUS! The menu includes both Korean (ie, bulgogi and bibimbap) and Japanese (ie, chicken katsu and teriyaki) cuisine, with delicious sushi as the main event. We tried the spicy scallop rolls, a spicy tuna wrapped in cucumber (compliments of the chef), and the Hot Lover Roll. 

I wasn't wild about the spicy scallop roll; I guess I prefer the Americanized version with cooked scallops.  However, the Hot Lover was one of the best things I've ever tasted: a big pile of spicy tuna with more spicy mayo topped with sriracha, all on a little bed of crispy rice. YUM! 

My friend (who, like me, is 50% Korean in ethnicity but 100% Korean gastronomically) and I also each ordered the Korean Ramen, which was basically Neoguri (a childhood fave) dressed up with eggs, scallions and other veggies, to make for a very comforting and substantial meal. 

The prices were pretty on point and fair - our bill for too much sushi and two big bowls of noodles was just under $40, with lots of leftovers for lunch. 

While they don't have their liquor license yet, the very sweet owner (?) said she expects they'll have it in about a month, in which time I fully suspect this will be the perfect spot for dinner and cocktails for theater-goers.",2013-06-26 15:47:30

I ordered my standby of chicken pad Thai and after seeing the photos, added an order of the pineapple fried rice as well. I liked getting to choose the spice level for each of the dishes (a little spicy for the pad Thai and as mild as possible for the pineapple fried rice as I knew I'd be sharing that for lunch the following day). The pad Thai was nutty and delicious and everything I had hoped for (I probably could've made two meals out of the order as well but it was so good I couldn't resist) but the major stand out was the pineapple fried rice. It was sweet, savory, and had an amazing slightly curry taste. The rice was filled with cashews, chicken, a few shrimp, and plenty of pineapple. That did make 2 generous servings and I will be going back for that dish especially. 

In total, I think I've found a Thai restaurant to go to on this side of the valley which I'm really excited about.

The service at Figo is excellent. The food is nicely presented but extremely bland. 

I am thoroughly disappointed with my meal at Figo. Maybe it's because Toronto Life put it on the top restaurants of 2016 list, maybe it's because the owner typically puts out great restaurants, or maybe it's because of the head chef's credentials. It could be a combination of all three. I will most likely never return to Figo. It's a shame because there was so much potential.

The main issue is that the food is BLAND. 

We had:
Fig homemade ricotta cheese - 2/5 I got this because it was well reviewed in Toronto Life. The jelly was good, the prosciutto was okay (crispy) but the ricotta was noting special.

Margarita pizza - 2/5 There was a good amount of basil and the cheese was a decent quality but the crust sucked. I can't put my finger on what was wrong with it, but I have had MUCH better pizza. For a chef who came from BUCCA, this is even more of a let down. 

Arctic char - this was a substitute for the snapper which they were out of. 1/5 SO BLAND. They piled fresh herbs on top of this bland piece of fish, but what it really needed was some salt and pepper.

Scallops - 2/5 bland. Despite the herbs and sauce and roasted vegetables on top these scallops were not tasty. 

Black kale side - 2/5 for diet food this is a 4/5 but for a restaurant that is supposed to be tasty this just didn't deliver. This dish NEEDED salt.

For desert we had the chocolate gelato - 2/5 very heavy on the bitter cocoa. Good if you like that taste. The cookie it came with was just okay. 

All in all the food was extremely under seasoned and very disappointing. I don't recommend Figo.",2016-03-20 03:08:10

------------
- Great taste; so many flavours in one bowl
- Variety of ingredients and toppings
- Staff are suuuuuuuuper friendly and enthusiastic

Room for improvement:
------------
- Ordering process isn't perfect. They try to present it as very simple, but it's actually a little unclear if you can add freebie toppings to the set bowls. The first time, they asked. The second time, they added all but one without asking. 
- Price. I found $15 for the bowl too pricey. It wasn't very filling and was a bit on the small side. Pokito was opened in part by Chatime, so the overpriced menu makes sense.
- Way too little sashimi. It's pretty much one spoonful and makes the price even less justifiable. 
- Inventory management. The first time I went, they had no more salmon at 6:00pm, four hours before closing. The second time I went, at 9:00pm, they ran out of white rice and couldn't make sushi burritos.",2016-09-22 01:46:12

I chose to eat some sushi....at a cafe..... I KNOW, RIGHT!?! I paired it along with a sake and beer. I did not bomb the sake haha, enjoyed them both separately. I was impressed with the quality once again. Both the sushi and sake were surprisingly good and tasty given where we were at. I was very impressed with the sushi and sake combo. The waitress knew the differences between the different listed sake's, how awesome is that?! Just on the sheer fact that sushi at a cafe was superb speaks volumes of this place. I picked at my sister's and fiance's plates, both their dishes were great as well. I forget what they got, but I did enjoy them, I at least remember that.

The wine was Zinfandel and amazing, had three glasses and if I could have put more away then one more glass would have been great. Nice variety of beer and wine to choose from too. 

My plates had salad, jambalaya, craw fish, jumbo shrimp, sushi, pork spare ribs, egg rolls, prime rib, chicken breast, southern fried chicken, creamed spinach, enchiladas, street corn, and pho! The only thing that was on my plate I did not like was the pasta salad. It just had too many olives (side note I hate olives).

The box was tasty, and if I had to say anything negative about it. The beef was luke warm. I would even have to say it bordered on the cooler side of luke as well.

The people around us look like they ordered the AYCE, and judging by the size and look of the rolls I think I'll be back to try it.

This restaurant was the former neighborhood pub. 
I also wanted to add that upon entering the restaurant it seemed like it wasn't busy. That's because everyone was seated behind a wall by the main entrance to the left. This area was completely full. It's a big space, you can't really judge from the outside.

That doesn't mean it's bad, it just wouldn't be my first choice.  However, one of my absolutely favorite meals was when I was in South Korea.  It was one of only a few meals I really enjoyed over there and I was craving something similar to it the other night.  I really wanted Korean BBQ with tons of different condiments and the beef sizzling in front of me.  
Since the restaurant was close to closing, I opted for takeout instead.  I got the beef bulgogi and the spicy pancake.  For the spicy pancake I was hoping for something similar to a Vietnamese crepe or Chinese pancake but I got something completely different.  I think they need to re-name this dish because there was no pancake.  It was a bunch of really dense balls of dough (like super intense gnocci and a few strips of what looked like scrambled egg with an over powering red sauce.  I ate two of the dough balls and couldn't eat anymore.  I was actually starting to become nauseous by the smell.  This may have been my fault but then I googled Korean spicy pancake and saw plenty of pictures of what I thought it was going to be so maybe they gave me the wrong product or something.  I threw the rest of the huge dish out.
The beef bulgogi was just ok.  The meat was a little tough but the sauce was good.  There was just nothing standing out.  Also, they only give you three little side dishes.  The kim-chi was decent (definitely not homemade) but I found the noodles and spinach to be a bit bitter.  
Overall, it was disappointing.  The third star though is for the incredibly nice workers and for being accomodating even though they were close to closing.  I may try dining in but it's probably going to be a while before I crave Korean again.",2011-02-19 20:04:18

With appetizer choices seemingly more appealing, our small group shared tapas style, enjoying most everything hitting our bar top.

Starting with the best options:

Thai Sweet Chili & Bacon Prawns ($12). OUTSTANDING! Prawns are HUGE, butterflied & filled w/ cream cheese, and wrapped with a crispy slice of bacon saturated in sweet chili. Order this, or you're missing out on the obvious WINNER here! And don't worry, it's not spicy in the slightest.

Rolled Angus NY Strip w/ Asparagus ($14): Provolone, Basil, Sun-Dried Tomato & Marsala Mushroom Sauce. Excellent, thin sliced TENDER beef, pairing so well with the sun dried tomato & mushroom. Recommended!

Smoked Salmon Carpaccio ($13): Truffle Vinaigrette & Capers. Thinly sliced fish with just a hint of truffle fragrance. Very enjoyable!

Steamed Green Lip Mussels ($13): White Wine Tomato Broth & Garlic Bread. Tender shellfish in a creamy tomato broth, a bit mild in flavor, asking for a hint of salt/cheese to set it off.

Truffle Parmesan Fries ($8). Good amount of truffle oil, but towards the bottom pile, became hidden behind a plethora of SALT & salty cheese. It's been a long time since I've considered a fry almost too salty lol.

Marinated Olives ($8). All pitted for easy consumption, the large green olives were delicate and flavorful...the smaller Kalamata olives with a considerable amount of vinegar.

Truffle Mac & Cheese ($8). Well cooked pasta, nice cheese ratio and sharing size, but without a hint of truffle oil.

Baked Chicken Wings ($9). Good flavor, but missing the nice crunchy consistency found in the preferred fried variety.

Lamb Gyro Cheesesteak ($11): Roast Peppers & Onions, Provolone & Peppadews. Bread cut too shallow, leaving a dense waste of carbs at bottom. The lamb was flavorful, but hidden between that same bread...I'd pass on this.

And for dessert:

Al's Cheesecake ($6). Very creamy cake, bubbly and light. It was enjoyable, but would fair well with a nice crust for consistency.

Double Chocolate Sundae ($6): Peanut Brittle, Hot Fudge, Cherry & Whipped Cream. Very CREAMY chocolate ice cream, as if it was not even frozen! The brittle baked thin, nutty...a very welcoming addition. Recommended!

To quench the thirst:

Chamomile Breeze ($10) & The Orchard ($10). The former delicate with a fair amount of citrus, the latter a bit sweet with cinnamon and apples, yet finishing with a nice bourbon undertone.

Overall, an excellent choice on the Linq boulevard, more enjoyable than my last few stops in the area.  Would be a great place to catch the game, grab some good food, or a pit stop before/after the Wheel.

The sides were the garlic mashed and the spicy peas. Waited around 25 minutes for the order. When we got the box , it seemed a bit small but on further inspection was rammed to the gills with chicken. The chicken was enough for two meals, including lunch the next day. The sides seemed a bit miniscule though. The mashed potatoes were good but I would not get the peas again. 

Alas the whole shebang was $28.... at our local Churisco place back in the West End we could have got two sides and a whole chicken for $20...might be time to take the bike into little Portugal again ...",2016-08-09 06:26:48

The food is tasty and seems fresh, but as one of the other reviewers mentioned, I, too, will probably order take- out from now on.

My reasons for the unpleasant dine in experience:
1) The music is blaring loud. My friends and I were yelling at each other to overcome the loud music.  We did inform the waitress to turn the music down, which went down like 1/2 a notch and only to go back up again.

2) it was so hot inside!  Not sure if they have no air con or what??  We were sweating!!

When I moved to Shadyside, finding a place to get a decent sandwich within a short walk of my apartment was a key concern.  Sure, there's the Panera on Center, but that's a bit far, and come on, it's a chain.  That's not what Pittsburgh's about.  

Pittsburgh Deli Company is not overly pricy, and they have a pretty good selection of sandwiches that are interesting enough to have me trying a new one each time I go.  Portions are pretty big: I always end up eating half the sandwich now, half of it later.  Quality of food is definitely good enough to keep me coming back.

They're still working on getting their bar together.  I tried to get a Manhattan, but they didn't have what they needed for it.  I tried to get a mojito, same problem.  They mix a pretty good, if a bit small, gin and tonic, though.

Service is good, though the first time I went it took a good minute for my sandwich to be ready.

First we always start with the boiled wontons.  If you haven't tried them, you are in for an outstanding surprise.  We had never eaten them in other restaurants, even LA or SF or NY.  These are causing my mouth to water (as I sit here writing the review!)because they are sooo delicious.  We ask them to not put chiles in ours, but they are still fabulous.

We've had thier noodles, their various soups, various pork dishes.

I probably would give this place a better review, but I'm still annoyed by how unbelievably loud the dining room was because it's across from the Marquee nightclub. My friends and I wanted to chat, but we couldn't without yelling at each other across our table. In the end, the loud music from Marquee gave us all headaches and destroyed our appetites.

We ordered the duck fat fries, the baked smashed potatoes, the asian pork belly buns and a regular hamburger. The duck fat fries were OK; in retrospect not worth the price ($7?) because I could barely taste any difference. The pork belly buns were also just OK; they could have used more pork belly, less buns, and a lot more sauce. They were pretty tasteless considering how thick the buns were. My friend's smashed potatoes were cheesy bacon-y goodness, so no qualms there.

One of my friends also ordered the s'mores drink, which she described as a dressed up mudslide. Is that worth $9-14? I don't think so.",2011-01-16 09:40:12

We arrived around 9pm last night for dinner. One of the servers said please choose any table for 2 only, meaning my friend and I couldn't sit at a table for 4. Which is understandable but there were so many empty tables of 4, empty tables in general so I'm not sure who they were saving it for. It seemed like they tried to squish as many tables as possible on their patio making it super tight and uncomfortable. Once we sat down, we got waters right away and ordered some martinis. I would say the martinis were good value since I think the alcohol was free poured or something lol. 

For our dinner, we ordered the pepperoni and chorizo pizza and the sausage pizza. We also started with Caesar salads. The salad was disappointing, didn't have any bacon or croutons, but I guess it was their take on the salad (had radicchio in it I believe). It wasn't bad but I guess I wanted a classic Caesar salad. My friend was there a few weeks ago and he wanted something he had last time so he asked the server if they changed their menu and she said ""we're always changing our menu"". She wasn't very friendly. I think she was over worked and tired, a little cranky but trying to hold it together lol. My friends pepperoni pizza was good, mine was lacking something. Just didn't have a lot of flavour. It was just salty meat. Also they put cilantro instead of basil on top. Guess they ran out. 

We decided to grab another drink but felt pressured because the waitress was turning people away because they were closed (it was only 10pm). I guess King St. shuts down early. With 2 drinks each, 2 pizzas and salads, the bill was about $108 before tip. 

I think next time I'll try something else on King. Service wasn't the best, and food was decent but lacking something. Overall an okay experience.",2016-08-07 22:29:59

The first thing I noticed about the place was how beautifully designed it was, it's got a high ceiling with a big screen that plays concerts (Eagles), movies (Avatar) and sports (Superbowl, Basketball). It wasn't long before we got to know the owner and found out that he designed portions of the famous Caesar's Palace at the strip. He took it upon himself to build a stage at the restaurant that now has a grand piano for musicians to play. There's an ambiance to Go Wild that I couldn't find in Ichiza or RA, I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's made me love the place ever since. 

On January 29th, my family reserved a table for 7 to celebrate my mom's birthday. When we got there, we were led to this huge booth especially prepared for us :D Since it was a special occasion, we decided to be adventurous and order something out of the ordinary. 

Here's a partial list of what we ordered:
- Fire Go Wild Rolls
- Screaming Orgasm
- Sea Urchin Rolls
- YakiSoba
- Tempura DonBuri
- California Rolls
- Potstickers
- Crunchy Crab Roll (there was a name to it, I forgot. Woops)

When the Fire Go Wild Rolls were served in a flaming fire-lit plate, I swear everyone was so in awe that we simultaneously started taking pictures of it XDD Everything was excellent, not to mention they've got a 'half-price on all sushi' promotion right now, so there's more reason to try it out!

Extra information:

* Open late
* Patio in the back for Korean BBQ
* Serves lunch & dinner

Oh Geul Bo Geul is a Korean restaurant that is somewhat hard to notice even with their bright yellow store front sign. And don't even get me started with the name of the restaurant, even I have difficulty saying it sometimes let alone telling my non-Korean friends about this place.

But all jokes aside, Oh Geul Bo Geul (let's call it OGBG for short) serves home style Korean food and they do it well. Don't get intimidated with the length of their never-ending menu, just take time to read it and be thankful that it comes with color photos.


I've been to OGBG 3 times so far and tried different items everytime. Last time I went I had Korean BBQ in their back patio and didn't take any photos but I will combine photos from my first 2 visits and do a post here.

Once you walk in, it's all Ajumma's (older Asian ladies) working at this restaurant. There is no fancy chandliers here nor skanky girls in tight black dress, it is def laid back and feels as if you are going to a friend's house for a home cooked meal.


Ordered: Porkbelly BBQ (Sam Kyup Sal)

* Pork belly BBQ served with mushrooms, onions and veggies for wrapping
* You cook this on a BBQ grill at your table
* Served with green onions and you can add it to your 'ssam'

Green onions with chili powder and some vinegar for you to eat with the grilled meat

Ordered: Marinated Beef (Ju Mul Luk)

* Beef mixed with veggies in a sweet sauce
* I much prefer this over Bulgogi which I find it to be too sweet
* This you also cook at your table with the grill

Ordered: Kimchi Stew (KimChi JjiGae)

* It was interesting to see vermicelli in a Kimchi stew
* The soup was just spicy enough and not too sour
* Usually you eat this with a bowl of rice

Ordered: Dumplings (Mandoo)

* These were Mul-Mandoo which means it is cooked in boiling water
* You dip this into soy sauce

Ordered: Spicy Soup (Jjam Ppong Tang)

* This is usually a noodle dish but this specific one was made without for drinking
* It makes a nice dish to order when you are drinking soju
* Filled with seafood and veggies

Ordered: Seafood Pancake (Hae Mul Pa Jeon)

* There wasn't much seafood in the pancake
* I didn't really enjoy this

Ordered: Spicy octopus & pork

* This is a table top cooking with veggies, octopus and pork
* You can adjust the spiciness of this dish
* Usually comes in 2 portions but we added an extra serving
* Because there was so much food it did take a while to cook


Conclusion: Now that I've been back 3 times and tried couple things off their menu, I am convinced that even from their never-ending menu- they serve good Korean food. It's nothing fancy but who cares when you can leave with your belly full and happy? If you like Korean BBQ, make sure to drop by and try their backyard patio which has TV and is undercover.",2013-06-25 02:32:24

My only critique would be the signage. It needs to be a little bit bigger because we had to take a couple Uturns to finally find the location of the restaurant. 
When you first get in at the restaurant, you have to order at the counter. Its not a place where you sit down and order when the waiter comes. 
I ordered the corn beef hash which was absolutely delicious. My bf ordered the fried chicken which was really good too. I also tried their macadamia nut coffee. It had great flavor!!!  You can taste bits of macadamia in it. You can tell their products are quality. Definitely going back to try other dishes. :)",2015-09-14 01:36:16

Although I enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant with the open kitchen taking centre stage, I can't help but raise an eyebrow to their tacky tablecloths and chairs.  

The servers are all relatively young. The nice thing is that La Palette is not too hard on your wallet with its Prix Fixe menu ringing in at $33.  All items on the menu marked with a star are available on the PF menu.

We ordered the Escargot, Roasted Red Pepper Soup and Pàté de Compagne to start. The escargot was not prepared in it's traditional drenched in butter fashion and was served atop a bed of spinach topped with croutons. It was disappointing and rather bland. The pâté was quite yummy though it came with no crackers or even a slice of bread until we asked for our bread basket to be replenished. 

For mains we ordered duck confit, soufflé and steak frites. The duck confit was rather tender and flavourful though the skin was lacking crispness. It was served atop a bed of a corn & peas spaëtzle mixture.  

The soufflé was a ricotta soufflé served with ratatouille and a side salad. The soufflé was creamy but the outer layer wS too sponge-y for me. The ratatouille was rather flavorless and the side salad was nothing special. 

The steak was rather disappointing as it was 1) cold 2) tough and 3) a tiny piece of steak. I will vouch though that it was seared to a perfect medium rare and I will also vouch for their yummy yummy frites!  One of the best frites I've had!

Desserts consisted of crême brûlée, clafouti, flourless almond and chocolate cake, and a lemon tart.

The crême brûlée was so small the spoon barely fit. The lemon tart was too sour. The flourless cake was dry as a dessert and the clafouti was meh.

How excited??? I was so excited I skipped eating anything on my break at work just so I could drop in for lunch earlier today. That is pretty rare for me.  Sadly when I came by around noon, they still had boxes on the floor and two staff were still doing prep work getting work done prior to the soft opening this evening. I was somewhat bummed out, but made plans to meet up with friends later in the evening to try this newest restaurant to open in Las Vegas.

First of all for any one not familiar with this area, I just have to let you all know that parking will be a struggle unless the parking god just happened to smile up at you from the asphalt.  So be patient and alert when trying to score a decent parking space.

That out of the way, Udon Monzo just opened for their first day of soft opening this evening, and the restaurant was already at 90% capacity. Definitely off to a fantastic start.

The food we ordered on average were quit good. The menu offerings also has a good selection of Udon dishes to try that a hardcore foodie could come back here twice a day and still not run of new things to try for at least 2 weeks.

The Uni Cream Udon was my favorite thus far. On my first visit, I opted for the regular version, but an even more Uni ""Extra Uni-Style"" upgraded version could also be ordered for a $5 upgrade fee. I think that would be worth it for fans of U N I.

The Bacon Carbonara Udon was good, but I prefer it to be creamier. The Curry version could have a slightly more pronounced Curry flavor.

Kakuni Pork Belly (豚角煮) Braised Pork with Sweet Soy Based Sauce was good. Not as good as my ex-roommate's recipe, but you also don't have to fuss over the stove as you slowly braise it for 1/2 a day.

That is just a very small part of their menu that I have tried today, but still totally looking forward to coming back again tomorrow for a second round.  So many items and not enough time loop to try them all.",2016-12-23 08:23:14

Food flavor and quality-always was and will be 5 star. It's incredible and I crave it.

Quantity of food-5 star. You get tons of food. I usually get two meals out of one order that I take to go.

Parking-BLOWS. 1 star. Barely ever any room. You're better off parking on that side street.

Atmosphere/building- 2 stars. Cramped, tiny. They really need to expand and fast.

She came back 5 min later with a menu. I told her I already know what I wanted-she was already at a table next to me saying ""yes, they were first"". I'm aware, hence the reason they're at a table.

I was furious by the time I left. I couldn't be courteous anymore.

The restaurant is larger than expected with some booths, regular tables and high tables. Many large screen TVs - a sports bar theme/good for groups. My first thought was how uncomfortable the booth seat was - why doesn't the seat cushion extend to the back? ie when I lie back there is a few inches gap of wood? Anyways, moving on - the food was better than expected! 

Between 3 people we shared 5 lbs of seafood (clams, mussels, shrimp priced $11-13~/lb) You can choose the type of seafood, type of sauce, spice level, and any additions (we added corn each at $1 each, not the 'chewy' type of corn I usually eat). My favorite was the clams in garlic butter!! (which I was most hesitant because I was worried the clams would be tiny, but ended up being decent size and fresh, and very flavourful garlic butter sauce). Mussels & shrimp good size as well, and everything was fresh. The sauces were not overly salty (as I had heard about for other boil bars) and complemented the seafood well. Good Catch Blend & Cajun were quite similar, ordered at medium spice level but was not spicy; lemon pepper good too. 

We also ordered Cajun Fries - good fries but could use more seasoning, not very cajun/spicy.

I've tried the big 3 in Toronto, so it's time to take it down a notch. I've known Raijin for a bit now, but never had the chance to try it since I heard mixed reviews from my friends. Out of pure coincidence, I was by the area today and decided to give it a shot.

This place is great if you don't wanna wait for a table a la big 3. The interior space is huge and goes deep in the restaurant; when I arrived at 12:30 the place was only about 3/4 full. Unfortunately that's about it in terms of reasons I would not hesitate in going back.

Service started very good, as the waitress took my order rather quickly. However, by the time I finished my food I couldn't find anyone for a good 15 minutes, to the point I wanted to just leave my money and leave.

As for the food, I ordered the miso tonkotsu ramen in a small bowl, as I wasn't hugely hungry. The cha siu was pretty good, not Kinton standards but better than Sansotei's at least. The ramen was actually very similar to Kinton's, which is okay but I do prefer Sansotei's. However, the broth was the big loser in my bowl, as it was simply too salty for my liking (and I'm pretty tolerant when it comes to rich broth, case and point Santouka). 

Considering the fact I accept this place isn't as good as the big 3, my experience here was overall decent. The ramen is passable, with improvements that can be made with the broth being too salty. I definitely wasn't expecting Kinton-level service, and the level I got was decent, but of course it would've been better if I had been attended consistently.",2013-11-17 05:35:35

The salsa trio + queso appetizer... one of the salsas (arbol tomatillo) had no taste whatsoever. Like slightly sweet water?... The red, classic salsa was OK-- hard to mess up a plain tomato-based salsa. The queso--SICK. Was like tasteless, cheap yogurt. It didn't even have the consistency of cheese, much less the flavor. It had NO flavor.

The King Neptune's platter-- lots of seafood, and then southern fried veggies. The shrimp and scallops were obviously frozen, not fresh. They were tiny-- the smallest I'd ever seed. The fish pieces were better, but there were only 3 small bites of fish. The veggies, which I was most excited about, were flavorless and burnt. No flavor left in them at all-- it was hard to even distinguish what they were. The tartar sauce?--must be made out of the same bland yogurt as the queso-- looked and tasted the same.

Banana pudding may have taken the top spot for WORST. It was literally brown, mushy bananas and box-made pudding. No vanilla wafters, no sort of biscuit or cake... Just a slop of processed pudding and old banana slices mixed in-- was probably made 5 days ago and just congealed.

Since this was my first time here, I worried it would be more of a bar than a pub. This *is* Vegas, and alcohol abuse is an issue (the reason I avoid bars here). Despite their amply stocked bar, they seem to have strict rules, so the atmosphere was pleasant and relaxed.

What better way to celebrate futbol than with a bunch of hooligans drinking outside?  I was starving so we lapped up our share of $3 cans while waiting an hour for a table.  The host staff wasn't the most delightful, but it was slammed, so I didn't care.  After we were seated I [bravely] chose the grilled buffalo chicken salad.  I thought it would be mediocre but hey, #weddingwaistline.  What I received was a feast of epic salad proportions.  It was HUGE and that's saying a lot coming from me, a well-known bottomless salad eater.  First, having the choice of grilled chicken on something like a buffalo salad is rare and much welcomed.

We're always up for trying new restaurants!  There were 5 of us total and we tried the brussels sprouts appetizer as well as the pretzel with amber ale fondue to start.  The brussels sprouts were surprisingly good, cooked with a little bit of bacon (which makes almost anything better).  The pretzel itself was ok - nothing too exciting.  The fondue was too much beer, not enough cheese.  Stick with cheese fondue for pretzels, people!

Entrees...  I had the french dip.  Others had the chicken caprese sandwich and fish and chips.  All were decent.  I do not like the dip for the french dip.  It has rosemary in it and it just tasted like an herb juice, which I did not enjoy.  The sandwich itself was quite tasty.  The fish and chips were decent, perhaps a bit too much breading.  The chicken caprese sandwich was very good.

Now for the best part - dessert!  Where the dip for the pretzels tasted like beer, the black butte brownie is not overpowered by beer.  It was delicious!  The blackberry cobbler was also very tasty but oh so mushy.

Other notes:  Our server was great - very friendly, made great recommendations, and kept our beverages full.  They make their own lemonade here and it was pretty good.

The parking lot was packed, so I was expecting a long wait, but we were seated right away.  Upon entering, we were greeted by a delicious looking dessert case with huge cakes and cookies.  None of  us had room to try any, so I can't say how good they actually taste.  One confusing thing I noticed when we walked in was that there were 3 boards scattered around that all sort of listed the daily specials, but none of them said the same thing.  

I had a veggie pita with fries and a side of coleslaw, and my husband and friend both had burgers.  The pita was packed with probably close to a lb of spinach.  The fries were good, and I liked having the condiments and napikins at the table.  The coleslaw was an add-on, and something I wouldn't order again.  The slaw had good flavor, but was too soupy.  Also, the portion was HUGE.  Way too much slaw for one person to enjoy eating, and this is from someone who loves coleslaw.  The guys said their burgers were good, but not spectacular.  They did look quite large.  Onion rings were above average.  I saw many other tables getting pizza, which looked really good.

I would have given a 4 for the food alone, but the overall experience was definitely no better than 3.  For one, our waitress was not very nice.  She seemed like she was in a really bad mood, and was not at all helpful when I asked about what types of drinks they have.  As a side note, they don't list any of the non-alcoholic beverages anywhere on the menu, which is super annoying.  Another odd thing was that our first round of drinks (2 waters and a coke) all had a weird taste.   We sent them back and the refills were fine, but then our later refills were weird tasting again.  I don't know what was going on with that.  And my last complaint is the bathroom layout.  You pretty much have to walk into the kitchen to get to the bathrooms, which wouldn't have been as big of a deal if all the servers didn't glare at me every time I was passing through.",2013-01-04 13:52:55

Let me start off by saying that I love pizza. If I could eat pizza everyday, I would! I'm normally not a huge fan of thin crust but we ordered a large pepperoni, ricotta and sausage pizza and it was great. My only issue was that there was too much ricotta, so every bite we took had a nice hunk of ricotta but I shouldn't be complaining... Fresh ingredients, super hot, had a nice crunch to it and it was huge! 

We also ordered the large House salad (I think) and a small plate of antipasta. We had about half of the pizza left to take home. Great quality for a really decent price. 

Our server was very nice and came back frequently to check on us. some people were dressed casually (like my friends and I in gym clothes) or dressed up. There was a couple next to use that seemed to be on their first date and another table with two ladies enjoying wine.

It hasn't changed much since it was Billy's BBQ before.  I got a 1/2 pound of brisket.  The brisket was tender and seasoned well.  But here are the negatives.  I grew up on Texas BBQ and one Cardinal Sin is that you DO NOT sauce the brisket.  Sauce is served on the side and optional for those who want it.  While the sauce was just drizzled on the meat, it still was wrong.  And the sauce they served on the side was not good at all.  I tossed it and used my own sauce at the house.  I also wanted potato salad, but they make it with onions, which I still have problems comprehending why people would do this?!  All you can taste is the onions, and not the potatoes!   I'm glad I asked though, because I was informed that they garnish the brisket with chives, too?!  What the... ?!   Most of my favorite places in Texas have plenty of onions, pickles and peppers for those who want to add that to your meal, there is no need to take anything away from the meat, if your meat is good... and theirs is!   Since the potato salad had onions, I opted for the mac & cheese.  It was ok.  Didn't have much flavor and it looked like it had big pepper flakes scattered in it.  It's nothing I would get again.  I would definitely get the brisket here again, but tell them no sauce or chives next time.  It, along with the staff, service and cleanliness is why I'm giving it three stars.",2018-03-25 23:44:09

I attempted many times to get a coffee only to find a locked door and darkness... I should mention this was on weekdays, midday. It got to the point where I was actually convinced it might have been a front for something else.

Fast-forward two years and Cool Hand seems to have switched it's erratic hours for conventional cafe operation. There are lots of good vegetarian and vegan options at this omni-cafe. 

My sister ordered an avocado, cheddar and chutney sandwich that was quite good. It wasn't exactly toasted but it wasn't entirely cold either. It was devoured quickly and she was left wondering why it was so small. I had her side of vegan lentil soup, which all came to a grand total of $11. That's not cheap for such small portions. And this comes from two tiny people regularly eat small meals.

I really struggled with whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars. It is definitely overrated on some fronts, but sticks out in a neighbourhood that is steady on the tracks to full on trendiness(get it, cuz it's called the Junction?).

I would go back even though my sister chose to regale me with a story  of seeing the owner come out of the washroom and sneeze directly into both hands, wipe on a towel and go back to work without washing on her previous visit.

The Yellow Curry with Soy Chicken, which came with rice, was very flavorful and had exactly the right amount of spice for a curry dish.  The portion was good and they were not skimpy with the vegan chicken. It was a very filling dish and I had enough for 2 days. 

On the second visit, I ordered the Grand Tempura.  This dish is an appetizer, but was large enough to be a meal for me. It came with tempura battered vegan chicken, vegan shrimp, and assorted vegetables. I spotted broccoli, red bell peppers, onions, and sweet potatoes amongst my veggie variety.   The tempura dish came with a delicious sweet chili dipping sauce.  The problem is that they only give you one sauce, all of which you'll sop up 1/2 way through this dish.  An extra sauce is $2. TWO dollars for a 0.25-0.50 cent cup of sauce.  Outrageous. The dish should come with 2 sauces already, based on its size.

It was always magical for me: ""... Willing to March into Hell for a Heavenly cause..."" is one of the more dramatic lines.

This revival changes the venue from the 1600 Spanish Inquisition, to the 1960s. They use instead Generalissimo Franco's re-election, the violent surrounding it and the roundup of many Spanish citizens for little to no reason as the central backdrop.  It's a play, inside a play btw.

The cast was great and the salsa dancing during the play was incredible. The play started this past Friday 1/12 night and runs for several weeks.  We bought our row 6 seats online at Goldstar for a discount.

The chicken is prepared on a grill (for those of you familiar with Pollo Tropical in Miami...its something like it). However they manage to develop and 'heat' up the flavour quite a bit. The sides are filling, but the chicken is the star. This is great 'grilled' chicken with full taste and great heat. 

If I feel like fried chicken..its definitely Popeye's but from now on the Swiss Chalet has been consigned to the dust bin of history, at least for me. What an upgrade from that!

It's called ""Go Wild"" now and they are offering the 50% off sushi rolls 24/7.  Before you get too excited, I gotta say the rushi rolls on the 50% off menu are about $3-5 over priced compare to other places.  So your  50% off is probably equivalent to 30% off, however, still a pretty good deal.  

The inside is a much bigger and fancier than it looks from the outside,  although I rarely see more than 3 tables occupied.  Because they don't have all-you-can-eat I've only ordered the special sushi rolls.  I liked everything, especially the Great White Shark roll and the Kiss of Fire roll, both spicy rolls.  The best thing about this place is that the rice on the rushi rolls is sooooo thin.  I guess that's a clever strategy by the chef to make you order more food.

Seafood Pho = Just okay as I wasn't much of a fan for the broth. The actual seafood was fine but overall I probably wouldn't order pho from here again.

Broken Rice Plate (Grilled Pork) = Food was great but it was quite pricey considering how close this restaurant is to the university.

Chicken With Broccoli (Lunch Special) = First item I tried from the Chinese menu and it was not bad at all, not to mention great value for lunch time.

We usually go to Hooter's between clubs since we get so hungry and/or drunk at the first club that we need some sustenance to soak up the alcohol in order to keep partying.  When you're that intoxicated and hungry, anything tastes good, but now that I'm sober and just chillin' on my couch thinking about the food, it actually really sucks.  It's totally sub-par, too salty, and too greasy.  

The restaurant itself is decorated kinda nice but the place is dirty.  The booths usually have an abundance of crumbs and food in the buttons.  And even at 3am, there's usually a wait for a table, since everyone else is there for 25 cent wings.  The people there are pretty ghetto and you'll see a lot of girls in there without shoes on or practically passed out at their table.  The service is hit or miss.

Simple menu of 3-oz sliders with some more unusual  meat choices in addition to beef  (ostrich, buffalo, lamb, salmon...), salads, sides, and a few desserts.  I was surprised to find a full bar.  Layout is like a contemporary diner with the bar taking the place of a counter.

I tried the turkey burger which was actually a little dry, but with grilled pineapple and fresh guacamole, I really didn't notice.  I found one to be enough with a side dish.  My husband had an ostrich slider and a kobe beef slider-he liked them both.  Selection of toppings is huge.  We also had red potato salad which was okay and sweet potato fries which were excellent.  We tried the key lime stack for dessert.  Not really pie, not really cake, sort of like a layered cheese cake, not bad but a little disappointing.

Service was excellent.  We ordered chipotle aioli but received ketchup by mistake.  To compensate, our server brought a platter with a sampling of all their aiolis.  Very nice gesture.  The manager also stopped by our table to make sure everything was to our liking and to thank us for coming in.

The only thing that may turn some people off is they bring the dishes as they are ready-so salad came out first, fries next, burgers last.  I enjoyed the little courses, but if you have to have the fries with the burger, ask.  Otherwise, you'll have a lonely little burger on your hands.

First things first here is a little list of items that you should bring to help you on your Gilcrease journey.

A bag or backpack to carry all your fruit and veggies in. They offer plastic bags too. If you don't have your own. 

Gloves to aide you in picking veggies and fruit.

Clippers to help you clip the veggies and fruit. 

Water. They do sell it, but not till the end when you check out. 

We got there around 9am. Gilcrease opens at 7am. The earlier you get there the better. The later you go the more people there are and parking becomes an issue. 

They have signs that point you in the direction of things on the farm. Jessie and I knew we wanted the apple cider donuts first. So we headed over to the covered area where they were selling them. I was excited cause they were also selling pear cider. It was great that they had benches to sit and eat at. Yum! The little apple cider donuts were still warm and not to surgery. They topped them with pumpkin cream cheese too. It complimented the donuts perfectly. That pear cider! Omg so refreshing! I think it's better then the apple cider that they sell too. While we were finishing our donuts we noticed a tractor that was picking people up just outside of where they sold the donuts. It's totally free to ride the tractor and they drop you off at different picking spots along the way. This is a great thing cause Gilcrease is huge! 

Our first stop was the green apples. The workers on the tractor ride told us to check out row 8 and we'd find good apples. Which we did! How fun! Next we stopped at the veggie patch where we picked grape tomatoes, zucchini and butternut squash. By this time it was getting HOT! So we passed up the pumpkins and hitched a ride back on the tractor to the front of the farm. On our way back we got to see the little owl sanctuary they have in the back of the farm. We also saw a road runner. (Please if you have kids and you see a road runner at the farm please do not let your child chase the animals. It's not funny.)

At the front of the farm you stand in line and pay for what you picked and you also have the chance to buy peanut butter, honey and fresh garlic. 

Gilcrease is awesome! What a find in the middle of the Vegas desert. It's a fun time for everyone. I can't wait to go back when it's not so hot!! Another great find with Jessie B!",2014-10-14 02:54:15

Sandwich had roasted chicken that was rubbery and the bread didn't taste like anything. Side salad, tomatoes way too ripe, should have been thrown out not served and croutons were soggy. The tea was thick tasting, like there was too much tea and not enough water. The rugelach was actually decent, crispy and sweet.

Food was a typical chain stuff, well balanced between price, quality and other economic factors. It is not supposed to impress or pleasure your gourmet qualities.

When you walk in the front doors, you are greeted by lots of rustic wood and an old world feel.  You walk into the bar room first and then you realize just how big and spacious and long this place is.  What seemed small and cramped from the outside was huge on the inside.   I love the low lighting and the cozy fireplace.  It felt like an authentic Irish Pub.

One thing I found odd was that we had to figure out where the hostess stand was.  It was actually all the way through the bar on the other side...just before you enter the dining room.

The menu was somewhat limited, but the things they had on the menu covered all the basis of tastes.  They had everything from a ground ribeye burger, to a shepherds pie, to fish and chips, to nice salads, to grilled cheese.

2 at my table got the fish and chips with little green peas.  Although I don't eat fish, If I did....I would have torn into the dish because it looked great.  The peas were tender and green....almost like they were steamed and not boiled.....almost al dente looking....which is the way I would want them.  I was torn between the burger and the shepherds pie.  Ended up getting the burger with some Brussels Sprouts.  The burger was pretty dang good....not the best I have ever had...but it was good.  The only thing I hate is how everyone is starting to serve food on slabs of wood.  Just use plates.    The Brussels Sprouts were delish!  Perfectly seasoned, browned just right, and just oiled enough.   This is the epitome of how I try to make mine at home.

While we were there, I went to the back patio to check it out.  I was shocked at the size of the space!  Huge bar.....lots of seating for eating and drinking.    Quite impressive.

All in all,  the food was good and the  atmosphere was even better.  I think the most impressive thing about this place was the sheer size and decor of the place.

My Aunt is a ""foodie"" and goes around the world scouting places she likes and when any of us (family) are visiting, or living, in a city or town or country even, she scouts out places that we will like. 

My Aunt told me about a year ago to go to this restaurant was ""known"" for the best grilled cheese-perhaps it was true or not, it was not on the menu for kids it was just a grilled cheese with bacon on the adult menu. 

I was spending a nice day with my kids as we are leaving in two weeks for the summer and I went to Primm (guilty pleasure-Powerball) and then the Outlet Mall to get them some more clothes for the summer. I tried to make a day of it as it is roasting out (which is why we leave) so I decided to take them to Honey Salt as they did not want to eat in Primm. 

It is a half hour north of where we live and we arrived and it is in a very upscale shopping area and looked really promising. I was very excited as my son is a poor eater and I prayed he'd eat a grilled cheese-but alas there was only the grilled cheese with bacon, which he would not have eaten, but I am sure they would have made just cheese, however, he wanted French Toast-which was big enough for the kids to share. It was probably amazing as he is very picky and gobbled it up, my ""good eater"" daughter did not really touch hers. 

The atmosphere for a trendy upscale restaurant was pretty loud and as soon as we walked in I did not feel it was really going to be kid friendly. As we entered a woman, with a child, told me to be careful there was glass behind her (prelude to our finale). We were seated at the very corner near the kitchen and our very nice and friendly waitress and other staff came over several times to tend to us (service was excellent). 

So, the meat, literally and figuratively, of my review is my own meal. I had a Steak and Eggs and substituted the potatoes for a Ceasar Salad. The salad was very good, albeit quite small, and my food was pretty unappetising. I say this because it was cold. The steak was cold, the eggs were cold and very hard/rubbery. I did not want to send it back as it was warm enough to eat and so I just ate it. 

I will reiterate that the staff was generally, well all really, quite nice and very attentive. Unfortunately at the end of our meal my 2 year old daughter was running on the booth as I was trying to pay and broke a glass. Anyone who has a two year old, or has had children knows it is very hard to control them at 2 years old. I also saw no need for them to have chunky water glasses at every table, obviously, as was the case when we entered, my child was not the first to break a glass. She broke a glass and both a woman, who I believe was the manager (as a friend of mind knows the owner Elizabeth and said she is in Vancouver right now), as well as a really nice staff member who was cleaning it as I apologised came rushing over. 

The woman did not speak to me as I profusely apologised, though the man cleaning was very nice and said, ""Don't worry"". The woman seemed very annoyed and I tried to get the bill settled as soon as possible and was trying to keep my son out of the glass, when my daughter jumped and fell off the booth. The gentleman picked her up and she was crying and I had to hold her while I signed as quickly as possible so as to be able to just leave. 

I totally understand that it is unfortunate for kids to break things, and in some ways is a parental responsibility, but the review is not even based on this nor the way the woman who came over seemed utterly annoyed with us, it was about the atmosphere and the meal. Just ""trendy"" in an L.A. way where you have a quasi cafe/restaurant with lots of people socialising and talking very loud and waitstaff who are super busy and yet very attentive and food that is not really worth it. I truly hate giving anything but stellar reviews but sometimes you just have to be honest. I felt horrible but I did not need to be made to feel worse by the woman who came over to the table, it actually stressed me and I was trying too hard to get the kids out of there fast enough.",2018-06-10 01:29:56

If your warranty company tells you they are sending this company out to do repairs then you might want to call someone else to do the job. My warranty company sent these jokers out when my water heater was leaking. It took them 3 days to finally get them to come out. It was even put in as an emergency and when the service tech finally came out he tried to say that my platform where the water heater was on was damaged and that my insurance company would have to look at it before they could do any work. He then hands me a business card of one of their side companies that this company works with. I told him that we have been without water for going on the third day which he seemed to not care. I told him that all I care about is getting this water heater replaced so my family won't have to suffer anymore. He said he would have to call my warranty company for approval. So he says he won't be able to start service on the water heater till the next day because he would have to go to some warehouse to pick up the water heater. Another excuse  because he didn't want to do the job in the first place. I told him ok just let me know and he leaves. An hour later my warranty company I'm on the phone with letting them know about this company and they tell me it is going to be $566 in addition. I told my warranty company I could buy a brand new water heater and have it installed for that much so what good is the warranty. All I needed was the tank and nothing else. So after reviewing the itemized list of items that they were going to overcharge me. None of it added up to the $566 they added on and none of the parts did I need to properly install a water heater. After all the b.s. this company fed me and the warranty company  I decided to do the work myself and hire someone else to help me. Shame on you Ideal Services!!

Thank you for providing us with late night dim sum!

For a midnight snack or after a night of clubbing, you are always open.

What would late night dim sum be like without:
*Being able to watch a drunken fist fight
*A homeless dude passing though leaving one of those please-give-me-money-smiley-face cards at your table

Even though I know you don't make your dim sum fresh, it tastes pretty decent, especially the spicy squid.

Sure, I've had tastier.
Sure, you don't have the most exciting menu
Sure, the clientele is questionable at times.

But that's okay!

You are still awesome.  Thank you again for always being there throughout the years.  I wonder what you look like during the day time!

Go early on the weekends if you want to have lunch... get there by Noon otherwise there's a HUGE line for the grill.

Lots of yummy choices on the grill.... sandwiches and plates...

Here's the link to their menu (picnic style): 
http://johnmullsmeats.com/image/data/pdfs/John%20Mull's%20Road%20Kill%20Grill%20Menu%2008-15-12.pdf

Plan on outdoor eating... they have some tables under shade... some are not.  So, it's wise to wear a hat, sunglasses and sunscreen.  

Their area is gravel/dirt so dress appropriately.
They have 2 parking areas on either side of their grill area.

The Meat Market/Butcher Shop is AWESOME!  
You can get all kinds of different meats and cuts.  You can specify the thickness of the cuts you order too.  And if you order over $50 ... you get a FREE flat of farm fresh eggs.  (Did you know a flat of eggs is 24?!)  We didn't realize we were getting this and we were unprepared for it.  Oh well... got home safe with all eggs in tact. 

For lunch I ordered the Brisket Sandwich.... it's brisket on a roll.  I should re-phrase..... LOTS of brisket on a roll.  I took 1/2 home.  The meat is super moist and tender and flavorful.  Not salty tasting.  

I also got a side of mac salad.  It's pretty good.  It was made with the little round macaroni pasta noodles.... not the elbow ones.... it was a little mayo-y and sweet for me.  I prefer the kind that has some mustard flavor to it.  But still this one was solid not store bought.

The husband got the 2 plate meat... it came with 2 sides... he got brisket and hot links with cole slaw and potato salad.  The cole slaw was a bit runny and I didn't care for it.  I like cole slaw that is crisp and crunchy and I think because they have to pre-make so much of it that it sits in the dressing too long.  The potato salad was Really Good..... Get the Potato Salad.  :)  The Hot Links had a bit of ""hotness"" to it but not super spicy/hot.... they had good texture and great flavor.  I think these would make a Great Hot Dog.  :) 

We will totally be back.  :)

Came to the Downtown location for lunch - go early or late because it is small and gets crowded. Ordered the CHICKEN plate, fried, with 2 sides- the grits and red beans & rice.  Uh - so full just thinking bout it but I wanted to try my favorite things. 

The fried CHICKEN was cooked great but the meat itself needed some seasoning. Waitress offered the house hot sauce which I adventurously accepted (I love hot sauce) but this was toooo spicy - even for me. And I didn't love the flavor of it. And it cost an extra .50cents (I'm not cheap it's just the principle, I wouldn't of cared at all if I really liked it ;).

So the RED beans & RICE were yummy! But the Gouda GRITS are ""da bizness"" and I can't wait to have them again! Note: both of these Sides have an ""upcharge"" which is noted on the menu for the grits but the not the RB&R.

""Back home"" we are blessed with the most amazing bbq of Rudy's. A friend of mine from Tennessee, who has lived in Phoenix now for about 4 years, introduced me to Kinfolk's and I was pleased. Everything that the 5 star reviews say is true of this place. The portions are huge, the prices are decent and whether you like the brisket or the pulled pork (sorry, never tried the ribs), this bbq is the best I've had in Arizona. If I had written a review for this place just a week ago, I would probably have given it 4 stars.

After my second attempt to take my girlfriend here and not getting to eat, we will not be going back. I was always impressed with the older guy running the place, pretty much solo, other than the cooking. He takes your order, he brings you out the food and he rings you up. The problem I've always had is his grumpiness. Well, on Saturday he went a little too far. When we arrived at 7:45 p.m. and saw the closing time on the door, I wasn't particularly certain what it read. Plus I was craving some Kinfolk's. We went inside and there were still a lot of people eating so I thought we were safe. When I began pouring my own drink (as you do), the older man told me they were about to close and that it ""better"" be to go. I apologized for coming in so close to closing time but explained that it looked like the 8 on the door was scratched to look like a 9 OR that the 9 looked like it was filled in with liquid paper to look like an 8. Either way, I wasn't sure but I was hopeful. He then began to argue with me. He was totally out of line. He could've politely told me that they were about to close and that I could get something to go and I would've been happy. Instead he chose to be a shithead and in turn, drive me to go to a chain bbq restaurant (Famous Dave's, not too bad plus they serve beer). I've since sought out another decent place in Dickey's BBQ, off Shea in Scottsdale.

Sadly, Kinfolk's is still the best bbq I've had here in the Phoenix area. I will not, however, give my hard earned money in this tough economy to a grumpy, broken body, old man that cannot be bothered to be polite. Good luck keeping your small business going during this recession when people like myself are being more choosy about where to spend our money.",2009-06-08 22:36:12

When I couldn't find it I found an employee to give me a hand.  She did the usual stuff by double checking the section it was in and looking in a few other spots it might be hidden in like staff picks.  Usually at this point the employee will just tell me sorry, try one of the other stores listed in the computer.

First and foremost I may say Paymon's has an excellent happy hour. The service is usually terrible in the lounge area but we deal with it because it's a pretty awesome atmosphere. Being huge fans of Hookah and living in Summerlin, this location is usually our go to spot when we don't want to drive all the way down to The Olive Hookah Lounge. Food wise, the hummus and the stuffed grape leaves are awesome! The fries are so good that I have to talk myself out of getting them most of the time haha. Hookah wise we love the peach flavor.

Now for last night...  We came in with a few friends and I was wearing a Chargers baseball cap. The waitress (after taking our drink orders) told me I was not allowed to wear a hat. Now the very last time we came in I was wearing  the exact same hat. Very confused I asked her what the issue was. She said there were no hats allowed in the restaurant / lounge.

Let's start with the Fireside Lounge. This is one of my favorite places in Vegas. I've loved it since I first visited Vegas years and years ago. It's one of the first places that springs to mind when I think of ""old Vegas"". This little tucked away lounge is both classy and neon. It's both laid-back and fun. I can just picture any classic Vegas star sitting on a couch here.

The Fireside Lounge is pretty small. When you walk into the Peppermill, you'll see a small glass door off to your left labeled ""Fireside Lounge"". When you walk through it, you'll see lots of blues, pinks, and greens, bits of neon, mirrors, and plenty of fake plants and trees. But it so works, it feels classy - old Vegas classy.

To your right is a small, low bar with some video poker. To your left is a large indoor fire pit / flaming pool thing. Around the indoor fire pit / flaming pool thing is a huge circle couch. Around the rest of the room are smaller couches and some chairs - in an array of different sizes to accommodate just your size group. And the way it is all laid out, it is not too hard to find a private corner for some snuggling.

On corners around the room are TVs playing all sorts of music videos. Sometimes it 80s hair bands, sometimes it's a live Pearl Jam show. It's different just about every time I go. And it's never too loud. It's just there in the background, providing ambiance and conversation starters.

The best part is that the cocktail waitresses wear long, black evening gowns. It just adds to the whole environment and experience. There's a decent cocktail list and bar snack menu. Don't expect anything inventive here (though, they have been trying some new martinis). It's all classic and old-fashioned (and that is what is going to taste the best here). Think Mai Tai and shrimp cocktail.

Combine all that with it being open-24 hours and you've got a must-do. It can be a romantic spot for couples and a chill spot for a group of guys or gals. And I've seen a few celebrities here too. Not the type that host at Pure, but the type that you might catch performing at The Joint.

And I have to add that the staff at the Fireside are pretty open and willing to accommodate. My husband decided to surprise me with an Elvis impersonator for my birthday, and he set it all up with Fireside for this Elvis to come in and sing to me. So yeah, Fireside is totally a 5 star place.

So on to the Peppermill Restaurant. Sure, there are better 24 hour restaurants in Vegas, but almost none with this kind of atmosphere. And the food is well above average. I can't say I've eaten here a lot, but the handful of times I have, I haven't had any complaints. 

The portions are huge - so don't be afraid to share. My favorite menu items are actually the omelettes. They're huge and flavorful (no going stingy on the cheese and fillers here), and they just really hit the spot after a long night of drinking and gaming. 3.5 stars for the food, but add 1/2 a star for the ambiance.

The Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge are novelty Vegas places not to be missed.",2010-11-30 20:05:35

I went with the 'house special' grilled salmon don which was disappointing to say the least because I could have made the exact same thing at home. The special bbq sauce I've heard a lot about wasn't all that special. I felt there could have been more and that it could have been sweeter. Also, nowhere does it say there would be semi-cooked egg whites in the middle of rice. It didn't enhance the dish like an egg in a bibimbap. But on the positive side, the salmon was also decent itself as it was nicely grilled and the the portion size was quite generous. You will definitely be leaving full after one of these.

Even my 5 yr old son was treated with kindness and smiles - not typical at this caliber of restaurant and it was so appreciated. 

The food was excellent. I especially enjoyed the appetizer of yellow fin tuna cups - so light and a perfect bite to get my taste buds going.  My filet was cooked perfectly and I could have eaten ten of the crab-stuffed tomatoes. The chocolate dessert recommended by the waiter was also divine - and I don't even like sweets or chocolate! A 5-star experience all around.

Usually, the items stay pretty consistent but the past 3 times I went, there were unique items every single time. Sometimes they have fritattas and omelettes. Sometimes there's french toast, pancakes etc. The consistent items include hard boiled eggs, fried eggs, hash browns, bagels/toast, fresh fruit (melon, pineapple, berries), cheese, bacon and sausage. 

I discovered a hack when I went there. The salad bar, beside the hot buffet is technically open in the morning so I load up my box with a bed of spinach, add some eggs on top, add some fruit on the side, sometimes french toast, hash browns and a slice of cheese. The total usually comes to around $5 - 6 which I think is a pretty good deal. If you don't go the salad route, it's very easy to get carried away and end up with a $10 bill. 

Food is fresh and tasty, great breakfast option when you're looking to indulge one day! They also have breakfast sandwiches, fresh packaged fruit, yogurt parfaits and coffee.",2015-09-11 17:32:39

Very disappointed after trying this place for the first time!!!

First, I'll say that the ambiance outside was very nice (minus their inability to control the flies) and the service was impeccable. 

I can't help but think they had a new cook because the food was not very tasty. Here is my breakdown:

Red curry soup-very very bland. no curry flavor. 
Hamachi crisp-my favorite dish. excellent, although i questions whether there was anything other than hamachi, cucumber and red wine vinegar in it
Duck fat potatoes-expensive potato wedges w dill. absolutely no special flavor added bc of the duck fat

Here are the mains:
Rigatoni-holy salt bomb! i like salt on most dishes but this was unbearable. 
scallops-my favorite seafood. These tasted only of salt, the sauce they were on had almost zero flavor and they were TINY scallops. I paid like $20 for 3 tiny salt filled scallops?",2017-07-30 12:53:10

 ""Best car wash in Henderson awesome customer service and great quality. I payed $40 dollars. For a Hand wax that included the wash and all 4 mats shampoo other places charge $40 just for waxing my car...""

Sounded pretty good so I thought I would give it a try today. 
When I arrived with my clean but dusty '97 Ford 150 I was told that it would be $160 for a ""FULL"" detail. So much for the $40 deal I read about. At first I balked at the price, but the detailing attendant ""Danny"" told me it would be worth it and he recommended it. Okay, so he would shampoo the bench seat and the floor carpets, clean the windows inside and out, clean the interior doors and dash, wash and wax the outside and clean up the tires. This is hardly worth $160 but, I was already there and wanted it done. However, when I came back to pay I was charged $175! Do the math and they are getting $58 per hour if it takes them all of 3 hours. I get my 4,000 square foot home cleaned by 2 people for 6 hours for less than that!
I told them no rush because I was not going to wait the estimated 3 hours on premises. It was 8:30AM when I brought the truck in for detailing. When I came back at 2:30PM they said my truck was just finished and they were about to call me.  Since they had taken 6 hours I expected a pretty good job. However,  I noticed that they did not do the inside of my Leer cap or the inside of the truck's bed! They said that was not included in the price! How do you call that a ""FULL"" detail? Since the carwash owner was standing there, they agreed to wipe down the inside of the bed.  Upon opening the door to get in I realized they had poured on some Armour All type sticky, shiny product which coated everything and was glistening. I swiped my hand over the dash and came up with a greasy film! Then I had to ask for it to be wiped off because it would was so excessive that it would attract dust easily. 

Then after getting home I took a closer look. You can see the photos of how they did my tires the same way with the shiny stuff and let it run down in streaks without even properly wiping it down.  What's more, the brake and accelerator pedals were not cleaned at all and were caked with dried mud. All this for a whopping $175 plus tip!? Never again.  I know custom detailers who would give a better price than Moonlight Car Wash and a true ""FULL"" detailing.
UPDATED: The following business day I received a call from the business owner offering me money-saving coupons if I would remove my Yelp review.

Rope in the ceiling seem to emulate the balloon tie lines of the icon.  OH, little side note on the icon of the brewery I overheard in conversation.  The fish you see on the icon is actually a ""queen fish"" to represent the Queen City of Charlotte in some way.

I didn't even know VooDoo Lounge was a steak house/restaurant. I've only been to the lounge itself and experienced the nightclub aspect of it.

Let me say that if you want to meet guys: this is it! lol
Not because it's a club but, because it's a steakhouse. You know, men love their meat!!! No-pun-intended...kinda.
Almost every table had men of 5+ and zero to one girl eating with them. It was strange! 
Although my  table consisted of 4 girls and 1 guy...so, take from that what you will.

I already ate and didn't have much of an appetite so, I ate the beef steak tomato salad. It was good but, come on, $10 for a small to medium plate of tomatoes??! COME ON.
I had a chance to taste my friends' plates and everything was pretty on point. The lamb was yummy! Although I may be biased since it is my all-time favorite entree..everrrrr. And that mac and cheese of theres --- WOW!!! It reminds me alot of Yardhouse's mac and cheese...probably because of the truffle oil in it. SAMPS THAT!!! Definitely.

Other than the view, the best aspect of eating at the restaurant is that you can get into the club without paying. YES, WITHOUT PAYING!!! In Vegas, not paying for entrance to any club is a treasure, pleasure, and all around good time already!!!!!!!!!! Definitely one less thing to pay for. 

It was packed which is expected on a weekend. Good mix of people. Quite a few more young people than I expected. Music was ""ehh"" but, fun is always brought about when you're partying with friends. So, it was a good night =)

Last visit I tried the pizza burger. While the idea was novel, I'd enjoy it more if it used a spicy pepperoni or had a Hawaiian twist to it or something.

No matter. Boogies still rocks my burger world! And vintage video games in the decor never get old either :).",2013-08-17 05:58:32

The description suits this restaurant since it is conveniently located one level above Marquee Nightclub.  If you're a health nut then this place is not for you as most items on the menu are super rich in flavor and sauces and/or grease.  On the most recent trip I had the 10 oz loin steak as entree plus sides of the sweet corn pudding, mushroom pot pie and Parmesan truffle fries.  Appetizers we had were the crispy lobster tails, lil burgers and a tomato caprese salad.  All in all the meal was quite satisfying but definitely a bit overpriced as the bill came out to around $250 for the three of us but I guess the atmosphere makes up for it.  Only issue I have is sometimes the music is too loud and makes it hard to have a conversation while dining.",2016-01-05 21:33:20

Their house wings are made of crack, I'm not sure what is in this sauce, but I would totally buy it if they bottled it.  They have a poblano cream cheese that goes on this insane fire burger-seriously the burger is not for the faint of heart. Heartburn for days. However, the poblano cream cheese left me wanting more. I asked for it to be put on the Rachael instead of 1000 and slaw and it was amazeballs!!!!!

Beer is pretty good, decent selection of low IBU's, which I like. Wish happy hour was a bit more plentiful, but at least they have one.

I was sort of not sure what to expect at all and when the people behind the counter found out it was my first visit there, they let me taste a whole bunch of stuff. I really liked that idea since it gave me a good idea of their flavors and their heat (since they said some dishes were spicy...eh, not so much). 

I wound up ordering the jerk chicken with black beans and the jerk chicken fried rice. The jerk chicken had great flavor (I added their hot sauce to it which made it even better -- it's by the soda machine) and the jerk chicken fried rice wasn't skimping on the chicken. The black beans were probably my favourite part. They are just a little sweet and just a little spicy. They were excellent. I think next time I will try one of the cheese crisps or just get a tortilla to sop up the beans. The portions are huge; I got a small bowl and it was two meals, easy!

Here are the positives: 

The service is great. Every is so friendly and willing to help you. What a welcoming feeling to have a smiling face seat you and take care of you during your entire stay. 

The food: GREAT. I was thrilled by the bread used for my veggie burger. Great toppings, fresh, crisp, some local ingredients and what a package of flavors. 

INDIAN TACOS. All I can say is if you don't get them, you'll be missing out heavily. What an amazing dish. Trying to recreate at home is an ongoing project for my wife and me. 

Love cucumber water as well. Nice to see that they execute this well. 

Also, not my style, but the decor is pretty much what I would consider ""Martha Stewart's treehouse."" Mason Jars hanging from the ceiling, hanging planters on the wall, kitschy sliver ware....Nice if it's your style. Not I.

They also have a huge kitchen to work out of. Fern shares space with a catering company, so there are lots of other things happening behind the facade oft he restaurant. Pretty interesting. 

The negatives: 

Parking. What a nightmare. Not only does their lot back up to Central Ave, but it's in horrible condition. I felt like I was going to damage someone else's vehicle or my own. 

More outdoor seating needed. This location is prime for some more outdoor seating. 

The bathroom is also tucked WAAAAAYYY in the back of the building. Pack a lunch. 

All in all, not my ideal restaurant, but the flavors were incredibly intriguing. If they get some seating and parking issues worked out, it could be a pretty big Plaza/Elizabeth staple.

I was immediately impressed by the presentation, including the the nicely wrapped box and beautiful frosting. The cake itself (Red Velvet) was delicious, and the frosting wasn't overpowering, which is an issue I have with many cakes and cupcakes.

So a month after trying that Red Velvet cake I found myself in Henderson near Nothing Bundt Cakes. A look on their website showed me that their featured monthly flavor was Pumpkin Spice. I am a serious sucker for pumpkin. Every October and November I gluttonously gorge myself on all things pumpkin. So I had to go get an 8"" cake to share with my friends and family.

The store itself is located next to a pretty little courtyard with a fountain (a grackle was bathing in the fountain as I walked up to the store). The employees at the store were attentive without being overbearing, and helpfully offered me a sample of a chocolate cake. However good the sample was I was undeterred in my pumpkin goal.

It took a little while for the cake to be prepared, but the time passed quickly as I got a Boba tea next store and watched the birds in the water fountain. Before long I had a cake to bring back home.

The cake itself was amazing. The pumpkin flavor is subtle, and there is a hint of nutmeg and cinnamon.

The parking is a complete disaster because of the amount of people going to the store. You have to wait in a huge line in your car to even get into the parking lot. Once you park, you have to walk about a mile to get into the store (which isn't the best idea when you buy the entire store, going in expecting just to buy a spoon). 

Inside the store was complete chaos. It was worse than going to a theme park on the busiest day. The amount of people at the store was just crazy and, of course, no one is paying attention to where they are walking and decide to walk and stop in the middle of the aisle. Oh, and there was a HUGE line for...wait for it.....BALLOON ANIMALS....yeah I wish I was kidding. Not that I wanted a balloon animal, but the line was so long it was cutting into the walkways. 

I would recommend waiting at least a month to come here until the hype is over. Trust me, you'll want to wait. Needless to say, I went to the nearest bar after coming here to get myself a drink after surviving.

Anyways, the items in the store, prices, and layout is great. I went in thinking I was going to buy only a coffee table and came out with a rug, sheets, and some kitchen items (not fun to take to my car that I parked ten thousand miles away).

The staff definitely did wonders here trying to fuel or pre-bachelorette party night fun last Saturday. 

The restaurant appears to be an old historic house - possibly even two houses connected together by a long welcoming stretch of a patio. It had been a rainy evening and cold one at that, so it was nice to get into the dining area where the ambiance had cozy and refined wrapped up in a bundle!

I think our server was the resaturant manager. He did everything in his power to make our experience wonderful for our group of 10 girls. 

Memorable items of the night:
Old fashioned drink - very well done and potent here. My first glass was Makers Mark infused with Vanilla and I think maple as well. They ran out of it for the second round, so my second glass was with Woodford Reserve as requested. 

Rack of Lamb - the special of the night. Cooked to perfection. Tender, not gamey at all!

Scallop appetizer - Appetizes only two people since there were only two scallops on the plate, but it was served with a quaint arrangement of small thin but very flavorful well seasoned vegetables. This is big coming from me, because as an outspoken meatatarian, it is usually difficult to get me to eat vegetables, yet I loved these ones.

The homemade butter was spiced and delicious in its own right when served before out appetizers with sliced baguettes.

The place is located inside Chinatown and you have to walk upstairs. Its really ghetto in terms of the décor. The owner is really nice. His service was not bad. 

I ordered a bulgogi with rice and miso soup. It was ok. I find the bulgogi a bit too watery. I had it where it was a bit dryer and way more tastier in terms of flavor. Portion size isn't like huge.

Concrete, leather, glass...very retro-modern.  The people who refurbished and redesigned this place deserve five stars.

The people who work there, however, deserve one.  

On opening night, I forgave the delay in service.  I forgave the nasty arugula on my panino.  I forgave the store-bought peperoni.  Mostly, I forgave them because the onion straws were so good.

We went back a few nights later after being fleeced for $40 in return for table scraps at Sens.  It took almost twenty minutes to order two pizzas and onion straws.  Then, the pizzas came out before the onion straws.  How do you cook pizza faster than deep frying an onion?  The waiter lingered around the female members of our party and were just incompetent.  

We finally went again after a night of drinking at the Clarendon.  What a buzz kill.  Not only was it too dark and the music was too loud but, again, the service was slow and dull.  Then, the waitress got into an argument about the ingredients of the pizza with our group.  Big no-no.

I've had multiple people tell me that service is fine as long as you order from the bar.  They say, just get up and go tell the bar tender what you want.  Why should I have to do all of the work?

With my buddy Bates who aced MIT in 3yrs but has social issues (most genious types do).  He and I bought in for $200 each and had two hours before our reservations at the Voodoo Steakhouse in the Rio (where we're staying).  Somehow or another, and don't call it beginner luck because I know the rules of poker, I end up $500 on the positive side of things.  At this point I walk away.  $500 is enough on the first night.  Bates on the other hand is up about $1000.  I go to the room to watch some hockey and wait another half hour before our dinner reservations.
 
I come back to the table to find  Bates stacked with the ""great wall of $5 chips""... I'm talking about $2500 worth of $5 chips.  I beg him to leave but he's bombed and continues to blurt out loud, ""these people suck at poker and I'm gonna take all of their money"".  Which he probably would have, but he got so drunk he did not know what he was doing.  I watched him place $100 bets without ever looking at his hand.  Anyway, I could not get him away so I left and spent my first dinner in Vegas alone.  I could care less.
 
Which gets me to the point: I sat down and ordered Kobe carpaccio as a starter, plus a martini with blue cheese olives.  It was served with roasted golden beets and a very fine goat cheese rolled in lavender pollen.  Friggin awesome.  For the main course, I had a kobe ribeye (austrailian) that was brilliantly served with a veal shank bone roasted so the marrow ended up crispy on top.  This was truly a religious experience, topping the kobe ribeye with marrow.  Wine, you ask?  I kept it on the downlow... a 1991 DRC Richeborg did just well.  Just kidding... they had that on the menu for $15,000.  Hahahaha...
 
I went with a 2001 Gaja Brunello for $250.  All in all, I spent $450 of my winnings on an amazing dinner.
  
BTW - security just dropped off Bates.  They found him passed out on the 5th floor.  He's sound asleep.  I went back to the poker room and the guys at the table said he gave every $ back over time.  Sucks to be him.  I tried at least 5 times to get him to leave.  Oh well.

GGsvHwBW4gIrF_-TanlMzQ,TCPLaprJm4FFei2DkW6K6g,t7jfo2Txq8CPqPz6F2KDBw,3,12,8,5,"This local establishment popped up in a Yelp search recently and I decided to bookmark it. Being a big fan of soul food, especially LoLo's, I thought this might be a nice alternative. 

My instincts told me that, like some of our recent experiences up in Anthem, the good reviews are somewhat skewed based on the neighborhood that it's serving. In other words, if there are virtually no competitors nearby, the food gets praised much higher than it would if it were located in a more cut throat ""foodie"" neighborhood. Mom's Fixins, for example, is located in Surprise. With all due respect, Surprise doesn't really have an established dining culture. Therefore, my gut instincts told me that, while the reviews are glowingly positive, my girlfriend and I might wind up being disappointed.

Honestly, there's a tinge of guilt writing this review. Mom's is a small up-and-coming business that is only now finding its feet. The people were really nice, the restaurant was inviting, and the variety of options on the menu covers pretty much everything to keep the typical southern-food enthusiast happy (sans the Kool-Aid).

Both my girlfriend and I ordered fried chicken. Two legs for me and a breast and leg for her. With a meal, you get the option of picking two sides. I went with my preferred choices of mac and cheese with mashed potatoes. She went with mac and cheese with fries. Despite being told that we would receive a quarter cut of their cornbread waffle, we decided to order a whole one as well (we love our cornbread).

Before our meals were served, we were surprised with a couple of complimentary biscuits with sausage gravy. The gravy was barely warm, but the biscuits weren't too bad. I felt it was a nice touch. Little things like this are guaranteed to bring back customers for sure. Smart thinking!

As for the chicken? LoLo's this ain't. Lightly crisped, we just felt that it didn't really have much flavor in it in comparison to our favorite. I had to dump far more hot sauce than I normally would just to breathe some kind of life into it. We so badly wanted to like it, but after knowing the full potential of great fried chicken, we just couldn't find anything positive to say about it.

The lightly peppered mac and cheese was pretty standard and kind of reminded me of what I'd get in a buffet. The mashed potatoes seemed more like chopped potatoes. I've always preferred more of a whipped consistency, but I guess this might be chalked up to personal preference.

I was sincerely hoping the cornbread waffles would save the day. It's a clever little creation if nothing else. Sadly, neither one of us were impressed. They don't serve them with butter for some odd reason, but you can request it. We just were expecting a bit more of a flavor pop.  I'll reiterate what I said before. If you've tasted extremely good cornbread, it sort of ruins the cornbread served at 95% of the other restaurants that offer it.

We did not order any dessert. As is usually the case with soul food, you usually feel too guilty afterwards to risk eating anything else.  

I'm going to give it an average three stars. While we weren't really impressed with the food, the people were all very nice. Additionally, I feel like it will serve the residents of Surprise quite well. If you live in the area and you're the type that generally doesn't like to drive out of your way for a family meal, I'm sure it'll do just fine. But if you're a fan of places like LoLo's or Bobby Q's, don't go in here expecting to have a duplicate experience, because you most certainly will not.

I like Banjara because they give you choice and offer dinner platters which are, what I consider them as, ""Indian bento boxes"". 
The times I've been there, it has always been full and busy. Waiting is never too long however, so don't fret. Besides, the smells will arouse your appetite even more so, so enough to allow your stomach to.. well.. stomach a whole dinner platter.

I've talked about this platter enough, I think it's time to tell you why I liked it so much. It comes with rice AND Naan bread, a choice of Butter Chicken, Tikka Masala, goat curry, and a few other curry options. On the side there are Pakoras and rice pudding for dessert. All of this is served on a large metal plate. The portion and price are right on. Can't ask for too much more...

I like how I was able to pair the entree with either rice or naan, which are both delicious. Extra sauce goes a long way when you like mopping it with the last piece of naan.

I've tried a few other dishes here too, but I don't remember what exactly and how they tasted. 

Overall, Banjara has a lively atmosphere that is cozy but loud. It has good value for the portions but the food is pretty average. Nevertheless, I liked the platters, they give you a taste of everything you wanted to order on the menu anyways. It's a convenient package. Rice pudding I can do without, but it's nice to have a bite to satisfy my sweet tooth.",2011-10-04 17:12:51

I found it hard to believe that a Nacho joint could do anything super special. The food was decent, service was so-so, and the coke machine was broke. Their first impression was fair to partly cloudy at best.

The food was aight. Not great, not terrible. Definitely get a lot of Nacho for your buck. They're piled high and visually were pretty neat. Not very practical as they were piled high on a tiny plate. I couldn't figure out if it was more like a game of Jenga or an avalanche when I was trying to decide which chip to take. The chicken nachos were good, chicken was a touch dry, the beans were a little cold, but the chips were fresh and the other toppings very good. I was a little disappointed that the soda machine was broke, since Mexican food without soda is like peanut butter without jelly. Well maybe not that bad, but you get the point. The server was okay, not terrible not great, just middle of the road.

By the time i finished most of my meal I caught our waitress to inquire about the biscuits and gravy, she again said it would be right out...I asked her to bring a to go box since I was full. She brought the food no box...she finally stopped by to check on our meal, I reminded her that I needed a box. She walked around with boxes in her hand but didn't return so i asked another server for boxes which somehow prompted our server to return with boxes and to let us know she comped our cocktails, I informed her we had already ""checked in"" for the cocktails...her response ""oh good""...the only person smiling that provided good customer service was the one refilling our drinks (I wish I caught her name). What a disappointment, I dont understand the great reviews, there were others visually dissatisfied, maybe they're not yelpers.

But I definitely feel that it is a solid 4/5 star. I will agree with him on two things - 1. I'm not crazy about the salad bar because it's a lot of pre-mixed options and you don't have the ability to build your own. 2. Most every meat I tried was dry - I guess they'd been sitting out too long?

However, there were quite a few more important factors (in my eyes) that made me really enjoy this place. Mostly, the amazing selection! I couldn't get over the fact that there were three different kinds of ribs to try! They had some super delicious fried chicken - far more flavorful and crunchy than I have found at any buffet. And, I could build my own loaded fries - a mix of waffle and sweet potato fries, cheese sauce, shredded cheese and carnitas. 

Last, but certainly not least, the desserts! Not only did they offer several minis that were delicious (including Creme Brûlée and chocolate mousse), but I was also able to build my own amazing sundae! They had an incredible rich chocolate flourless cake that I covered with a scoop of peanut butter gelato, mini M&M's, chopped peanuts, sprinkles, crushed Oreos and hot fudge. I was in heaven!!

It is my de facto ""friends in town and want some good Mexican"" stop.  In fact, I'm freakin' shocked by the low ratings this place is getting!!

As with anyone Mexican place, they start you out with chips and awesome salsa.  There's a spicy smooth red sauce, a pico-type salsa, and the piece de resistance....the avocado tomatillo salsa.  They do, however, charge for extra chips/salsa after the first freebie refill.

I recommend anyone try the Tortilla Soup (note: NOT a chicken tortilla soup).  You can get with or without toppings of sour cream and avocado for an additional cost, but I find it perfect as is.  It's mostly broth with cheese and tortilla strips (of course), but it is just such a delish soup. For my entree, I always get #25, which is a vegetarian combo of a tamale and cheese enchilada, which I have them use mole sauce instead of traditional enchilada sauce.  It comes with refried beans (the pinto beans are cooked with pork) and rice.  The soup and this plate are MORE than enough for dinner and breakfast/lunch the next day.

They also offer a unique yet refreshing Bubble Tea(milk tea), the decor is is somewhat a cross between modern meets traditional Thai; just love their cute little ball-like lights & the atmosphere is a nice change from the typical Kent bars & eateries.

ZTQYPj_1wxxLkzF_ztDFBw,rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,SMPbvZLSMMb7KU76YNYMGg,4,1,0,1,"City Center itself is very intimidating.  I was not excited about having to go to Aria for a show recently. At least it was on a Monday night I thought to myself.

I was driving in from Henderson, so the easiest way to really access the hotel is to take the airport connector to Harmon, turn left on LVB and then turn right into the main driveway of the hotel. I had decided ahead of time to park in valet, since I was unsure where in the hotel the showroom was located and I knew the parking garage is HUGE.  This ended up being the best choice.  The valet was super friendly and used my name as soon as we stepped out of the car.  He gave me clear directions to the Zarkana showroom and also said there were restaurants nearby.  And so we were off.

The place was super busy for a Monday night. Wow.  We saw signs for the Zarkana theater and some restaurants and headed up the escalator.  (This review continues in my reviews for American Fish and for Zarakana)

Previously I have stayed in a regular room in the Sky Suites tower of Aria.  The rooms are very nice and modern.  I loved the crestron remote and how it remembers all of your preferences (I like my hotel rooms frigid cold).  The bathrooms are super nice.  This wasn't long after the hotel opened, so I would be interested to see how they have held up now.  I also like that you just have to flash your key in front of the door instead of inserting it, but I bet this causes a lot of confusion for guests.

The casino floor is HUGE.  I am SO glad that they put the theater where they did and designed the valet area the way they did, so that I didn't have to walk 5 miles through the casino floor to get to my show.  That is always so annoying (looking at you, Planet Hollywood).

The only downside is that it was a cold night, and although it didn't take too long for my car to be pulled back up, the space heater outside wasn't even turned on, so everyone waiting outside in valet was complaining about the cold.  Of course, in Vegas, nobody had on jackets yet (I wasn't one of the people complaining).

Overall, this is a beautiful hotel with great service.  There is everything you need under one roof, from dining to shopping to poker and gaming. And if it's not there, it's nearby.",2012-11-14 07:23:08

Sorry folks but this place really wasn't all that & I say that with one tear rolling down my face.  I took my friends out to dinner & we were so excited to try something new. We ordered:

Fire chicken - this was actually pretty good although it was not spicy to any of us.

Kimchee fries - this was more like meat & cheese with French fries in it. Not bad but not something I have to ever eat again. 

Wings - I really wasn't a big fan of either type & I honestly only remember the name of the soy garlic.  The other ones had this thick red sauce on them that tasted buffalo-terriyakisauce-soysauceish. My friends & I asked for blue cheese & ranch because they did need a dipping sauce.  We were told they don't have any & the owner forbids it because blah blah blah.  I think people should have a choice to have a dipping sauce. Especially in the south where ranch is life. I'm a blue cheese type of gal myself. 

Pickled soy deviled eggs- I did not care for these AT ALL. Neither did my friends. 

Pork belly- these were very dry. Some were crunchy but most pieces were not. Also, I didn't care for the sauce it came with. My friends kept talking about making mayo & pork sandwiches so they took it home. It wasn't bad but it was not that great either.  Sorry guys.

Pina colada lychee bubble tea - this was okay.

As it is located downtown, the lunch rush is 90% business/professionals working downtown. I do recommend making a reservation as it is a popular spot for those downtown. Also beware, parking sucks. 

Their lunch deal is great as it's $15 for their daily sandwich, soup,  parmesan fries AND cookies to take home with you! Take that Subway! They also have their own homemade ketchup! Its definitely on the sweeter side and I would say it's more of a tomato ""jam"", but I think it's still good. If you're still a little hungry, you can order another sandwich or soup separately. I believe it's an extra $5 but for the total price, I think it's still a great deal. 

The dinner menu is more family-style and everything is shared. My boyfriend and I had the prime rib w/ rosemary jus, the poutine and escarole salad. The prime rib came by the oz and I believe we got 10oz between the two of us. While it was enough, next time I will get the 12oz to share. Reason why? The prime rib was MELT in your MOUTH! Insanely tender and juicy and the rosemary ju just brought out the flavour even more. It also came with whole roasted garlic cloves, which I personally love (just make sure you have gum with you afterwards). We were told that the poutine was rated the best in the city, so we were excited to see what were going to try! I haven't tried many poutines in this city so there wouldn't be much competition, but what I can say is that I would return for the poutine. They give you a heathy portion and it is loaded with this amazing truffle gravy and cheese curds. The escarole salad was also very good, but it essentially tasted like a ceaser salad. Looking back it was a pretty heavy meal and the poutine was left unfinished. While there wasn't anything wrong with it, next time I will probably swap out the poutine for something not as heavy and rich. Recommend all 3 though dishes (just maybe separately)! Get the prime rib and thank me later. 

The only downfall is the location if you don't work downtown, highly recommend it if you do!",2016-03-20 02:09:11

We dropped by on a Thursday for lunch and didn't have any trouble grabbing a table. They have a pretty cute patio but only a few people were taking advantage of the 30+ degree weather. Everyone else took cover inside. 

Service was decent although our waiter seemed to be all over the place. He asked if we were sharing (of course) so they brought everything out together on one platter. Beautifully presented and seriously so much food!

- Carrot and red pepper soup - the soup was incredible. No words could describe how good this was. Filling too. 
- Wild greens with house vinaigrette - vinaigrette was tasty but the salad itself was pretty standard. 
- Parmesan fries - so many fries. The house made ketchup was good. Wish they gave you two sauce cups. 
- Kitchen pickles - you get two massive slices. Uber crunchy. 
- Daily sandwich ($16.00) - it was a BBQ beef sandwich. The focaccia it comes on I didn't feel was a very good match. Both the meat and bread were soft so there was no contrasting textures, which it desperately needed. 
- Daily spit-roasted and smoked rotisserie ($25.00) - this was slices of pork loin and was seasoned with cayenne, paprika, fennel and garlic. Pork loin is finnicky to deal with but this was quite moist and tender. The Dijon mustard sauce was sharp and you could taste the horseradish. 
- Bag of warm cookies - we were too full to eat these so took them for a midnight snack. These were delightfully fresh. The pig paper clips are beyond cute.

Wow!!!  I have never had potatoes that good.  My guest ordered the fettuccine.  The sauce was very rich.  Delectable.  He also ordered the heirloom tomatoes with mozzarella appetizer for his side dish.  He wouldn't share that one.  That mozzarella looked good.

We ordered a cheese plate to fill the time between our souffle preparation.  The plate was great,  manchego, parmesan, and one more cheese I can't remember the name of.  All three were excellent.  The plate also came with raspberries, blackberries, grapes, nuts, candied nuts, a strawberry balsamic jam, and bread sticks.  What a nice spread.  After we nibbled at the cheese plate it was time for the caramel souffle.  What a way to end a great meal.  So rich yet so light.

I was pleased with Estate House.  Next to all that Westcor cookie cutter crap this was a nice surprise on the Waterfront.  

The new GM introduced himself to us and said he and his staff have turned it around.  I agree.  It was such a nice evening.

My entree was arroz valenciana, which was very colorfully presented and was a gustatory delight.

I ordered my chicken strips (3) with the welch cheddar dip. The chicken was tasty and you can tell that its hand-breaded. I did really like it-- but I have had a few times where i find it too salty.. whether its too much seasoned salt, garlic salt or regular salt im not sure.. but it tastes a tad toooo salty (same with fries) The welch cheddar is a GREAT dip, but i wish they gave you more :( its those tiny little cups. I could scoop half a piece of chicken in it and use it all. Im a condiment person :D

One time, Bobby ordered the steak pot pie and added mac & cheese on top (munchie food at its finest) That was reallllly good! Great pot pies from this restaurant.

They had mini bowling on the top floor which was an extra $2/game.  They had skee ball and other games of the sort that cost extra money.  What was the point of the cover charge then?  I don't know.

The cover charge includes arcade games, 3 pool tables, 2 air hockey tables, and 1 foosball table.  

I couldn't believe how many kids were running around this place on Friday - the college night.  Didn't seem right to get belligerent with all those kids and even worse waiting for kids to finish playing something so we could play next.

Yes, Dave and Busters is a pricey chain and really douchey but at least it's clean, serves booze, and doesn't make you feel like you're at Chuck E. Cheese.  I would recommend this place if you're under 21 and babysitting.  Or maybe even a group of teenagers looking for something to do.  As for the adults, I would say stick to Dave & Buster's.",2012-03-06 14:01:31

I had the Prime Better Burger...the burger was a little undercooked for medium, but I didn't mind it that much.  (Yes I did put up a little fuss...but if anybody knows me - that's typical) and the short rib that was on top of the burger was perfection!!!  I had two of their drinks (I can't for the life of me remember the first one that I had, but I thought the Floral champagne cocktail was the bomb!!!  Made me extra happy.

Pretty small dining room area but they packed in as many chairs/tables as possible. You order and pick up at the same counter so customer service is really negligible. It seems like a larger scale chipotle.
Since you aren't reserving tables you can fit in a larger group (as long as you grab the seats as they become available). You can also stay as long as you want since you don't have to worry about a waiter rushing you to leave. Also each person can walk up to the counter and order their food so there is no mess with splitting the bill. 

Their turkey burger with the cilantro mess on top was awesome. BF had the steak sandwich and he loved it. Everyone else in the party seemed to be happy with their food as well.

She's 6 pounds 14 ounces, 17 inches long and I absolutely love her! Less than 24 hours old, Patience Marie is quite possibly the most miraculous thing to happen in my life since the births of my nieces in Ohio. 

So, seeing a newborn can certainly work up an appetite and since we were in the neighborhood, we decided to go to Original Hamburger Works. My mother-in-law shared a story about her last visit here, as we left the hospital. Apparently, on of the barmaids was celebrating her last day by exposing her breasts and allowing male patrons to feel their suppleness. Or offer their services in checking for abnormal conditions. Of this I was unclear. But, we verified that Original Hamburger Works does indeed have hamburgers so off we went. 

This was my first time going to OHW, and I must admit it's a bit confusing--especially if you come in the back entrance. Just so you don't walk in and take a seat (and look like a fool waiting for someone to wait on you) here's the lowdown: Proceed to the main dining area and get in line. Before you order, be aware there are many choices: First, if you're ordering a burger, they come in various sized--small one, big one (1/3#), double big one (2 of the previous patties), great big one (1/2#) and super great one (+1#). Then there's the buns, either onion, whole wheat or white. Then, there's the cheeses: Swiss, cheddar, jalapeno jack, American, provolone). If you're too intimidated to build your own burger, there are about half a dozen specialty burgers from which to chose. We ended up getting the Big One special, which came with fries for $5.49 but does not include your drink. Don't worry, though. They have a fully stocked bar in the next room! 

After your name is called, you can doctor up your burger with their selection of toppings. I went with the simple scoop of mayo. You do know white people love mayonnaise? Truly a wonderful burger.

How I'd never been to OHW prior to this weekend is beyond me. I know I'll be going back again and again. We did not, however, have to be subjected to exposed breasts during our visit. Unless you consider the ones of the chicken being grilled next to our burgers.",2009-06-14 19:12:19

I love the idea of Peruvian restaurants, Puerto Rican cuisine, Brazilian food, Filipino food, etc.  So when I saw ""Dominican"" I was excited.  Never had that before!

But I can't.

The food was not bad.  The fried chicken was cooked perfectly...lightly crispy, not greasy.  The empanadas were light and flaky.  It was all done perfectly.  But it was extraordinarily lacking in flavor.  I would be shocked if Dominican cuisine really is this lacking in robust flavors given that the Dominican Republic is in the Caribbean, settled by Spaniards who brought African slaves.  That's a lot of diverse influences and they produce a fried chicken that is just chicken...no noticeable seasoning?  I don't think so.

Even the mofongo was disappointing.  What is probably a signature dish in Dominican cuisine, and it was so bland.  It is made from mashed plantains, which didn't sound good to me, but i wanted to try it.  And it wasn't bad.

I never thought I'd pay $16 for Pad See Eiw ever.  Most Thai places only charge about $8, and in Thailand $1.50.  Seems like an overpriced Thai restaurant to me, kind of like P.F. Chang's is to Chinese restaurants.  In any case, the food here is delicious, price may not be a deterrent if lady luck is rolling with you in Las Vegas.

The decor of this place is surprisingly trendy, especially since it's located inside an older Bally's casino.  There are nice tables beside a pool of water that centerpieces a nice Buddha statue.  Pretty cool for a Buddhist, like myself, to see such a remembrance of belief.  The restaurant looks very much like a few Sukhumvit restaurants and lounges I've gone to in Bangkok.  The bubble seats, in particular, that hang from a ceiling mount at the entrance reminded me of the trendy & cool Bangkok nightlife.  Personally, I just like sitting on them.

My family and I ordered:

Pad See Eiw w/ Chicken - $16
Chicken Wing Lollipops - $9
Green Curry w/ Chicken - $17
Queen of Thai Basil w/ Beef - $16
Tamarind Whole Fish (tilapia) - $32

Everything tasted great.  Even, what I thought, was an overpriced Pad See Eiw had my mouth drooling for more.  The tamarind-chili sauce from the tilapia was exceptionally tasty.  I poured a lot of that saucy goodness all over my white rice.  Combining the sauce to an already aromatic jasmine rice made it even better.

A note of warning though, SEA charges 20% gratuity for parties of 5 or more.  I didn't really like that since I thought the service was mediocre at best.  Fifteen percent would have sufficed since our waters were not refilled even once.  And, I'll be damned if I order another $5 Thai Ice Tea.

We might never know the answer to this chicken or the egg question, but this new fusion joint is spot on. The marinade of Asian cuisine neatly wrapped inside a roll is not a new idea. Fusion burritos have been around for nearly a decade with the advent of Korean burrito food trucks. Sushirrito was the original sushi burrito concept to open in San Francisco. I've tried them all, and in the past, I've found this concept to be a poor substitute for actual sushi because the pieces of tuna or salmon were cut in such a way that they were too chewy and stringy. It was, in essence, a larger, shittier version of actual sushi. 

Fast forward to the soft opening of Jaburritos last week. This place takes a step in the right direction. Most of the menu items are affordable starting at $5.25 and up. Not only do they have raw fish, they also add a crunchy option to the mix with the offering of shrimp tempura and soft shell crab. I settled on the popular Redondo, which is filled with three different kinds of fish: salmon, yellowtail, and ahi tuna mixed with tobiko, guacamole, red onion, cilantro, wasabi mayo, and cream cheese wrapped in seaweed (soy paper also available). Each and every bite was delicious. Although I wish I could have appreciated the flavor of the sauce more, the ratio of fish to rice was great. The addition of the different self-serve salsas went wonderfully with each bite. However, for nearly double the price of some of the other fishes, I might have just ordered two separate tuna and yellowtail jaburritos in retrospect. All in all, the fish quality was great and I will definitely be coming back to try some of the other things including the jachos.",2015-10-20 05:37:25

The reason for the wait is just because they do not accept reservations. If you want to sidestep this part of the experience, lunch is ideal for you.

Now, once you are seated, prepare to read the novel menu. Don't overlook or skip over something because it sounds like it won't work or you think it won't taste good--this is a place to try new things and your taste buds will be rewarded for you bravery, I swear! They also have a wonderful cocktail menu and their hot teas are delicious and budget friendly. For the low price you get more servings of tea than I believe a human can consume in one sitting. (My favorite is the vanilla mint chai)

I personally love their outdoor patio. They have fans and/or overhead heat lamps, whichever season you are dining they are ready for you. They have the tables, a cozy seating area with couches, and a fun game section with a life size connect four...fun for both adults and children alike. 

My favorite menu item I recently have become obsessed with is the grilled salmon salad!! It is absolutely huge and has the best combination of flavors. The sesame encrusted goat cheese just makes it even more heavenly and I could probably eat a whole plate of these little lovelies on my own. You of course need to eat some sushi, it is consistently fresh and well made. I have yet to try a milkshake here but it seems like they are a hit and I constantly crave one every time I look, I am just waiting for my conscience to lower its guard so I can order one someday :)

So get yourself over here, we all know half of Charlotte will be Christmas shopping at the mall anyway, might as well swing by and enjoy a great meal before leaving the area! Enjoy :)",2016-11-12 17:31:35

FOr drinks we both had their Quattro Fontemara 2011 Red, which was a nice blend of various grapas; merlot, sangiovese, etc...etc.. so it was easy to drink along with our foods we ordered; 

Fried Polenta; lightly breaded with a garlic aioli! breaded to perfection, and not oily! well presented.

Roman Salad: baby Kale, toasted capers, boiled egg topped off with Parmegiano frico and caesar dressing.. this was a delighfully fresh dish!!!

Italian Ham pizza! was great! just way too much Arugula! and I found the pizza to be a little charred underneath!

The price is very fair for now, with lunch specials from $7.99-10.99 and afternoon tea for even cheaper.

No sooner than we sat down we had a basket of chips and two different salsas. I really liked their salsa. I wasn't a fan of the chips because they were not served up hot but I ate them anyway because the salsa was just that good. Spicy and delicious...just like I like it. 

The menu had great variety and the prices were excellent! I ordered the Deluxe Taco Salad with chicken - It comes in a tortilla shell with tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream and cheese. 

Our food arrived so freaking fast! My goodness! What a major win for the very hungry lunch crowd! 

My salad was just okay. Don't get me wrong, it was not bad by any means and the portion size was not a problem. It was the tortilla shell. It was not crispy like I'm used too but that's just my personal preference. I still loaded it up with salsa and enjoyed every bite.

As for the food, the salsa is runny and the cabbage slaw always has a rancid flavor. As for entrees, nothing really stands out. Most recently I got the fajitas and the Chicken wasn't great and the vegetables were even cooked. The beans and rice are okay but I feel like they sit on the plates and get heated up right before being served. Half the time the rice a overcooked because of that.
I will say the fresh made guacamole is good. Definitely don't pass that up.

I had Sweet Republic on the top of my ""must eat"" list while in Arizona since I saw them on Bon Appetit's 10 best ice cream shops list. Although they are located in Scottsdale, they are 10-15 minutes north of Scottsdale Stadium (where the SF Giants play). We drove up for ice cream after a Saturday afternoon game, and the shop was fairly empty around 4pm. That was great since we had time to look at all the different flavors for their sorbets and ice creams, and also sample a couple before having to make a decision (the Maple Pecan flavor I tried was pretty good). We finally settled on a scoop of Salted Butter Caramel (Soft Buttery Caramel Ribbons in Creamy Vanilla w/a Sprinkle of Salt) & Almond Buttercrunch (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sweet-republic-scottsdale-2?select=yz2rj3V6U4KXcpnPnYS-cw#yz2rj3V6U4KXcpnPnYS-cw). I thought I liked the salted butter caramel more, but the almond buttercrunch really grew on me the more I ate it, especially when I got a bite with the buttercrunch. The salted caramel at Bi-Rite Creamery in San Francisco still wins the salted caramel battle in my book, but I still enjoyed the ice cream at Sweet Republic a lot.

Another stop for my DDD list.  I am not sure why I keep falling for this.  Of course the food was,""Killer!"", like everything Guy seems to eat. 
Well the crab cake, what we started with, was not ""Killer.""  It was mushy, under seasoned, and tasted and had a texture more like paste in the inside than lump crab. 

I had the shrimp and grits and my friend had the blackened salmon, both totally edible, in fact they weren't bad.  I wish that the sauce on my grits was a little more viscous.  It began to get watery at the end.  My friend enjoyed the Salmon, but apparently it was slightly over seasoned in areas.  

My partners main complaint was that the portion size did not match the price.  For the price maybe the salad should come with the meal.  Also they're grits for crying out loud!  It's cheap hominy corn.  Put some more of them on the plate with the four shrimp.  It was an entree right?  ""How long does it take you to cook your grit?""  Joe Pesci fans, Unite!

They had a special memorial day dessert, it was for the troops of course, so we tried it.  It was advertised to us as a cobbler, but it ended up being more of a shortcake type of dessert.  Never-the-less it was delicious and we gobbled it up.

The final downer was the being rushed, but we're not rushing you atmosphere.  I hadn't even got my full ass in the seat before the waitress was asking us what we wanted to drink.

For what it was in my opinion it wasn't really worth it because the amount of food in comparison to competitors for lunch and the flavor fell short. I thought that their Quesadillas (Dilla) took a very interesting take on it though. They serve these in a form of a sandwich almost and in a basket. In the dillas though, they stacked it with potatoes, which to me was an interesting take. But, the thing about it is that it lacked flavor and that to get any kind of taste you sort of needed to dip it in some sort of sauce. I'm not big on dipping quesadillas in sauce it sort of takes away from a good flavorful experience. 

My coworkers ordered some tacos, however at the price point, I definitely would recommend to skip this and just get a Dilla. The amount that you get isn't worth the price and that you could most definitely find a better alternative around the block or travel a few more miles down the road. 

All in all, there wasn't anything exciting about this place. As I said, overhyped as one of the best places ever. I feel that my experience in Phoenix, there were a lot of better options for lunch out there, but if you're tied on time this place is a quick take out spot.",2017-09-13 16:13:43

The show itself is very charming.  Hearkening back to what I consider the ""Golden Age"" of Vegas, it highlights moments and acts from the 1950's, 60's, and '70's, covering all the staples of the vintage Vegas entertainment scene (save for the Beatles), but that's another show at Planet Hollywood.

The performances are really solid.  Not impersonations (the cast doesn't look like their respective cover songs in many cases), but their performances are earnest and heartfelt.  And there is a lot of diversity in the acts.  Singing, dancing, a clever magic act including birds out of every and any scenario, and a few other highlights.

There is a Liberace marionette that is an excellent caricature of the pianist himself, right down to a shiny little car, and an even shinier costume and piano.  I've never heard a ""live"" Liberace performance, but the recording used highlights how utterly effortless Liberace found playing the piano.  The voice just chatted away like it was nothing, and then decided to ""do something more"".  The puppet was amusing.  The actual recorded performance was something else.

Then the tap dancers, Shaun and John.  Those two have moves.  They are utterly remarkable in some of the things that they can do.  I could have watched more of their work, and wish it could have had a return performance.

The whole cast was good.  There's a lot of talent in that production, so good for them in having a nice ensemble like that.  At the end, during a rendition of Elton's John's ""Rocketman"", they had a montage of favorite Vegas entertainment moments.

Then came the sobering part.

The whole show is this love letter to decades of talent and incredible acts, in all of these legendary venues defined by the true stars that graced their respective doors, and then you see the open/close dates of SO MANY VENUES, followed by the implosion shots of these places exploding.  Gone.  And it's sobering.  I've never experienced any city like Las Vegas so callous and eagerly zealous to destroy its own history, and for anyone who grasps that sense of history that was once here, it's like a punch in the gut.

That aside, Vegas: The Show is a fond reminder that something greater once existed in Las Vegas, with a fantastic cast, great music, and a lot of ground covered.

I've never heard of Vegas: The Show until last night, but now that I have, I'm glad for it.  It's a remarkable ""hidden gem"" in all the shows out here, and worth the time.",2011-02-16 23:53:53

This place isn't worth the prices, not worth the rude staff and nor is worth the ignorance.

General admission is $32-37 and almost double for a ""fast pass"". Without a ""fast pass"" we were unable to go in to the latest haunted house and waited over an hour and a half for the roller coaster. From 7pm to midnight we made it on a total of 3 rides and 1 haunted house. In previous years I was able to enjoy more than double that.

The quality of the environment, exhibits and actors took a dive this year. Fog machines were over used and actors were under rehearsed. In previous years I would have considered this a must go to in October and given a 4 to 5 star rating. This year it was not worth going to and was frustrating with how over crowded it was. 

The value was not there this year. Purchasing a ""fast pass"" would have left me feeling even more cheated. It seemed like the general admission allure was there only to up sell guests to a ""fast pass"", which was a lackluster value with how many guests had bought one. All the vendors were overpriced and offered less selection than previous years.

The crowds were unorganized and the staff did not seem to have any control. This event seemed like a no rules apply high school public groping session. No supervision, which was to be expected, but no security or staff to monitor the fights.

Overall, extremely disappointed this year. I'm going to pass on this event in the future. I would not recommend going to Fright Dome this year.",2013-10-29 18:06:55

Went by on Monday 1-18-16 around 5:30 because I had a sweet tooth.  I picked up six cupcakes and the total was $14.66 after the military discount.  It would have been $17 and some change without the discount.  
. 
Strawberry cupcake- I loved the delicate pink color of the frosting but it tastes like they used artificial strawberry flavoring out of a bottle.  The cake was dry and crumbly and the frosting is pure sugar and fell apart because it was too hard.  I don't recommend this one.  
.
Peanut butter and chocolate cupcake- The cupcake had a peanut butter cup baked into it and the frosting was soft although very sugary. It had a cute little peanut butter cup half on top.  
. 
Vanilla cupcake- hard as a rock and the frosting crumbled into several pieces.  My 1.6-year-old didn't want it so he fed it to the dog who seemed to enjoy it. 
. 
The other three are still sitting in the box at home and I don't even want to eat them.  They will most likely go in the trash.  Here's a list of things I'd rather do than eat the rest of those cupcakes: 
.
1) Get a root canal 
2) Wait in line at the DMV for 3 hours 
3) Get a pap smear 
4) Listen to country music for 10 minutes 
5) Diet and exercise for a month and gain 4 pounds

I think what I find most appealing about Olesia's Place is the way it fulfills both my constant desire to explore new ethnic cuisines and my parents' wish for familiar, traditional fare.  Thai or Indian restaurants are too far outside their comfort zone, but Ukrainian they can handle.  

Between the three of us we tried the potato pancakes, cabbage rolls, pierogies, borscht, and a fish sandwich special.  Everything I tasted was excellent, well above average (take that with a grain of salt though, because my exposure to these foods is from restaurants and the freezer section of the grocery store, not ""grandma's cooking"" like it is for so many other Clevelanders).  I didn't try the fish, but my dad sampled everything and he said it was the best thing on the table.  I especially liked the garlic butter they brought with the bread, the smoked sour cream that came with the potato pancakes, and that they let you get one cabbage roll with each sauce (tomato and mushroom - both are fantastic).

Not a bad  choice at all! The waiter was really attentive and our orders came really fast. It could be because the restaurant was almost empty. It was good we didn't order appetizers because then I'm sure we would have needed doggy bags. I got the well-done beef shank pho and my friend got the Pho Da Lat special. Our orders came in huge bowls, filled with steaming hot liquid, meat, and veggies, with a side of a few bean sprouts, a lemon wedge and some basil leaves, and of course Hoisin sauce and hot sauce. I'm glad I went easy on the sauce because the pho was so hot (not spicy hot...temperature hot) it made my eyes water.

Comparing to its close neighbour, gourmet burger, the patties tasted much better. Something about gourmet burger's patties just puts me off.

We started with a Caesar salad which was okay. I liked that they weren't too heavy in the dressing (though I would have preferred it without). Also, I didn't really think the size of the plate was appropriate. If you take a look at the picture, the salad seems very small. I ordered the veggie burger. 

The burger itself contains 36 different vegetables, and it is topped with greens and an aioli. It came with potatoes and ketchup. I mention the ketchup because it isn't what comes out of a Heinz bottle. I have no idea how to describe it, but their ketchup is really good. The potatoes can be a little salty, but I enjoyed their crispy outsides. The burger itself was good, but nothing great. The bun stayed dry and firm as I ate, which is always a plus. 

Lastly, we had blood orange sorbet for dessert. My first thought was, ""Wow, this is sweet,"" but it was fine after I got used to it. My friend said that she couldn't guess what flavor it was last time she was there. Still, it was refreshing and a welcome treat on a warm day.

We came here for dinner, so we managed to avoid the crazy lineups I've read so much about. It was after 8:00, and the dining room was emptying out, but there were still a few groups of people there, many families, and some with kids running around. I've come to expect this kind of behaviour when dining at establishments that welcome families and children and I have just decided to not let it bother me. 

While arriving a bit later did get us seated right away, it did also mean that some of my favourite menu items were no longer available including the rice noodle rolls. That being said I really did enjoy all the other favourites that we ordered. We maybe went a bit overboard, and had to take some food home with us, but I have no regrets.

Priced on the steep side like everything else, the snow white fish was served with a sweet potato and squash puree that my guest practically licked from the plate. Mon Dieu! Goma-ae green beans and scallions decorated the fish centerpiece and the glistening miso glaze added the perfect amount of sweetness. This was the dish that eliminated any doubt that Kasa Moto's kitchen had refined skill. Compliments to executive chef Michael Parubocki and his team.""",2017-10-12 16:12:48

I stumbled upon this place with a colleague of mine, completely by accident. Hidden away in a less-than-desirable area of downtown Vegas, is this little gem. The interior is super clean, and there are areas to sit everywhere, which is nice because this place gets BUSY! The staff is helpful and friendly, which is a nice change from some of the places downtown.

My go-to for food is the avocado toast. Yes, I know the blah-blah about millennials and their avocado toast. And no, I don't care. This stuff is GOOD! The only complaint I have is that it is $2 additional for 2 strips of bacon, and they will consistently FORGET the bacon, but definitely charge you for it - so keep an eye out for your bacon if you order it!

I've tried a few other dishes here and they've all been good. Nem Nuong is fun to say repeatedly. It's also yummy to eat.

Nem Nuong Cuon:
Sausage and veggie spring rolls. They have some crunchy bits in them. Probably the best version I've had in town. They named the place after this dish - they better be good! 4.5/5

Chao Tom Cuon:
Shrimp/ shrimp paste with veggie spring rolls. These also come with crunchy bits. I get tired of eating these, to be quite honest. So, I go back to eating Nem Nuong as a chaser. 3/5

Pho Tai Nam:
Rare beef and flank soup with vermicelli. Fantastic broth. The portion is just right. The noodles aren't stuck together not chewy - even when you get it to-go. 4/5

Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio:
Grilled pork, egg rolls, and veggie vermicelli bowl. The grilled pork is so tasty and not burnt. I love the egg rolls - the meat is well-seasoned. Again, the noodles are great. 5/5

Prices ranges around 10$ and up so its quite on the pricey side for some of their dishes. I think its worth it though, they cook some good stuff.

Prices are pre fix for groups if you want ($27 per head or +$4 for a steak from the same placed sourced by Barbarians). The pre fix menu brings out appetizers to share for the whole table, then three different types of pasta for the second course (their veil lasagna is to die for) and then you choose your main carne course, and they will bring out a vegetable and salad platter to share. Well worth it, and it makes drinking without a care even mroe fun because hey, you've only spent $30 on dinner.

If I put it at the edge of the table empty he looked at it twice and walked by again. We had no cheese for our dinner and no one to ask for it. . None for my veal Parm or for my pasta which was not hot nor was my veal. It was warm but not hot. Must have been sitting in the kitchen. There is no excuse for this type of service in any restaurant especially with the owner sitting right in the center of it. Shame on them.

Quality and Price: Regular mani only is $18 (plus tax and tip round it to $25). Pedi only is $3x (didn't do pedi only).  Mani-pedi is $45 (plus tip and tax you're looking at $55). For the price, I am very pleased with the quality of my nails on both hands and feet. The technicians know what they're doing and you get your arms/feet/back massaged during the process.  My regular finger nails lasted 2.5 weeks when I'm careful, and about a week when I'm roughing it in the woods up north.  Pedicure lasted 3 weeks (including the trip into the wilderness - camping, sneakers, flip flops, lake water). After your nails are done, you sit under the UV for a minimum of 10 minutes while the coats harden. 

Service: Great service. CP24 is available to watch if you're not a talker (the girls know their cue.  If you want to talk, they will, if not, relax).  I went in for a mani appoitnment and despite their busy schedule, they were able to accommodate a pedicure. Mani's last 30 minutes, pedi about 45. If you're doing both, allot 2 hours time at least. I don't remember who did my nails the first time, but I had Amanda the second time and she was fabulous (better than the other IMO). Her massages of the arms were on pointe, shoulder massage was great, but lower back could use a little work (or skipp it entirely and just do shoulders). Meticulous work and hygienic (they open a new/clean/unused tool pack for every client). 

Overall: Great experiences, would return again. The only con is that they are always very busy.  They need to hire more staff or expand. Some stations were empty but people were waiting because staff to patron ratio was unbalanced.

LATER EDIT: Returned with a friend and had a lovely girl named Marika working on me. Absolutely adored her. Perfect service, kind and thorough. She double checked each nail's reflection to ensure a smooth polish. If I return again, I would definitely seek her out.",2013-07-15 06:03:59

It's a very cute restaurant, like a wooden cafe, bright, clean cut and spacious.  

Purposely came on a weekday because of all the reviews saying how busy and slow the service might be.  When we got there, there were only 5 tables, so it wasn't too busy or loud.  

Drinks are written on a wooden plank which adds a nice unique touch to their wooden theme.  

The menu looked tasty, and I wanted to try many things, however my tummy didn't like that idea. 

We went with the Wasabi mayo takoyaki.  The takoyaki was really good, crispy on the outside, and nice and mushy in the inside with a fair bit of octopus inside.  The Wasabi mayo didn't have much of a flavour, could have went with the regular takoyaki.  They have tempura flakes which adds a nice crisp. 

I got the crab meat and avocado rice, my boyfriend got the gyu beef Don.  The presentation is very nice, with ginger, cantaloupe, edaname, marinated egg.  
I found my rice to be a little dry.  It needed another item to be mixed in, perhaps some cucumber or something to make it less dry.  The mayo wasn't enough for the rice. 

My boyfriends gyu Don was really nice.  Good amount of onion and marinated beef and wasn't dry at all.
The portion was pretty good, enough to feel really full. 

We tried 2 drinks for extra $2.00. I tried the lychee yogurt slush, and my boyfriend got the ginger fruit tea.  His mug was huge, and gave a nice aroma.  The ginger adds a little coolness to the throat when you drink it, so it's nice on a winter day. 

My lychee slush was presented in a mason jar.  Cute presentation! I couldn't finish mine, so got a to go cup, and brought the rest home to slowly sip on :) 

The service was really good, very attentive, and food came quick and hot. 

When given the bill, was given a coupon for free ice cream, expires end of February (they crossed out the January 31 and replaced with February) 

Will definitely come back and try a different bowl. I saw the tempura bowls coming out from the kitchen and they looked really good with lots of veggies and large shrimp!!",2016-01-22 05:18:17

I came here in a group of 6, so we can try more dishes, there was about 2 other tables and some people picking up take out orders.

The food came fairly quick, I like the portions, not too large, great for sharing. There is MANY selection, will come back to try more food! The food was mainly a hit with a couple of misses. But because there is so many different flavours in each dish, I don't expect every single dish to fit everyone's taste buds. so of course some will be his/miss with this huge menu. Stick to the items you like and you will enjoy the food they have to offer here. 

The downside for me is the location, it's a bit far for me as this is at the very north end of markham, and in a tiny plaza, but because there isn't really any other good businesses around here, it's easy parking.",2013-05-13 21:48:39
nj5SmHjC3GJlto3uAlL7Kw,ZpTrjeZQ4c_9YA018SXnwA,-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg,5,6,0,3,"Food: Udipi is 100% vegetarian South Indian cuisine.  The menu is huge with plenty of appetizers, dosas, soups, entrees, and desserts to choose from.  We ordered the ""Royal appetizer platter"" which gives a sampling of all of their appetizers.  For $7 it was easily enough to feed 4 people and give everyone multiple tastes of each appetizer.  The dosas are huge.  We ordered one to share among two people as a second appetizer (we were hungry); one person at our table ordered one as his meal.  The entrees, again, are huge and delicious.  You can request how spicy you would like the meal made.  The baseline spiciness is very tame and shouldn't upset even the most sensitive palate.  Surprisingly, Udipi does not have naan or vindaloo on the menu, two of my favorites, but I am not very knowledgeable about the different regional cuisines of India, which may explain this.  It didn't matter remotely, however, as every meal was fantastic.  I highly recommend the Channa Batura, which the menu describes as a ""large puffy bread"" and it is in fact at least the size of a watermelon when it comes to your plate.  Luckily, for my waistline, it is mostly full of air and deflates, but was more than enough to eat for dinner and lunch the next day.  The menu offers unique Indian dishes that you will not find at most Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh.  

Price: The prices are incredibly fair considering the quality and quantity of the food.  On a menu with 50+ items less than 5 were priced more than $10.  Most were in the $7-9 range.  Two of us shared an appetizer, dosa, two entrees, and two mango lassis for $39 with tip included.  Remarkable.

Drinks: BYOB.  There are non-alcoholic Indian drinks to choose from as well like the delicious mango lassi.

Atmosphere: Udipi seems to be in the middle of nowhere.  The address is Monroeville, but it is on Old William Penn Highway.  If you go at night, you drive through darkness and then a shining beacon of light appears, which is Udipi.  The interior is like a cafe/diner with booths and small tables.  The decor is very modest, which focuses all of the attention on the delicious food.

Service: The wait staff was prompt and friendly.  They answered all questions we had about the menu and were more than happy to make sure we got the exact dish we wanted.  The food and drinks came quickly, they spared us time to eat the appetizers prior to bringing the entrees, and the bill came quick.

(+): great food, great price, great service

(-): driving out to Monroeville to get there

Would I go back again? If I was in the area, I would no doubt go to Udipi as often as possible.  Living in the city, I'll drive out there occasionally for the incredible food.  If you're craving Indian, its worth the drive.",2012-01-08 16:08:08

I'm on the fence about this place, or should I say, ""on the wall."" Ok, Russian/Commie jokes aside....

Headless Lenin out front of the Red Square has finally won me over after years of enticing me to visit each time I walked by, all thanks to their happy hour that's now daily from 4pm-7pm. My friend and I met up here on a Saturday evening for pre-concert drinking and noshing. First impression of the restaurant: it's a cross between a run down church that was converted into a communist hideout and an upscale bordello -- I can only imagine. It's on the gaudy side, but I actually dig the decor. 

The place was rowdy and packed with patrons who were mainly hanging around the bar area eating and watching games on the mounted televisions. We were lucky to find seating at the corner by a window. Our server gave us the happy hour menu and a separate dessert menu upon request. 

Duck Fat Fries: French fries fried in duck fat topped with shredded parmesan cheese. The fries come with lemon aioli and tomato jam dipping sauces. Fries fried in duck fat sounds deliciously gluttonous, but I think the flavor -- to me -- needs to be acquired. Both dipping sauces were good. I thought the tomato jam tasted similar to cocktail sauce, but it complemented the fries as opposed to the aioli which did a better job at masking the duck fat. 

Summer Blueberry and Peach Pie: I was anticipating a slice of pie, but I actually received a personal size pie with a small scoop of ice cream on top. The crust was flaky and had a slight crunch and there was more blueberry than peach filling. The sweetness of the pie alone was perfect and didn't give me a sugar jolt. One downside about this dessert is the side of caramel sauce that I didn't bother using. It was in a separate pouring container, but I wasn't able to pour any caramel sauce onto my pie because it was solid....

Service was slow, but overall it was fine. Our only issue was tracking down our server to pay our bill because we had to head off. However, it was almost a full house on that Saturday evening. Slow service is expected.

Although it was a busy happy hour, a return visit is likely, but it might have to happen on a weekday.

I'm always impressed but a bit intimidated by the exhaustive small book sized menu they have.  The good news is the broad selection of cuisine they offer from Cajun, Mexican/southwest/Asian and more.  The bad news is it's a lot to absorb and select from.

I've never had a terrible dish at any CF location but some are better than others.  They make a pretty wicked Cajun chicken over pasta which is just the right amount of spicy hot and delicious.  Like most of their entrees, it's large enough to split or share which I recommend you do if you even remotely think you may want to sample one of their famous cheesecakes for dessert.

We went here last Friday so the soup of the day was clam chowder which I usually like.  Theirs was tasty but too watery, not creamy as I like it.  We were a party of 6 and I didn't hear anyone else complain so I presume everything was to their liking.

I took my own advice and saved room to share a slice of fresh blueberry cheesecake which was good but definitely not outstanding.  My wife is a dessert guru and extraordinary cheesecake is in her repertoire so I am not easily impressed even with what is supposed to be among the best.  It was good but not great.

Finally, my biggest complaint about this place is the lighting.  Granted I am approaching 63 and my eyesight is waning but even the (younger) others had trouble reading the micro print on the menu.  I had to use my cell phone to see it which could be somewhat embarrassing for others.  It's just an inconvenience for me.  I've eaten in darker restaurants but they all have strategically placed overhead spotlights to help the vision compromised diner like me.

The CF is pretty dependable and I don't see much difference among their locations.  After all, I suppose that is the whole point of a chain eatery - consistency and predictability regardless of which one you patronize.  Their restaurants are all nicely decorated with friendly servers and like I said, seemingly endless selections of food and drink.  A fun place to go for any event or just for a tasty and satisfying meal.",2014-08-12 20:18:43

Li Wah offers a good selection of the standard Dim Sum fare, and the food is tasty.  It ranges from the standard (pork rolls, shrimp) all the way up to the weird stuff like duck's feet and large slabs of broccoli.

It's a phenomenal dining experience with the finest quality foods molded into divine creations with superb drinks and wonderful service. Props to Ashley!  I exclude the attitude of the hostess as her stilettos clearly were shoved too tightly up into her backside. 

The beef is incredibly tender and succulent, the crab and lobster meat are fresh and delicious, the heartiness of the short rib appetizer is overwhelming balanced well with a slightly sweet butternut squash risotto.  You can tailor your meat to perfect your taste including toppings like crab, lobster, foie gras, etc but I loved the jalapeño onion. Sauces are only $2 but you don't need them, the meat is juicy and delicious on its own. Definitely get the corn pudding as a side. 

The ladies enjoyed many fine cocktails and my friend (total wine snob) and I had four different glasses of wine to complement our meals and tasted about 10 in between. 

We dined early at 6 on a Friday because we had show reservations at 930 and we left just around 845. I definitely recommend eating earlier because its less crowded and then as you're dining and drinking it gets packed with fantastic trendy music. It's on the louder side but definitely not too loud.

My husband went brunch and had huevos rancheros which was a very light dish. I sampled the red enchilada sauce and enjoyed that as well. We split chips with a trio of salsas. All of the salsas had great flavor and the hot salsa definitely packed some heat which I loved. 

I really wanted to try the tacos, but you are limited to one type of taco with the taco entree which was surprising since I've never seen this done before.

We were staying at the Luxor so my husband and I both got free entry here on a Saturday night.  Even though there was a super long line when we got there, we were able to talk to the bouncer and he led us straight in.  We must be special like that.

The entrance is a little tricky in heels.  Really steep stairway, and really dark.  First you go up, then back down.  But once inside, it's just that really cool ""Vegas"" vibe that you just can't seem to find anywhere else.  The dance floor is good sized, and there are a couple different bar areas.  Standing room only.  It was super crowded when we were there.  I liked the mix of music that was playing...mostly hip hop and top 40, with a few old school faves thrown in.  Contrary to what some of the other reviewers mentioned, I really only saw mostly good looking people here.  A little heavy on the testosterone, but plenty of (attractive, young) females, as well. 

I mostly stick to shots (can't go wrong with those, really), so I can't say whether the drinks are ""good""...and I didn't actually pay for any of mine, so I don't even know what drink prices are like here.  I remember feeling a little frustrated when trying to find the restroom (all the way to the back), but the shots could've had something to do with that.  My only other annoyance was how the VIP area was set up right beside the main dance floor, with only velvet ropes separating the two...being just a ""commoner"" encroaching on ""their"" space, it was a little weird.  But not a deal breaker.

LAX made for a really fun night, I've definitely experienced far worse.  This has actually been one of my faves in Vegas, so call me easy to please or whatever, but I'd totally go back!",2012-07-18 21:16:19

There are 3 lots available: the very expensive valet lot, self-park, and economy. Self-park and economy are pretty similar, though I recall self-park being a little more expensive. Economy is further away than self-park for sure. Economy is around $38/week, which is way cheaper than taking a taxi both ways.

On the way in, take your printed parking ticket with barcode. You can either place it in your car in a safe place, but don't put it on the dashboard. You'll need it when you leave. I suggest removing anything visible that looks valuable, like a GPS or your garage door opener. The location is fairly sketchy. On the way out, scan your ticket, then your rewards card, then the discount coupon, then your credit card.

The economy lot is a pain when it rains. There isn't proper drainage, so rain forms pools of water. The shuttle buses usually come by every 15 minutes, unless it's very busy, in which case the shuttle bus driver should call for backup if they're too full to pick you up.

A few tips:
1. Enroll in the rewards program to earn Aeroplan miles.
2. Visit the Park'n Fly website to print a coupon. It will save you a substantial amount of money.
3. When parking, take note of which area your car is in. There are signs by the road that indicate the location (e.g. B95). This is different than the shelter location (e.g. B11). It's important to write down both otherwise you'll end up like me and arrive at the right shelter but walk around until you can find your car in the sea of cars.
4. If you want a guaranteed spot on the shuttle bus, walk to the shelter closest to the entrance.",2013-07-19 05:32:34

Don't believe me when I tell you that the lunch buffet here consists of about a dozen main dishes and at least ten of them are superb.  Please don't believe me about just how delicious the tikka masalas are, or the saag paneer (creamy Indian cheese and spinach).  Please, please, don't believe any of it, because if you do, then you will start coming here and your friends will follow and soon I won't be able to get a table.

Seriously, the secret of Indian Paradise is that they cook everything very expertly.  The only downside -- it is a relatively small buffet -- is really a blessing in disguise, because if they had even one more option, I would have to try it and would then be unable to rise from my chair at the end of the meal.

Here is what you will get (in general, as the menu varies somewhat from day to day): chicken tandoori, chicken and/or goat curry (their goat is a rare misfire, often too bony), chicken or cheese tikki masala, at least one creamy spinach dish, a couple of other meat entrees, lentils, several vegetarian options, at least one of which will be pretty spicy, rice, naan and one other bread, a couple of appetisers (like samosas, for example), a half dozen sauces, and rice pudding and honeyed cheese balls for dessert.

First and foremost they brew excellent beer. And they brew it about 2 miles from my house. And every single person involved loves brewing beer more than most people love their mothers. Two of these three things are integral to a quality craft brewery, the other is just a geographical bonus.

But let's look past that. Every Tuesday they brew a new small-batch NoDable Series beer that you can only get at the tap room that night (and very occasionally the next day if the batch hasn't run out). Lavender coriander Belgian wit, breakfast stout, farmhouse IPA. They really take the opportunity to play around.

The tap room is open in the late afternoon and evening so don't expect to park it here all night. Pop in after work to sample their wares and be on your way by 8. The beers run between $4 and $5.50 (maybe $5, i forget). So really, you are getting the best of both freshness and economy!

First I totally agree with previous reviews that complain about the location of the TVs. They are in such awkward spots and are only tuned to like two different things, which is semi-annoying. However I can't complain too much when one of them is tuned to Sportscenter which is all I really need as I eat my lunch. My major complaint about Majerle's is that it is a very awkward space. There is a hostess stand out front on the sidewalk but no one is ever there, so you have to walk in and then BAM you are like on top of the bar. So you're in the way while waiting for a hostess which I hate.

Other than that main complaint, I'm not going to hate too much on the food. It's a freaking sports bar. They serve sports bar food. I am not expecting five star cuisine...I just fried goodness that will clog up my ateries and beer on tap. If they have a salad or two so I can feel better about myself, great. For the most part everything I have tried has been good, including the potato skins, grilled chicken caesar wrap, fried chicken salad, kids grilled cheese meal (hey I wasn't hungry that day!) and the house salad. The french fries are really good especially dipped in ranch. The only thing I didn't really like that I have tried has been the chicken tenders. Something about them was just a bit off to me.  Prices are decent considering the proximity to US Airways Arena and Chase Field.

OK.  East Fremont isn't the best neighborhood around.  But Pepe's was nice and clean.  I arrived at 7:30 or so on a Sunday morning.  I was the lone sober, non-Spanish speaking patron in the establishment, I think.

I stood in the short line and perused the menu on the wall.  The owners were helpful enough to place English words behind each item on the menu... i.e. lengua = tongue, cabeza = head.  The drunk, 5'8"" dude with the Elvis do directly in front of me went with tres tacos lengua.  Nice.  I think I'll pass on the lengua today.

I ordered a couple of tacos al pastor and a cabeza taco.  The lady behind the counter pretended she didn't speak English, which is fine.  I don't think she liked the cut of my jib.  I threw a couple bucks in the tip jar and headed to a corner table.

They certainly do have a lot of great beer at reasonable prices. No food is served, other than snacks. You can bring food or have it delivered if you must.

The space is beautiful and has lots of old woodwork to admire. It's a pretty small place, and can get cramped/loud.

I'm shocked at some of the reviews saying they've had poor service. I've been here dozens of times and have always had friendly folks serving me beers. I was there on St. Patrick's Day, and the ladies working the bar were fantastic.

Now, I'd give Malt House a full 5-star review, but I do have one problem with the place. And that problem is...when they have live music. This bar is small and loud as it is. When they stuff a band in the corner and blast out some music, it is SO...LOUD. There really isn't any reason for my friends and I to go there when there's live music, because conversation is impossible. For a bar that size, it's rather strange that they would even have live music.",2014-03-19 20:17:13

This location as always busy. Ive been holding off on the review. Each time we go i feel that they just dont have it together. Maybe its just a poor manager. 

Food has always been great. The last time we went our server was awesome. 1 out of 3 visits..it should always be awesome or at least good.

On a side note: you bartender gets a 1 star for pouring beer into hot mugs. Had to get the beer replaced a few sips in because it had already got warmish.

Still not sure if we will be back. So many great spots to go in this area.  That going somewhere that is not giving it 100% seems like just a bad idea. Even if Applebee's is somewhat a good deal price wise",2016-03-22 03:18:10

Had I not had my heart set on a burger, I would have turned on my heal and gone next door (who had a friendly greeting just viewing the menu).  I overheard the table next to me going on about the ridiculousness of these horrid hostesses after being sat by one.  These girls had a ""what are you doing here?"" attitude. I imagine one of them answering the phone: ""Holsteins, you're welcome.""  Perhaps Smiling 101 could be a start?

That being said:  Server (Kyle) recommended the Rising Sun burger and it was THE best burger I've had EVER.  Tempura avocado, nori furikaki, crispy sweet potatoes...give me one right this second.  Service was cool, friendly, and professional.  Nicely done.

Atmosphere was fun and lively, but the stupid bass from the DJ was literally vibrating the booth I was sitting in.  Let's go for quality over quantity here, Holsteins.

Another issue altogether...Anyway, their beer on tap is pretty good, and they offer a few other selections as well, but don't go for the mixed drinks. Anytime a friend has ordered one, they either didn't have it, or it wasn't very good. This is a beer joint. Especially If you're a Miller Lite (L-I-T-E, if you've heard the commercials) fan. Al's is always packed in the summer, and pretty calm during the colder months, so if you want a crowd and a lively atmosphere, head out while the weather is warm. When it's cold the crowd seems to shift to Kennedy's, the nice lounge/restaurant next door.

New club in the new Cosmopolitan Hotel on the strip.  As you're walking towards the club, the first thing you will notice is just... how perfect this hotel is for girls, and it's actually quite smart of them.  The decor has a lot of bling, pink, red that just attracts girls' attention.  Vegas glam with a modern twist.

The club is no different.  The entrance is located on the 2nd floor and as soon as you walk in to go upstairs, it just grabs your attention.  You are brought to a House Floor where they play everything electronic.  Most of the weekends there is a famous DJ spinning on the main floor.  Huge huge LED screen right behind the DJ, so that's pretty cool.  There's amazing talent each week spinning and it's now Kaskade's official new resident in Vegas.   Keep walking, and there's an outdoor area with cabanas and tables for bottle service.  I was lucky enough to get in for free and friend had a table near the table so I got to enjoy bottle service.  The outdoor area is not as big as XS but it feels more accessible and not as random.  Of course, no jumping in the pool and I don't think the bouncers even let girls soak their feet in the jacuzzis if you have a cabana.  There's a bar near the end and the restrooms are towards the corner (mucho important).

One floor below is the Hip Hop Room.  Good music throughout but didn't stay long since friends were on the main floor.  There is a ""Library"" room above that plays a mix of everything as well.  I can see the older crowds up there.

Drinks are around $13-15.  Bartenders are nice and be sure to tip well so you can keep going back to him/her!  At one point... I think my Kettle & Tonic was just pure... Kettle, not that I'm complaining :P  Bottle service here is just ridiculous though.  2K-3K minimum so if you're with a group of guys... tough.

Be sure to come early!  Even if you are on the guestlist, if you're not there early (9pm), you're gonna wait.  Be sure to have 1:1 ratio or else... good luck.  Bouncers are douches here, inside and outside the club.",2011-04-28 18:45:30

Okay, background to qualify me to say this- I was raised in a family with a parent who is a Food & Beverage Director at very prestigious hotels all over the World. I grew up on 5 star restaurant food and basically lived in hotels. I moved out to the Phoenix area about ten years ago and eat out all the time. I have had meals for two that have cost $300 that didn't taste as life changing as the food at the Centurion.
A work friend has been bragging about this place for years now and for years I thought he was just exaggerating. Nope- wow- our taste buds were dancing with joy!
So this place has a pretty good beverage selection ;-) and the food they serve are Tapas (small plates). I believe there may be certain dishes you can order in an entree size but you'd have to check with them.
Our group sampled a few rounds of different beverages. They are very knowledgeable about their beer and wine choices and will even offer small tastes to pair with your tapas. Their menu is completely seasonal as they use fresh ingredients. We sat in the room with the kitchen, which is extremely small and you would never in a million years expect the quality and flavor in the dishes to come out of that kitchen. 
We ordered many items between two couples, here is what my Husband and I ordered: 
-Risotto of the Day (Pumpkin with a light cheese) x2- and then again at the end of the meal- my husband wanted more too, it was so amazing. Light and creamy and topped off with some very lightly sea salted pieces of delicate pumpkin. Wowza- incredible!
-Papas Bravas - ""Potatoes Pan Fried in A Spicy Pimento Sauce, Finished w/ Chive and Garlic Crème Fraiche"". Most delicious and flavorful potato dish I have ever tasted. It was impressive that the outside had this nice crispiness to it but the inside was so fluffy.
-Chef Eric's Bolognese - ""Over House-made Fettuccini"" - Super flavorful and delicious! 
-Stuffed Mushrooms - ""Stuffed with Pesto Risotto and Wrapped in Prosciutto w/ Aged Cheddar Tarragon Sauce"" - OMG- Wow, flavor explosion. Cannot stress enough how delicious these are and you will love them regardless of if you like mushrooms. 
-Baked Brie - ""Brie and Raspberry Preserves Baked Fresh to Order -  Inside of Puff Pastry"" - Just melts in your mouth- yummy yummy!
-Pancetta Wrapped Gnocchi - ""With an Aged Cheddar Sauce & Harissa Toast Points"" - Okay, I honestly loved every single item we ordered, but I imagine these flavors in my dreams. This is probably the MOST DELICIOUS thing I have EVER eaten in my life. Wowza- no joke, get here, order this, make your food dreams come true!

We also had two desserts- one light and fluffy like a giant macaroon and the other was their famous chocolate siracha cake. Both delicious!

The fish was some of the best I've had in a long time. The tartar sauce is amazing. The fries are good. There was plenty of food for the price it still seemed a bit expensive at $18. ( this is why the 4 stars not 5)

The chicken sandwich was brought to us still raw. Management took care of it and brought out another one. The flavors and ingredients all mix well together and is amazing.

I must say I was impressed, and I think I would have been even more so if I had ordered something other than what I did.

I got the seafood sampler ($16) and a cup of seafood chowder ($7). The chowder was great; not too heavy and not skimpy on the seafood. The sampler, however, was just that. There was a sizeable king crab leg, three jumbo shrimp, and a generous portion of ceviche, but just one measly clam and one measly oyster. I should have gotten the baker's dozen of oysters, which are just $21 during happy hour. I did, however, take advantage of another happy hour special: Oyster shooters are half off, so I got two (lemon drop and Cajun olé). Pretty tasty, and a steal at $2.10 each.

My husband fared better with his selection of Shrimp and Scallops Rosa: plenty of seafood and veggies in a tomato vodka cream sauce, served atop pasta for $19. The broccoli seemed like a weird addition to me, but he liked it. And it was a HUGE portion that resulted in leftovers that he can eat for days.

Service was fine, and the prices were pretty reasonable--especially when you look at the portion sizes of most items. Just steer clear of the overpriced (and underrepresented) seafood sampler. And if you're there for happy hour, you'll really find a bargain or two!",2017-01-31 01:15:38

I ordered the lunch combo which was 2 rolls and a choice of soup. I started out with the shrimp won ton soup, which was a nice change from miso. I was glad I was able to taste actual shrimp in the wonton. 

My rolls were the spicy tuna and the eel roll. I was pleasantly surprised so see the spicy tuna had asparagus in it. Something different to set it apart from other places, and it was very good. The eel roll was great with some eel sauce on top that wasn't too overpowering. I was full after my meal and felt satisfied without breaking the bank.

A note for vegetarians and vegans, my supervisor asked if they had vegan options and our waitress quickly brought over a menu. Not just ""oh we can give you a salad or some rice"" they had a decent sized vegan menu, and obviously more vegetarian options.

Owned and operated by Suni Chabrow with a menu crafted by her longtime friend and business partner, a former bodybuilder and attorney downtown, Dougie J's Café is Sin City's only Patriotic dining locale and with a portion of the proceeds benefitting the Memorial Foundation of Suni's fallen hero son it is undoubtedly the sort of space that everyone would love to see succeed, the potential no doubt there but a few tweaks necessary before the food will truly 'wow.'

Patriotically decorated without pandering to the ""USA, USA"" crowd it was after contacting Suni directly about the restaurant's concept and the possibility of ordering a few 'half-portions' to better assess the menu that I arrived at for Saturday lunch and with both Ms. Chabrow and the menu's creator present throughout my hour-long stay it can only be said that the whimsical cuisine and story of the space was interesting and inspiring, respectively, while both were thoroughly explained.

Largely opting to indulge in breakfast, while allowing the Chef liberty with portion sizes and price, it was with a full order of The Riz that the meal began and featuring well-saturated brioche from Bon Bread at its base the French Toast sandwiching Nutella and Whip was decidedly sweet, a pitcher of artificial maple syrup thankfully unnecessary both here and in the follow-up blueberry pancake that was fluffy and well aerated, more than suitable for sopping up butter as well as blueberry reduction though the berries within the batter were somewhat disappointing and bland.

Chatting with the proprietors as I ate, stories including Soni's decision to pursue a lifelong passion for making English Toffee striking a chord about the value of following one's dreams, it was next that a whole order of the Pink Diablo arrived and drawing on concepts other restaurants would just as happily attributed to Elvis both the portion and flavor was plethoric, though much of the nuance was lost due to far too much peanut butter, a half portion more than enough to satisfy my curiosity though I did indeed pay for a whole.

Next sent out a half ""Bubba,"" a dish I neither desired nor requested but was happy to try given the staff's glowing reviews, suffice it to say that between the watery pastrami and substantial amount of slaw little of the $6.50 I was charged for the gift was worth it, the 'Dougie Sauce' a lone exception with a whole lot of heat packed into the Russian-Style cream.

Back to items I'd inquired about, it was to a haphazard 'torn' half biscuit alongside fried chicken with thick country gravy that I was treated next and with the bird pounded flat and nearly flavorless while the biscuit large but no better than Bisquick suffice it to say this was a major miss, a fact made all the more humorous when the man behind the menu idly poked fun at the food at Hash-House-a-Go-Go before also admitting the lazy-man ingredient was used in Dougie J's signature blueberry coffee cake - a dish still well worth ordering given the substantial use of cinnamon and delicate, buttery crumb.

Unable to make me an Apple Fritter, one of the items I'd specifically requested and one that Suni couldn't stop raving about even after telling me the restaurant had failed to procure apples on that day, it was with a single ""Bad Influence"" cookie that my meal ended and served hot and gooey from the oven with bits of Suni's Whoa! Foods Toffee filling the batter alongside bittersweet cranberries anyone in the area, which means anyone in DTLV or East Fremont, should consider stopping in to grab one...or perhaps a dozen as it may just be the best cookie on Las Vegas Boulevard right now.

It was between the rib cook off and here. We spent about $50 less here than we would have there and had a fun night to boot. The chicken trio was great, and my normally not-impressed-by-fancy-restaurants boyfriend loved it. Also the potstickers and sauce were da bomb. All 4 of us liked out dishes and it was lots of food. 

The just ok: The service. A little slow, but friendly. The salmon duo. I think it's dangerous to do duo's because one is always better than the other. In this case the salmon curry was way better than the teriyaki, and unfortunately both were way over cooked. I think the curry salmon should be it's own dish. And I would ask for it medium. The menus. I know, it's a weird thing and didn't affect my rating, but they are this huge bulky, drift wood piece that you can't see over to talk to the person across the table from you. I also don't think they fit with the otherwise very classy ambiance. The other weird thing is they are selling their centerpieces. There is a sticker on them with the price. It seemed tacky.",2013-06-05 13:46:47

Really, I don't ever come into XXI thinking I'm looking to buy things...I mostly look and end up with only accessories. To look for something specific is quite a hunt so I'd recommend to come and roll with it. .I was rather pissed my last time looking for 80's  clothes for a party and a very specific kind of 80's look (80's valley girl) .  Don't do it to yourself...come with general ideas like wanting a new dress. 

 I think the idea of a department sized store is a clusterbitch, and it will always be a touch of chaos, but I think I have to give a bump up for the staff. 

I walked in and the staff was genuine in greeting people, enthusiastically. I was curious in this 70's boho paisley tunic and couldn't reach it. A SA helped me and when all of them turned out to be smalls, he went around the store looking for the right size and was super helpful. Staff walking by made sure to say hello. If you look like you were searching, they came to check if they can help out. 

You REALLY need efficient staff to keep a place like this as painless as possible. It's vastly improved since my last visit where I was on my own, and the staff was definitely overwhelmed that Saturday. Last visit, there wasn't enough people to ask, some seemed confused, and the dressing rooms were messy/backed up. There's a lot more staff this visit and it's only a weekday.

It comes alive in the spring and offers ample foliage in the fall.  Bikers, skaters, runners, walkers, and stroller mom's alike can enjoy the softly rolling hills and the paved pathways.  Circle the water around the fountain, cross the stone bridge, feed the ducks, rent a B-Cycle, or catch a show in front of the stage on the grassy knoll.  Picnic on the lawn or grab a covered table.  Hoist your hammock or toss down a blanket.  Let the tykes loose on the playground and watch them monkey around in the genuine old train engine.  

Freedom is home to Charlotte's Annual Festival in the Park.  It is also the site of numerous soccer and baseball fields.  In addition, you'll find tennis courts, volley ball areas, and more.  You'll even see folks doing yoga in the grass.  A part of the NC thread trail, known commonly as ""the greenway"" to locals, runs just behind the park and can be accessed via a number of connector bridges.  

Need engagement photos?  A wedding venue?  A birthday party spot?  This place will not disappoint, and it's a photographer's dream.  Memories are made here; be it guys popping the question to kids learning to ride their bikes.

This will always be a CLT favorite for me.  Parking always looks like it will be a challenge, but truly isn't with the constant in and out of vehicles.

I really never understood that line - the flavouring on Thai cuisine is really intense (I mean the balancing of sweet/sour/salty/spicy -- not this odd perception that Thai food has to be spicy).  Even though Thai food is made for Western cutlery (no chopsticks!), the individual portioning (most Asian meals are 'family style') and there's less focus on 'offal' meat than most other Asian cuisine - I don't understand the popularity for Western palettes.

However, Salad King has pretty much perfected the Thai formula for a Western audience - it's pop and tries to be all things to all people.  If you doubt me, check out the line-up for this Salad King on any given night.

While Salad King isn't bad by any means - it's really mall food court Thai served in a slight nicer dining room.  The portions are big and most people don't really care that it's relatively bland (adding spice to a dish is the same as drizzling hot sauce on anything).

When I'm hungry, I usually grab takeout from Salad King - the off-menu Islamic noodles (chicken pad thai with a coconut curry) is the go-to.  It's not the best Thai, but the portions are big and their takeout system is down to a science.  It's perfectly serviceable, but not much more beyond that.",2015-11-22 04:34:02

My husband & I have been eating out a lot lately, and every place turns out to be meh, very mediocre, but this place lives up to the hype. It is FANTASTIC! We came on a Saturday & made reservations for 8. When we showed up, our couch was ready & we got to lounge while looking through the menu surrounding by their cute decor. It is very garage sale chic. 

We started off with the Cape Cod Fry or whatever it was called. It was delicious! Less than one month ago, I was at Disneyland and ate so much fried garbage that I vowed to never eat anything fried again but my husband really wanted this, so I succumbed and was happy we ordered it. Everything was very lightly fried (there were peppers, clams, and calamari rings) with high quality ingredients. For our entrees, I ordered ""My Wife's Favorite Salad"". Oh my goodness. I eat a lot of salad. Usually at least once a day, but this was my favorite salad ever. The duck confit was magnifique with that poached egg that oozed yolk all over my lightly tossed greens. I sometimes do not like fruit in my salad, but the pomegranate seeds & orange slices in this salad made it amazing. There was sweet, salty, crunchy, and indulgent (that fatty duck) which made this the perfect dish. 

My husband ordered the Filet which was SO tender. Oh my goodness. They gave him this steak knife that wasn't serrated so I was wondering how he was going to cut through this thing. That crappy knife cuts through this filet like butter. It tastes like butter. It melts in your mouth like butter. For $32, this steak was WELL worth it. If you're craving steak, DO NOT GO TO OUTBACK, come here instead! You get it on top of a bacon potato hash which is amazing! I wasn't a fan of their steak sauce though. It tasted like A1 with BBQ. Next time, I would ask for it on the side. We also got Mac & Cheese on the side (so yummy, cheesy, and creamy) as well as roasted cauliflower with kale (this was alright). For dessert, their baked in a brown bag apple pie with their salty caramel ice cream is a MUST. That ice cream definitely has chunks of salt in it, but is so good with the apple pie. They balance each other out perfectly, which is great, because I tend to dislike overly sweet thing. Overall, I am SO excited that we finally tried Honey Salt & we will certainly be back.

Tip: Make a reservation. My in-laws showed up on a Monday night. 1 hour wait. We came a couple of Fridays ago, 1 hour wait. Just make a reservation if you know you're coming. This place is always packed because it's AMAZING!!",2013-06-05 15:05:11

A cute Filipina waitress with more shakes and buns than what is served here helped us with a smile, trying to squeeze herself into her little dress. That is how all the waitresses dress here, actually, a lot like the girls that eat here, in tight short dresses. At this time of night, it makes sense, because right across the hall is the Marquis Night Club, the main late-night-place-to-be at the Cosmopolitan, especially if you look 19 and Asian.

We ordered simple little meals as follows:
Red Stripe - $7
Dragon Fruit Drink - $10
Black and White Shake - $8
Artichoke Guacamole app with chips $9
Truffle Lobster $16.50
Pizza Twinkies $12
Mini Holstein Sliders (2) - $9

The Black and White was great, reminded me of Fenton's Creamery in Oakland, with both chocolate and white chocolate mini malt balls on top. 
The Artichoke Guac was meh. The sliders were tasty, but puny in size. Pizza Twinkies looked like 2 large Geno Pizza Rolls.  

The meal totaled $77.29 with tax, for nothing very filling or completely satisfying. When you throw in a tip, that is nearly $100 for a 3 way snack. 

I tried to fill up on eye candy though. And it was entertaining to see the people in line across the hall herded into the club like cattle, first being branded (ID check) then shuffled through roped holding pens, then stampeding into the meat packing plant.",2011-09-30 04:31:31

My wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich with two sides: fries and creamed corn. I ordered the pork rib combo with: 4 ribs and two sides which were corn bread and Mac N Cheese. 

The counter service was exceptional. He was patient with us, explained the options, offered his opinions and made us feel comfortable. He also checked up on us twice after we got our meals. 

Pulled pork Sammie: good but not great. Definitely needed sauce but it had good flavor. They were running 2/1 that day so we got an extra one. Nice. The fries and creamed corn were okay. I thought the corn was runny but my wife said she liked it. 

My ribs were good: good smoke and chew, cooked nicely and sauced just right. They gave me 5 ribs, just cuz. The corn bread was eh. It had jalapeño which I like but needed something else. Maybe honey baked in?  The Mac was outstanding. Good creaminess, crispy topping and dark spots. Good stuff there.

Personally, I'm a little confused by it because it's a mix of American diner circa 1950's, a helping of Elvis memorabilia, and various Mexican accoutrements scattered throughout. Their outdoor patio has a completely different feel with it being adorned by tall tulip figures. I like their outdoor patio better and prefer sitting out there over the very busy inside.

I've been to Chuy's a couple times and am always pleased with their service. The wait staff is very friendly and willing to offer suggestions and accommodate any changes to the meals/drinks, if need be. You start off with complimentary chips & salsa. The salsa is a little on the watery side but packs a silent punch when it comes to the heat. The chips are light and not too greasy, have a nice crunch. This go round, I decided to give their blackberry margarita a try. According to our waitress, Meaghann, the blackberry marg is specifically made with top-shelf liquor. The house margaritas run $6 (they're served on the rocks or frozen) and the blackberry margarita runs $9 and is only served on the rocks, so keep that in mind if you're looking to drink at certain price. I found the blackberry margarita to be all right but it wasn't too strong on the blackberry flavor. I could tell it was made was some sort of artificial flavoring.

Each time I've been to Chuy's, I usually order some sort of enchilada. To me, nothing pairs better with a margarita then a cheesy, loaded enchilada or taco. I decided to try one of the combinations (which are a great deal and good way to try other types of things) - the #4 with your choice of enchilada and relleno. FYI: a relleno is a stuffed pepper. I got the chicka boom enchilada (trust me, I felt just as silly saying it as I did typing it out) with green pepper sauce and a cheese-filled relleno. The relleno was fried and coated in two types of sauces plus a drizzle of sour cream. Because of all that, I didn't really taste much of the pepper. The enchilada was delicious and I wish I had ended up ordering two of those instead of the relleno. The standard sides of refried beans and rice were good as well.

Since Cowfish (which is located next door) is crowded quite regularly, Chuy's is a good alternative and encourages you to have a little bit of fun with your meal.",2015-05-27 23:49:43

I have been a loyal fan of Beaver Choice, and have highly recommended to all my friends to try it.  Tonight, I was extremely disappointed at the whole dining experience. 

We had all placed our orders at the same time. The waitress indicated that the kitchen was behind and it will take about 5-10 minutes to put the ticket inside.  We agreed.  Another friend came after we just placed the order, sat over 20 minutes without any type of service (no water or even a menu).  She had to get up to ask for them.  I know you have expanded but might just need to hire more staff to help on weekends.  We all had to ask for refills many times.    

After 1/2 hour of waiting, we noticed the tables around came after us got their food
even few ate and left.  I felt it was a deja vu moment reminded me the very first time I visited in the Tempe location.  They had lost our ticket and we waited over an hour too. However, the owner came out to our table to apologize.  

This time when the owner came around to chat, we mentioned we have not received our food and indicated that tables around already ate and left. By now, it's over an hour!  
We are very patient people, others would have left by now.     

The owner came back with our waitress showing us the time that the waitress placed our orders on the POS receipt.  We knew we had placed the orders way before time indicated on the receipt.  The owner kept telling us they prepare it freshly and will take time to cook.  Again, I was loyal customer so I should know how long a normal schnitzel takes.  Over 1 hour is just unacceptable!  I felt I was in the episode of Amy's Baking Company when the owner accused the customers they were wrong.  I know the owner here is not Amy and Sammy.

The sandwich is great for what it is. You got bacon, egg, and cheese all baked between two brioche buns. It got the job done really well and it didn't take long for us to get our food after we ordered.

If you want to sit on the patio just be smart and plan ahead, those who complain about waiting for a spot clearly just assumed a patio this cute was going to be empty for the taking! 

Food
We ordered the bread and butter, garlic fries, nduja and ricotta, fried chicken and chorizo verde. My favourites were the nduja and the chorizo (my friends raved about the garlic fries and chicken too though!). The nduja is essentially a crostini with a delicious combination of sweet, spicy and salty topping. The chorizo was also very good, loved the potato and cabbage stew that was underneath! Only thing I would comment on is the bigger dishes are a little hard to split between many people given they are more like plated entrees. I am impressed the food all paired really well with the beer, that says someone in the kitchen is equally passionate about their food and the beers (a rarity for brew pubs in the city). We paid about $27 (tip included) each between 5 of us and def. weren't left hungry! 

Drinks
Almost everyone ordered the Omerta (?) which was a slightly fruity, hibiscus noted brew. It is still quite a bit hoppy like most of Bellwoods' beer so you do need to like that ""beer"" taste. With that being said it might not be for everyone! They do carry other brewery beers too so i would ask for a recommendation if you aren't a big beer drinker to begin with. 

Service
Double thumbs up! I find service so hit or miss in Toronto but I'm glad to see something so hipster seeming doesn't have that cold-shouldered vibe. I asked the ladies who greeted me if I could put my name down for a spot on the patio while I waited for my friends to arrive. They seated us inside and moments after receiving our drinks they came back to let us know a spot was open on the patio. We did have to ask for odd things like napkins and cutlery that you would think would come as soon as any food came to the table but a small hiccup is forgivable once those trusty forks arrived! 

I'd highly recommend this for groups of friends or a date for any beer/food loving pairs, especially during the summer season when you get to enjoy the patio space.

Many have come and gone over the years, and it seems in order for these places to stay in business they need to over-inflate their prices and not worry about the decor.
I always make it a point, to stop in at a japanese food store while visiting a major city in the U.S. (L.A. or San Diego). They actually have A Japan town that supports an area dedicated to just Japanese foods.
I find in a city the size of Calgary, they actually split both Korean/Japanese foods together in the same store. Or Chinese/Japanese in the same place. I guess whatever works.
At Arirang, they carry the usual things you might expect to find in a Korean supermarket. I find the Japanese selection is slowly dying. 
I agree with other reviewers, when they say the service isn't the greatest. I find unless you speak Korean in these stores you get treated like a second class citizen. I thought it may have been in my head, but believe me when I say they are very indifferent towards you, and it gets worse if someone they know who speaks Korean walks in the door starts to interrupt and wants something. 
Items they carry on the perimeter of the store are as follows, from the left working clockwise as you get in the door. a drink cooler with coffies etc, bags of rice, coolers with noodles & soups, mayos, wasabi etc, coolers with gyoza, freezers with seafood, coolers with miso paste,  a small produce section with green onions, bok & suey choy, etc, cooler with kimchi various size containers, next to that is a meat counter with pre-cut meat for making your own Bul-go-gi, or Sukiyaki. Next is an open refridgerator with some homemade sushi and takeaway Bul-go-gi, and other items they like to put on special to ""clear out "". Next is some more items, weird stuff (don't know the name's). thern a cooler with some frozen items you can take home to make your own sushi. Oh yeah they also have a sort of  ""salad bar"" thingy cart for weird Korean side dishes here too.
lined from left to right in the middle (inside) of the store from memory are as follows freezer with fish, dried seaweed (nori), soups, sauces, soya teriyaki etc, seasonings, crackers, teas, chips, cookies, candies, etc.
The front ends have tea and some other items that may not normally tie in with a grocery store, like shampoo or hair dye, or massage stuff like tiger balm or something like that.
It might have something to do with the fact that theirs a small Korean merchandise type store next door (accessible from within the grocery store itself). 
In conclusion, I think that they whole little strip mall may be Korean leased. Their is also a Korean bakery, restaurant, and chicken restaurant. They also have at least one more Korean leased space in the mall I can't recall at the moment what it is.",2011-11-07 01:26:59

1. I appreciate the thought and personality of this restaurant. It produces a highly stimulating experience: from the gadgets and screen ordering to the educational language lesson in the bathroom. 

2. The decor has been well thought and executed. Branding gets an A+...from chopstick wrappings to the wall art.

3. Milkshakes...mmmm! Tuna nachos...wow! I could live off those two items alone. 

While the above items are a big turn on, the turn offs leave me feeling mixed. During the soft opening, the service was excellent (to be expected). My next visit, the server seemed less than thrilled and then especially when I handed over a living social deal. Turn off indeed and left a lasting impression. While the tuna nachos and milkshakes make me swoon, the sushi is large and in charge, but average. However, the burgers are good. 

The menu, like others have noted, is like a novel. Plan to spend the first 10 minutes reading all they have to offer.

Keep in mind prior to my visit i had no dental issues or pain but since the last dentist visit was almost 2 years ago, i figured i needed some care. The fillings were extremely painful ! I am unable to drink, chew or bite into anything crunchy, cold or hot ! i went back after two weeks  to let Dr Yeanga know about the pain. After charging my insurance for another visit, i was told the pain is reversible and its due to close proximity of them to the nerve. Its been almost 2 months and im still in pain ! I regret going to them every time i eat or drink now ! Unbelievable !!!!!!",2013-09-09 03:33:21

Sure the fish section can be overpowering when walking into the market.  Actually, it's rather disturbing how smelly it is.

But I still YELP this place! 

When you walk into the building to your right are the restaurants.  

Starting directly next to the market entrance is a place not too many people are familiar with.  All I know is you've gotta get the pigs feet (which is sliced up for you), it comes with sesame leaves, lettuce, sauce, jalapeno slices, garlic and rice.  I take the meet out of the sliced pigs feet, wrap a little bit of everything into the sesame leaf...OH, BOY!  Party for your taste buds. 

Next to that is Island Style.  Yummy Yummy!  My favs are Bim Bim Bap with chicken, pan fried dumplings (on request), Guk Su Bap, and Hawaiin Sun Green Tea.

Just after, is a sushi joint.  I've only gotten the Korean Style Jirashi...absolutely love it.

Then Chapgetti...momma gets the Jaja Meoung.  It's here favorite along with some sweet potatoes.

The next restaurant is stuck between Chapgetti and the new Thai restaurant.  It too is oh, so good.  We usually get the steamed pork buns.",2011-09-02 23:19:30

It was my first sushi restaurant experience back then and it got me hooked (traditional Chinese folk don't usually eat raw food so this was a big move for me at the time) .  I have introduced many of my friends to sushi at the Sushi Inn.

The line ups back in the day, before the tsunami of sushi restaurants that opened since, were really long here.  The problem I found was the ventilation and air circulation there was not great.  The fryer is in the middle of the restaurant so your clothes, hair etc always smelled like tempura when you got home.  It really helped when they opened up the downstairs section but the atmosphere was different on the lower level.  So I would often choose a seat near the door but the cold winter air was not good if you sat while people stood practically on top on you while you ate.

The restaurant still has a huge draw from the Yorkville crowd.  Though I don't come as often because my current group of friends are big eaters and they prefer AYCE places.  When I'm in the area and craving for sushi, I still drop in.  Their bento boxes are reasonable, sashimi and rolls are decent quality (a bit too much rice on them than I usually like) but I really like the dragon B... 4 star rating for me :)",2010-10-17 19:09:35

It's very rare to find consistencies between stores, particularly in the service department, but walking into this store was like walking in the Manhattan Beach store- as if both experiences were taking place mirroring each other. Instantly the decor, the warmth, and the staff made for such a pleasant entrance. 

The only difference I came across was that I couldn't have all the flavors at once, at least not during the holidays. It was explained to me that their store limited their flavors for the season, which given their traffic and probable demand for the larger cakes made sense (I believe, after all, that the Vegas stores are the firsts) so that got a pass.

The drive isn't that bad if you take the Interstate 15; it's only a couple of minutes after you exit. We got there in fifteen minutes from Mandalay Bay. There was plenty of open parking (unlike some casinos) and the signs to the buffet were easy to spot. The casino was offering a $24.99 4th of July dinner menu. I also noticed a promotion: if you got their player's card and played at a table for an hour, you could earn enough credit for a buffet. I figured I would lose way too much so I opted to head straight to the buffet. I loved how clean the air was. The huge, open buffet room had a glass wall separating it from the casino. There were only a couple groups of people in front of us in line, and we were seated right away. A bunch of extra napkins were placed on our table and our waters were served as soon as we came back from our first trip to the buffet. Unfortunately, that was the last time we saw our server the whole entire meal. I knew she came by because our dirty plates were taken away when we were getting our food. But by the end of my meal, I was so parched from no water refills. It felt very unpleasant, and I would say I was disappointed in the service. In reality, the service was nonexistent. I forgot what the waitress even looked like. Even the servers from the other tables didn't want to acknowledge us. Oh well, I tried to make the best out of it. My family and I were able to sample some wonderful tasting foods. There were such a great variety of dishes served that day. For example there were BBQ ribs (American BBQ section), Kalbi ribs (Korean), and Honey roasted ribs (Chinese). My favorite dishes were the Poke tuna, Lomi Lomi salmon, prime rib, and the green chili verde pork. My least favorite was the bland, lukewarm make-your-own pho.

Before I get to the pizza, there are a few appetizers that also deserve praise. The Golden Calamari is wonderful. The breading is light, but crispy, and the squid is cooked exceptionally well. Also, Gram's Meatballs are some of the best meatballs I've ever had. The combination of the pork, the beef, and the veal, makes for an amazing flavor combination, and the tenderness is perfect.

THE PIZZA: The only way this pizza could be any better is if they fed it to me. The pizza at Dom DeMarco's is AMAZING. I have never once been disappointed. They have two different styles of crust, New York Style Thin and Square Cut Thick. Personally, I think the thick crust is better, but to each their own! My absolute favorite pizza is The Di Fara Special. Fresh basil, pepperoni, two different types of cheese, it's so simple, and yet it's so fucking delicious! The best part, is that the pizza is huge! It could easily feed a family of four and potentially have leftovers. Dom DeMarco's also does carry out if you feel like staying in for the evening. 

THE VERDICT: Dom DeMarco's will always have a special place in my stomach. If you're craving pizza, you're doing yourself a diservice by ordering delivery. Make the journey, it's worth it, and your stomach will thank you for the days to come.",2013-05-14 20:09:57

The black beans (you can choose either black or pinto) are the real gem; they were cooked perfectly and topped with cotija crumble cheese. Baja offers a salsa bar and most of it is okay.

Seriously folks I go out of my way to stalk wherever they are serving whenever I get a craving and have to hold myself back from having a huge hissy fit when they are closed. It's just that good!

Anyway, the Pig Mac is definitely their signature item but they have many other types of gourmet grilled cheeses as well. My wife got the Little Green Muenster tonight which was avocado relish, a wasabi sauce with Muenster Cheese; this one wasn't her favorite as she felt that the Wasabi sauce didn't really go with the flow of the whole sandwich. However she has had their Mushroom one which she loved!

The only downfall is that they can run out of food very quickly if you don't get their early enough. Tonight they ran out of their Smoky Tomato Bisque and their Pickles. It was sad times not to worry I am still a loyal fan of Papi Quesos!!",2016-04-02 02:04:01

The bread would've been delicious all by itself.  It was perfectly toasted to bring out the warm goodness of the filling which was just as good.  I hugged it up with the apple cashew salad with honey mustard vinaigrette.  The sweet/crunchy/sour worked well with the kickass club, but I should've passed on the too-sour lemonade (a little too heavy on the lemon, guys).  Definitely worth the $12 I paid for lunch.

Not sure why others gave the service a pan, but my experience was good.  The waitress was friendly and gave great suggestions when I asked her what she regularly takes home. The food came quickly too.

Decor is interesting.  I see what folks mean about the pastry case tho.  It's drool-worthy, but it's in the damn way.  They should do an ""order here / pay here"" setup with a ribbon line like Moe's and an express line for the coffee-and-a-donut folks.

The pork and shrimp dumplings were also good and tasted great with the Chinese broccoli side we ordered. It was our first time trying the boiled noodle with spicy peanut sauce and we thought it tasted interesting, but good. The broth had a milky consistency with peanut flavour and the noodles absorbed the flavours of the broth. The beef tenderloin came out very hot and sizzling on the stone plate.

This restaurant was very close to Eaton Centre (2 mins walk from the Yonge Street Entrance). To me, Salad King is a Thai fast food restaurant. It looked like a canteen since all the tables and chairs were made of metal. Everything was so packed and squished together which didn't make me feel too comfortable. In a good way, they maximized the space so they could contain more customers during rush hour. The wait time was very short and the table turnover rate is very high. The place is very loud, it makes it very difficult to chat with your date/friends. However, the waiting time for dishes was longer than expected, which was not compatible with the restaurant operation structure. 

-- Food & Drink --

We ordered two items: 

1. Phud Thai with Chicken (medium spicy) $9.75;
- I liked how the tofu and peanuts blend in well with the rice noodles. The lime made the dish less greasy. 

2. Panang Curry with Chicken $9.75;
- This is a very sweet curry with a strong taste of coconut milk. I cannot find any peanuts in it, and I found the coconut taste too strong and sweet.

And always check them out on Yelp beforehand, in case there are secret menu items.

On my first visit I had to try the secret menu item that everyone raves about: the Islamic noodles. Not sure why it's called Islamic, but I vaguely remember reading that the ingredients may be halal. Do not rely on this though, please check with server. But lets get back to those noodles. Extremely fragrant coconut milk taste in the smooth nutty sauce with a hint of spice. Portions were also huge. Not sure if it's worth the $11 though. A slightly cheaper alternative would be the siam noodles. The sauce tastes very similar just minus the coconut and a very chunky peanut. Also if you have a serious nut allergy I would try to avoid this place.

First visit was ruined because some putz decided he needed to whoop it up during the World Series thus ruining the dining experience for nearly everyone in the dining room. The management should have stepped in but they chose not to.

The meals that night - ""the pig"" pizza and the bolognase were tasty as were the desserts so the place warranted a second try.

Tonight was the second try. 15-20 min quoted wait mid-evening on a Wednesday. OK. We got seated after about 15 minutes. Server was reasonably prompt. The pig and chicken parm were the orders. The pig tasted like someone had spilled a salt shaker on it. Disappointing. Chick parm was pretty good. It's weird that southern Italian (tomato) dish was accompanied by pasta in a thick cream (northern Italian) sauce. We let our server know we were ready for a to-go box. She promised drink refills and a box. It was nearly 15 minutes before she reappeared. No refill. No box. It was another 5 for a box, no refill and presentation of the check. No offer of dessert. Which, had we not been waiting now some 20 minutes after having finished eating, we would have ordered. It was a full 30 minutes from finishing eating until the check had been signed.

Management unable or unwilling to control an out-of-control diner. A server who abandoned a table. Excessive salt on the pizza. Enough. Done here.",2017-11-09 05:52:47

We ordered a Kalbi dinner ($20) and a Bento Box C ($18).  The portion of the Kalbi was *big*.  It was tender and tasty.  I thought it could have been marinated longer, but my BF thought it tasted just right.  Many reviewers praised the freshness of the raw fish slices, whether they were served as sushi or sashimi.  I totally agreed and would like to add that the chef did not stuff the maki rolls or nigri with rice.  It had made the food much more genuine.  I had to add that the tempura was perfect, just perfect!  It was fried crispy on the outside, with just a really thin layer of dough.  It was hot, tasty and moist inside.  I don't usually enjoy fried food, but I enjoy the tempura here much.

Rating: (9/10) Food, (8/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (10/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness

My Experience:  
Been here several times, and it's one of the top 'boil houses' on my list. Amongst this boil house craze and all the countless boil/harbour/catch restaurants popping up, Good Catch stands above them by maintaining quality seafood with quality sauce. 

I've been to the boil houses in California in which these restaurants are inspired by, and the key difference is most boil houses don't offer the quality seafood that the California counter-parts offer. Good Catch recognizes this distinction and maintains high quality offerings. 

Of course the 'seafood in bag' is the main attraction (catch my fav combo up top), but their oyster sliders are also delicious, along with the crab fried rice. 

Great for a group gathering or going out to watch a sporting event. Their bar is very underrated and the large number of tv's everywhere make it a great bar to watch the game. Plus they're open very late, so you'll be able to watch everything including the over time.

Although it is not a cheap adventure, you will not be disappointed by the offerings of this establishment.",2017-08-31 21:00:35

The reclaimed wood was a nice accent along with the brick walls and the lights remade from old fans. Real comfy inside.
Lets get to the food shall we. We all shared a plate full of nachos which were presented on a rectangular cookie sheet. We basically devoured them in plain sight of everyone, and wasn't ashamed of it either. For our entrees I chose the beet salad and my wife got the Brussels sprouts salad. I know, I know, who orders salad at a barbecue place? Sorry, but someone has to eat a little healthy now and then. My salad was good but a little small. It could have been bigger but the dressing was nice and the veggies were fresh. The Brussels sprouts salad was a nightmare. We were shocked they were raw. You have to cook them first so you don't break your teeth on them. I had a few bites as well as my wife and tossed the rest. They really should put them in the oven or fry them up first. Won't be getting that again. All n all a nice experience for our first time. I'm not going to let the Brussels salad damper the night.

In fact, we liked it so much that we have been here twice in the past week! Its a cute dessert cafe with a hip vibe. Sort of feels like you are somewhere in LA while you are here. So far, I have tried 3 items from their menu:

-Strawberry Cheesecake Shaved Ice: the shaved ice was very light and not too sugary. However, it also came with a generous amount of vanilla ice cream, cheesecake bites and strawberries. This one is definitely my favorite!

-Matcha Crepe Cake: never had a crepe cake before, but I did like the layers of the cake and how it was so light that you don't feel as guilty eating it! I would have preferred the matcha sauce to be a little more tasty, but overall I liked it.

-Honey Toast: haven't had this one for years and it was very good! I definitely feel guilty eating this one, but how can you resist warm toasted bread with honey, ice cream and condensed milk?

Loved the nice presentation of all their desserts and each one is big enough to share between 2 people. Don't expect fast service because it will take them a while to bring out your order. Also, this place is a little difficult to find since it is hidden at the end of a strip mall and you can't really see it from the street.

There are just so many options in town that are exceedingly better. That's not to say Pin Kaow isn't good, but it's just good, not amazing.

I came here with coworkers for lunch last week. They have some good lunch specials that come with soup and your choice of salad or eggroll and wonton. I decided on the pad thai with steamed tofu and salad. They gave me the option of steamed or fried tofu, love it! The soup was just ok, not really necessary. It lacked depth and flavor. My pad thai was a good size portion. Tasty and a solid dish. I wish the spice levels were better. My dish had no spice to it at all and I heard the same complaints from my tablemates. If I ever come again, I'll be ordering it much spicier. The salad was pretty good. I liked the dressing quite a bit, although they were a bit heavy handed with it.

I came in here a few months ago because I had to have a duplicate license made, since mine had gone missing. I thought this was going to be a quick procedure with no major flaws.

But once I got up to the counter, the woman who was waiting on me (a middle-aged red-haired woman) was extremely pretentious and rude, and contradicted information explicitly stated on the DMV web site. The site said you needed a state-issue picture ID and one of another form of ID. I had a Social Security card, which was one of said forms of ID. I brought EVERYTHING the web site had asked me to. And she said it wasn't good enough.

She started bitching at me, even though I explained that this was exactly what the website said. The customer is always right, you pretentious jerk. Apparently you didn't learn that when you went through customer service training - if you went through it at all. Eventually I was able to find sufficient ID in my wallet, but this woman was extremely rude all the while. If you're working at the DMV, you damn well better know what the website says, and uphold it. Just because you chose to work in a job with rude customers doesn't give you the right to be rude to me.

The facility itself is actually very nice and quite large, however even so it STILL manages to get overcrowded, and wait times for things like this are unbearable. I thought getting my duplicate license made would be a pretty painless procedure, and I'd be out of there in an hour, hour-and-a-half tops. It took OVER THREE HOURS. 

The parking is terrible, it is clear whoever invented this facility didn't know that LOTS of people go to a DMV. It isn't uncommon, as a result, to have cars illegally parked on the street. Furthermore, other neighboring shopping centers have begun putting up ""parking for customers only"" signs, so that is looking to be less of an option. It looks like construction has begun on another parking lot, but we'll see what happens.

Another annoyance is that you no longer get your renewed/duplicate license/permit during your visit - they have to mail it to you now. I liked being able to leave with my license in my pocket. Why change something that wasn't broken in the first place? 

This place either needs to be expanded or another DMV needs to be built in Henderson. And the bitchy woman that waited on me needs to be fired. Enough said.",2010-07-13 21:23:32

I was very disappointed in this place for so many reasons, the first being the short but rediculously SLOW line at the register.

Uhm, OK.....if I wanted to wait half an hour to eat I would've stayed home and cooked! Lame. So I ordered the Kahlua pork and my BF ordered the garlic chicken. 

Someone's nice grandma in house slippers delivered my lunch to the table. Just my plate. Call me crazy, but when two people sit down to eat, it's nice to have your meals brought out together, not 15 minutes apart. It really detracted from the whole date part of our lunch.

The Chipotle Steak Sammie (steak with cheese, chipotle, Cajun spices and fried egg on top) was alright. It was cheesy. The spices they used kind of made the sandwich taste a bit strange. The egg made it tolerable.

Maybe I love Lola because it's a cozy (sometimes crowded) place with communal seating. Maybe I love it because I'm nosy and like to engage random unknown people in deep conversation. Or maybe I just love simple and delicious food. 

Lola Tapas offers a limited menu that consists of favorites from Spain. The last time I was there myself and two pals had about 6 plates and a sangria for about 30 bucks each (that included tip). Is it pricey? Yes, but it is also well made and delicious. I highly recommend the fillet and and the tortilla de patatas. Do not go to Lola expecting Mexican dishes. An example is the tortilla is not a masa based flat bread. It's actually more of an omelet but not as ""eggy"". Just try it. You will be so glad you did. The ingredients are so fresh and well crafted, that it's hard to mess up here.

Our waiter was very friendly and quick. He even recognized me from my first visit. Any of the servers are there to help you so don't be afraid to ask any one of them for something. They all share gratuity so everyone is glad to help where they can.

I won't write too much about my love affair with Lola, but I do know that it will happen again and again. My devotion for Lola is strong. 

Grab a few good friends who are fellow foodies and visit Lola. Tell her I said hello!",2008-09-03 03:05:54

This review would be five stars for the damn service but the only ladies bathroom tonight is the ""guest showers"" so I'm knocking it down one star until I get a bathroom I don't have to get a damn hall pass (security escort) for.

I seriously gambled enough in the last two weeks to pay for a plumber to come and fix the women's bathroom or you could at least unlock the functioning but unused bathroom in Dennys so there is at least one working inside the actual casino.

Anyways, I come here pretty frequently to play. I lose, lose, lose but when I win, I win. Same with anywhere you play. Comps are decent but free play sucks compared to other Wildfires of the Station Brand. 

(On a Side note: I actually mentioned this in a Station Casinos post-gaming review and got an email back that said all free play is even across Wildfires but I still don't believe that to be true. I put a $20 in at Sunset or Wildfire and get the same $5 free play I get for my $400 at WWW.)

For the record right now, I'm Gold and my mother is Platinum. I'm usually Platinum and she's usually Chairman. We spread out our gambling (through Boyd, Harrahs & I gamble at SLS and local bars mainly) though so tiers always fluctuate.

Stayed once in a comp room, was clean, decently sized and they could probably charge an extra $40 a night if they got rid of the old ugly hutches that hold the tvs.

No room service, there's Dennys (good but mostly understaffed).

And like I said the staff is wonderful. I happily lose my money hanging out with Cina. She's amazing to watch serve and make drinks, rockin' hospitality to everyone that's thirsty.

The rest of the team in no particular order: Lisa, Gary, Tyler, Antoine, Rose, TG, John, Crystal, Thena and Kim all rock. 

Everyone makes you feel like you're welcome. I love it here but for fucks sake fix the bathroom. I have to pee, forgot my jacket, it's cold outside and that's what prompted my (would've been 5 star) review.",2017-03-05 05:07:41

I was less than impressed this time around even more so than my last visits and in between.

My little Sister and I were craving Sushi at 1am, they are open until 2am so we swung by on a Friday night. It was dead which was cool we just walked right up to the bar and sat.

We did not do AYCE as it was so late, we just wanted our sushi craving satisfied.

We ordered the special which is not on the menu, two full shrimp Tempura rolls, salad, and miso soup all for $11. A fantastic deal as a single roll cost more than that. We ate one roll and took one home for munchies later.

The service was OK, not really much service to be had unless you order AYCE.

Our sushi rolls were mostly rice, very little taste of the avocado, crab or shrimp, in which the roll is called ""Shrimp Tempura"". 

They have definitely downsized as far as product to rice roll portion. We really like the eel sauce, however we do not want to have to dunk it in just to add taste. Really tasted just like white rice with eel sauce. Consuming the roll solo was bland and flavorless.

I am disappointed as they used to be good.

A visit at 1am is not the best either as they close at 2am and start closing the sushi bar down and cleaning up so we did feel a bit rushed to eat and get the hell out of there.

A good deal in price is not a reason I would come back anytime soon.

I much prefer quality over quantity and price value. 

There is a reason they were dead on a Friday night as other sushi joints are poppin on a weekend!

If I recall, it was like 5 or 6 pieces compared with 1-3 that you get at other ramen places.  I also love the added bean sprouts and the corn in my soup. The ramen is priced at around $10-12 each and it was so yummy and filling. I'd totally give them a try if you haven't recently.

Enough anthropomorphizing the noodles though... the window into the kitchen to watch the noodles being made is such a cool feature! The dude I saw working the impossible noodle slinging had really impressive forearms... I'm sure he earned them from years and years of pasta wrangling.

This is the kind of under-celebrated hidden spot that is worth showing off... and picking up the tab will not hurt you dearly. I blew my roommate's mind by trotting this one out, although I had only been once a couple of years prior. What reminded me about this place was another friend raving about the potstickers. The pan-fried dumplings are huge... and essentially pure meat inside. The only ""filler"" is a smidge of green onion. Share these as an appetizer and then pound your delicious entrée (I had #22 - noodles and minced pork). And then the Oompah-Loompahs can roll you out the door afterward, because my friend, you will be stuffed blissfully full with noodle goodness!

Do yourself a favor and pool your couch change. Then come down here to see the Asian Popeye whip your noodles from fresh dough. Get the fried dumplings as big as your fist! Stuff an ungodly pile of steaming pasta down yer gullet! But you might want to wear a bib, if you're hesitant to cut your luxuriously long noodles.

However the bar with an open kitchen was cool and exciting to watch while waiting for your food being prepared. Moving on to the food we had.

Appetizers:
Cucumber Salad-Fresh and crisp cucumber and seasoned just right with a hint of spice. The dressing was like a cross of peanut butter and chili oil flavoring.
Beef Pancake-Juicy meat patty with a slight crisp paper texture that went well with the soy based sauced it came with.
Spicy Wontons-Balanced Flavor and texture. The spices went well with the soy garlic flavoring with chili oil.

Main Dishes:
Beef Shang Noodle Soup-Awesome broth and the hand pulled noodle was just right in texture.
Chicken & Mushroom Noodle-Good dish that was well seasoned and great alternative from their soup options.
Seafood Noodle Soup-Delicious and flavorful. The broth was balanced and not too salty.

I have never been so ticked off by a server in my entire life. The service provided by this server named Monica (as indicated on the receipt) in the outside area was just pathetic. 

Our friend arrived at the table early and got a table on the outside. But when we arrived, because we had our dog, we requested a different table where my dog could be better isolated from the rest of the crowd and the two other little puppies near by. The reason for this was that even though my dog is friendly but she loves food too much and she begs other people for food. When we asked for a different table, what we got was a sarcastic response from the host that ""well your server won't be (name)."" nevertheless, she reluctantly left all the menus and left. I was pretty annoyed by that response but decided not to let something like that messes up our perfect morning. 

Well that was just the beginning. Our server Monica was just awful. I don't think she knows how to smile. My mother asked if there was any breakfast entree, she snatched the menu from my mom's hands, turned it around and tapped on the menu to show her the two breakfast entree. I almost stood up in my seat to confront her but my mom kept me on my seat. I then said I am not ready to order yet because we just sat down, Monica just turned around and left. There was no ""I will give you guys a minute to decide."" 

The service remained laughably bad throughout. She only gave us two water even though we had a party of 3. I needed a coffee refill; I gotta ask someone else for it. I needed water refill; Glgotta ask someone else for it. I needed a change of your drink because a bug fell in it? I asked politely and she gave me a dirty look, turned around without saying a word. She then came back 5 minutes later with the drink and left it on my table without saying a word and then turned around and left. It was like if I was causing her the biggest trouble in the world. Never once did she come by check how we were doing like the other Brio servers would do normally. Never once did she come by to refill any of the drink we ordered. 

The only thing that stopped from me going to a manager just now is because we didn't want to mess up our perfect morning with a friend we haven't seen in awhile. But the more I think about her pathetic service, the angrier I get. Her service was unacceptable. 

My family is regular here and they said this was an isolated incident. But still this was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I am in disbelief that this type of service is allowed at a Brio resturant. I am reasonable so I will give one star for the good food and the other servers who were great at helping us becuase Monica couldn't. In all honesty, the experience deserved not a single star.",2017-05-13 22:20:17

Wasn't a fan of the Korean BBQ wings either; I thought the flavor was a bit too strong for me. But do try the hush puppies! They were very tasty and were the best part of the meal. All of the different components of the hush puppies worked really well together. For my entree, I ordered the Quebec burger, which was very salty, so I barely ate any of it. The restaurant itself is nice; it has high ceilings and the grilling area is right at the center of the restaurant, so you could pretty much watch your food getting made. I do hope to try Fire Side again, but only after they tone it down a little.

Over breakfast, I casually mentioned to my son....""How'd you like to fire a machine gun?""  ""Are you serious, dad?""

'Merica.  

We found these guys on yelp and they had some awesome ratings.  

We called and they sent a humvee to our hotel, free of charge.  Now this was no Dennis Rodman, pink, tricked out hummer.  This was a nasty, dusty old piece of crap left over from a few wars ago.  It was 105 degrees and we hopped in the back with no seat belts and cruised the back streets to the seedy underbelly of Vegas.  We passed strip clubs, massage parlors and homeless folks before arriving at their complex behind Circus Circus.  The building was decked out in camouflage and sand bags.  Kind of bad ass.  The parking lot was full of helicopters, tanks, jeeps and more hummers.  For $3500, you can drive an actual tank over a car and crush it.  This is legal?  Cool!

After arriving, we were escorted into the air conditioned building.  All of the employees were decked out in military-type uniforms.  They are all ex-military and they all look and act the part.  

Land of the free and home of guns.  Lots and lots of guns.  I have been with the Boy Scouts as a boy myself and then as a leader for my son's troop.  On those outings, we each fired a BB gun, a .22 rifle, a shotgun and a black powder rifle.  Pretty awesome but that is nothing compared to this insane place.  The choices here were endless.  You can see from one of my photos the package that we selected.  A Glock hand gun, a Remington 700 sniper rifle with scope, an MP5 machine gun and a Remington 870 shotgun.  For $159, plus $20 to split the package between two shooters, it seemed like a very fair price.  

The instructor hooks us up with goggles and ear protection.  The headset was badly needed as the shooting room was ridiculously loud without it.  Some of the guns were $26 per shell to shoot and the building shook when they were fired.

I tried their 2 Pc beef ribs with jalapeño hush puppies & cornbread.  Equally as good.  You don't even need the sauce, whatever their rub is..was very flavorful.

Decided to drive in early for bowling so I can give this place a try.  Seen & passed by for years when in this area.  I ordered the 1 piece cod w/sweet potato tater toys (combo incl. 2 fried shrimp) and I added a piece of spicy catfish.  Everything was seasoned well, good size portions, lightly breaded, Not Greasy and cooked perfectly.  They also serve BBQ meats, but I did not try that this time.  It's located in a strip mall next to the bowling alley.  Parking is limited, depending on the time of day you come.  The place is a small mom & pop place with about 8 tables.

The parking lot was surprisingly empty and I guess we now know why. My wife normally loves the tandori chicken but today it was EXTREMELY dry and unedible. We told our waiter about it and he takes the piece of dry chicken from our table and takes it to the back kitchen and seemed to tell the cook that the chicken was bad. Well, no follow up, no apology and he seemed to laugh it off with the female waitress that seemed to be flipping the dry pieces, just picking at them. I've kind of noticed the food was getting lower in quality lately, but didn't say much since it was my wife's favorite Indian lunch buffet. Even the solidly prepared mango lassi was full of ice pieces, didn't taste good and didn't arrive to the table until my plate was nearly finished. I didn't even go for seconds, since there really wasn't anything worth going back for. We have other choices for Indian food and next time it won't be here.

We went there as a big group and tried many different dishes from the menu. I had the kaleh-pacheh and it was perfect. The tongue was not lamb though, it was beef. Kaleh-pacheh is a persian delicacy but not everyone might like it. It is a stew with lamb organs. They do have other non-exotic and vegetarian dishes as well and they are all very good. Similar to the other locations by the owners (Anar and Shahrzad), the decoration and atmosphere is very nice and cozy and the staff is very friendly.

When walking into the restaurant, it doesn't seem like any special, or even similar to the pics you see posted. However, after walking around to see what this buffet has the offer, the layout and work they put into their display is above the standard places like Mandarin. 

Service here was spot on, but how can you screw up In a buffet right? They took our drink orders quickly and got back promptly. The dishes disappeared as we left for more food. The only gripe here is not taking away used tissues unless it was on the plate.

Food wise, the seafood variety was a bit lacking. Yes it has, raw oysters, scallops, conch shells, mussels and crab legs, but I feel they could do more. Especially since hey advertise as being a seafood buffet. The Japanese section was definitely exquisite. It had a huge variety of rolls, and the quality wasn't lacking either. The slices on sashimi were a bit thin though, making the taste differently. There was a DIY soba station, soups of many variety(thumbs up!), and the cooked section was definitely up there. This place's BBQ section seemed better than the seafood section, which appeases the western culture. 

I overall would recommend going to this place once for special occasions, but definitely not worth traveling for.",2015-10-18 18:03:08

I appreciate that they've made an effort to use healthier ingredients and offer lower calorie options. The ambiance is quite loud, but it does say factory in the name and the ceilings are high. It is old world style decor and somewhat darker inside. It tends to be clean, but I've gotten sticky menus on occasion which I do not like at all. The menus are books and probably hard to keep up with when they're busy, which they are often. 

I typically enjoy my food here. It is consistent. You always know what you're getting. The food and beverage selections are vast. The service is usually good. The portions have shrunk over the years. This probably had to do with having to list calorie counts in the menu. They'd be astronomical otherwise. What I don't understand is why the prices are so dang high. The value is poor. We dine and drink out frequently, but we don't come here often because of the bill at the end. You can get great food elsewhere for much better prices and service overall.",2018-04-28 22:14:39

i came back here a day before mother's day, there was 4 of us. we figured we gate crowds so made a reservation properly a month ahead. we got there and was at at the booth by the bar. we order: rock shrimp, of course, and the new tuna tartare, pretty good, full of flavours and texture. we enjoyed the apps ... it took nearly 40 minutes for the remainder of our food to come. we ordered the wagyu steak and the beef fried rice. yes, the fried rice was just as great as i remember, especially now that we've been waiting for so long - the steak was mediocre. it definitely was not worth the $42 we paid, it wasn't good at all. lastly came the yam tempura. yes the yam tempura came last and not full cooked. 

we were not satisfied at all. i saw the manager and very very nicely said that i wanted to provide some feedback and next time they should really make an effort to not keep customers waiting. he did apologize said he would offer us dessert, we declined. there was no reason for us to want to stay any longer. 

note. their main area was NOT full. manager explained there was a party upstairs they were serving. so does that mean the rest of your orders get neglected? what do you do when the entire dining room is at full capacity? 

the server did the best he could considering the circumstances. he took the yam tempura off the bill and apologized. said i didn't have to tip him, but i did, of course. 

all things considered, we did not feel we were valued as customers. especially seeing as we sat for over an hour for out food. we never saw or heard from the manager again when we were leaving, nor when the food finally. i expected it more from kasa moto, especially being a restaurant in Yorkville.",2017-05-16 20:48:43

We also wanted to try some non-dim sum dishes so we ordered the rainbow crystal (?), which is the dish you get after peking duck... with the iceberg lettuce filled with minced pork and goodness. It was pretty good though although I've had better elsewhere. Lastly, we got the standard Yeung Chow fried rice which was good as well but again not the best I've had as some of it was clumping a little bit.

I really like the original burger sliders and the pulled pork sliders. I also enjoy the boneless hot wings. Other than that, my experience has not been very good.

Service is pretty good most of the time. Tonight it took at least ten minutes after being seated to be greeted. Our waitress did apologize and she look stressed so I felt for her. We ordered the pepperjack cheese dip with tortilla chips. It was not good. It was pretty much velveeta heated up in a cup and the chips were extremely stale, tasted like they had been sitting around for at least a month in an opened bag. I ordered the french dip sandwich for my entree (see attached pic). It looked pretty good. Looks can be deceiving. It was bad. The beef tasted off. Like beef that had been sitting around too long. Very unappetizing. After two bites I was done. All of the food in general looked old and not at all fresh tonight. A huge turn off. If our dinner was this bad, how bad was the food in kitchen? Just an all around bad experience tonight.

The greatest value comes from the amazing FREE concerts! Every year there's a good lineup and yes, you can get in FREE with your paid fair admission!

The biggest downsides of the fair are what you'd expect: parking runs anywhere from $15 - $25. The food stands inside should be ashamed of the outrageous prices they charge (think $27 for a turkey leg, $10 for a funnel cake, $7 fried Oreos, $8 for a small cup of lemonade) but they serve great ""fair food."" The rides are your typical carnival rides and lines aren't too bad UNLESS YOU GO AT NIGHT. Again, try to avoid the fair at night, especially on weekends! If you can go midweek during the day, you'll have a much better time. There are lots and lots of midway games with fun prizes (but bring cash, you're gonna need it)!

The fair grounds are large and spacious, and they pack a lot of stuff into the area. With all this space, you'd think they'd provide more shady areas or places to sit and relax -- these coveted spots are few and far between. If you eat, you're going to eat standing up in the sweltering desert sun. 

The livestock exhibits are always fun to peruse and there's a small petting zoo for kids (extra fee to do this). The exhibit halls kind of blow, they are mostly filled with vendors for mattresses and ""as seen on t.v."" junk. The prize winner exhibits are fun and these was some great photography in the contest this year. Money saving tip: check online for cool events, freebies and giveaways the day of your visit!

This place also delivers but if you get the noodles it may not be a good idea because the noodles get hard and rubber like.

I ordered the Sweet and Spicy Basil entree and the Spicy Green Bean entree (yes, I needed two entrees after this particular Saturday evening).

I walked in expecting to see something like on TV but nope... Here's a tatted up ginger flinging noodles.  I laughed out loud at myself ""stereotype shattered"".   In fact, I thought it was so funny I commented to the waiter who was lighthearted himself. Turns out the person making the noodles was teaching another guy how to do it.  

Now the rest:
1. Super clean
2. Very reasonably priced
3. Great Service
4. I ordered beef noodle.  Great savory broth. Love the fresh cilantro. Meat seemed like short rib & could have used a little more cooking but still tasty but not quite that tender to falling apart.
5. Big portion.  I ate half and took the other half to go. Reheat was great so basically I got 2 meals for under $10

It's in a strip mall so parking was tight when I arrived but cleared out 15 minutes later when the nail salon next door was closing up.  There's a McDonalds next door with big lot and no signs saying ""McD parking only"" so that was fine.

yjeiByq6PUwCD-ggZaBZNA,0-UxxxWLz1muOzPx2F3-kQ,zwNLJ2VglfEvGu7DDZjJ4g,2,0,0,0,"Went to Arriba Mexican Grill the other day for lunch w/ my wife and son.  We went late (about 3 pm), and the place was nearly empty.  

Let me start this review by saying that I read many of the reviews posted by other Yelpers, and we have had many of the same experiences w/ this place.  All of our bad experiences in the past were do to very poor customer service.  When I read about the grouchy greeters and the surly servers, it was like a trip back in time.  

At one point, back around 2000-03; we were going to Aribba 2, sometimes 3 times per week.  We were regulars, but never treated as such.  Same snotty greeters and servers who wanted to be somewhere else.  We liked the food, and there were a couple of servers that were very good at their jobs.  This is why we kept going back.  Unfortunately, it just got to the point that the good servers were replaced by poor ones.  We stopped going, and went to Ajo Al's instead.

On to the present.  We decided to give Arriba a try after a self imposed exile of about 6 years. 

New greeters, however same old problem...not welcomed, greeter and server at hostess station talking about who knows what.

We were seated, and chips, salsas, and bean dip were brought out quickly.  Fortunately, the chips were hot and fresh.  The bean dip was good, w/ a little spice in it.  The mild salsa didn't do much for me, but the hot salsa was favorable, and was good when mixed w/ the bean dip.

Our server was quick and efficient, and brought our drinks out quickly.  I ordered the lunch chimi, my wife ordered the lunch poco pollo con queso, and Jr. had his usual bean and cheese burrito.  

The food did come hot and fast.  I ordered the red chile chimi w/ red enchilada sauce, and substituted the black beans for refried.  The red chile was good; rich w/ good flavor.  The rice was the standard affair, nothing to write home about.  The black beans were good, but just a tad bit watery.  

The only complaint I had was the size of the chimi.  It looked like it was a deep fried enchilada, not a burrito.  I understand that I ordered off the lunch menu, but this thing was tiny!  For almost $10.00, I expected a little more (like Ajo Al's, or Valle Luna).

My wife liked her dish, but it was also on the small side.

Jr. loved the bean and cheese burrito (for the most part, he's pretty easy).

With many other options for Mexican food in the north Glendale area, I'm not sure if/when we'll be back.  The service was good, the chips and salsa were good, even the main part of the meals were good; but the very small entree size won't bring me back anytime soon.

Arriba likes to make the claim of using Hatch chiles, and having New Mexico style food.  If you really want to try some New Mexico style food, I suggest Si Señor in Chandler, or Los Dos Molinos in Phoenix. In my opinion, both of these restaurants out do Arriba Mexican Grill by a long shot.

The sides were delicious however his very expensive steak was dry and flavorless. He chocked down half and we took the other half home to the dogs.

PROS
-Variety of Cleveland-isms. CLE Clothing goes beyond your basic 'I heart CLE' and 'Cleveland Rocks' shirts and gives you memorabilia and souvenirs that touch on even the smallest Cleveland detail. West Side Market, Dead Man's Curve, every and all CLE sports, Playhouse Square, the Guardians...I could go on. Our last trip there I got a 'Cleveland Foodie' shirt and a CLE iPhone case. They have it all.

-Breadth of products. They are constantly putting out new items and, as I mentioned, there is always a variety!

-Price. Some wouldn't pay $25 for a t-shirt, but I think that it's worth it for the quality and the meaning of the shirt. Not to mention, you're supporting local businesses in the process. They also have a lot of promotions so just follow them on social media if you want to buy during one of their many deals.

CONS
-My only complaint is regarding the space. It can get pretty packed in the small store, especially since it is in a prime location on E4th St. My recommendation would be to check it out on a non-game or non-concert day.

BOTTOM LINE
-If you love Cleveland, you should definitely own something from this store!",2015-11-22 15:39:16

We got the 808 Special Mix Plate where you get to pick two meats, rice and mac for $9.50. We picked sesame chicken and shoyu chicken. 

It's not as fast as other mixed plate places. That I suppose is can be a good thing since it's freshly cooked. We had some poke to nosh on from Poke Express anyways while we waited. 

We bit into the sesame chicken and I thought it was supposed to have sauce so we asked if we can have some sauce. They said they were out of the sesame sauce...er, okay, thanks for letting us know when we got our order. I never had sesame chicken so I don't quite know now what it's really supposed to taste like. We asked for some katsu sauce then since it just needed something to dip the fried chicken in. Their katsu sauce is more tangy, almost ketchup-y compared to other places I've gone to. The shoyu chicken is 2  bone in thigh and it reminds me of Filipino adobo, but sweeter since it stews in the shoyu. The mac is interesting in that it has potato, and tuna in it...it's pretty good to me, but for some people who like plain mac might not be into it. 

Overall the place was an okay place to get plate lunch. I'm very curious how their lau lau and kalua pork stack up. Til next time- 3.5 stars.",2010-07-12 07:56:32

The fusion dishes are one of a kind. I even saw a bento box served with sushi rolls and beef sliders - that rocks. 

You no longer have to worry about where to go the next time your in the mood for sushi and your friend doesn't eat raw fish. This is the place.

Their ramen is on par with ramen heavyweights such as Santouka and Kinton.  I'd say it's a three way tie if Raijin were to go up against them.

Service was solid, though not everything was smooth. My husband ordered a beer, and I tried to order a strawberry cocktail--but was informed they were out of the liquor. I guess the weekend drained their supply! I settled for water.

Our appetizer of Whiskey Rose torpedoes came out quickly and they were quite good. I can't handle a lot of heat, but I found the torpedo quite tasty... then found the spiciness right by the stem! Quite good nevertheless. I'd eat these again.

My husband had a Saloon Burger. It was cooked perfectly to his specifications. The fries were good, too.

Our son had the kid meal macaroni and cheese with fries. He quite enjoyed his food, too, and it was the perfect amount for him.

I had the rib tips with green veggie and cornbread. When I ordered, I asked what the green vegetable was today and was told it was broccolini. I was surprised to see a squash medley instead, but I liked it just fine. The rib tips were perfectly cooked, not dried out. I gave about half to my husband and they met his approval, too.

The most disappointing thing was the cornbread muffin. If you look at my picture, it's that dark, shriveled thing at about the 11 o'clock position on my plate. I'm guessing it had been kept warm under foil or in some other warm humid environment. When I tried to cut into it, it literally crumbled in my hand. The pieces were on the verge of being mushy.

They have a sommalier who helped us choose wine and beer. He suggested a Malbec with my stew. I was skeptical because I've never had what I considered to be a good Malbec. Usually, it's too weak-tasting for me. Surprise! The Malbec here was very complex and rich...changed my mind entirely about Malbec.

E5vf5YKe2R2Bz3BT3pLlOQ,WfZFj0OH9tuOdxEfSaM1vA,_mg5bYknpZgaWSfjQVmrJQ,5,2,0,1,"My husband, son, daughter and I had an early dinner Monday evening at Spinato's. 
My daughter has Celiac Disease and Spinato's is one of the few restaurants that takes precautions in the kitchen--keeping her food from cross contamination.

We were greeted immediately upon walking in by the hostess whom was busy seating another couple; she told us she would be right with us. 

While we were waiting, another couple came in and asked us if Spinato's is the ""best in Phoenix""? My daughter and I replied: Yes they are. I explained about my daughter's Celiac Disease. I added that Spinato's is careful with her food and that they have gluten free options on their menu.
 
Upon being seated, I went to use the restroom. The restroom is very clean and tidy--this is important in restaurants we dine at--it speaks volumes about the restaurant itself.
Our waiter Jordan arrived as my husband, son and I joined my daughter at the table. 
He took our drink order and quickly returned with them to the table. I ordered an ice tea, my husband-water and my daughter and son had Pepsi. My tea was perfect--again it tells me that the staff knows how to make ice tea, as some places I have visited have either really watered down tea or its too strong. After giving us time to peruse the menu, Jordan took our order. My husband and I ordered off the happy hour menu Jordan had given us. We decided on the chicken wings-bone in, mild buffalo sauce and a small two item pizza with pepperoni and mushroom. My daughter ordered the turkey pesto sandwich on gluten free bread. It comes with kettle chips and a crispy pickle. My son ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce.

We didn't have to wait very long before the food arrived. The hot wings (6) half-dozen, were hot, fresh and delicious with just the right amount of sauce and spice to them. On the side were crispy carrots and celery. We had blue cheese to dip them in. Our pizza was fabulous as usual. Spinato's has a unique sauce that has a little bit of sweet to it-yummy. The pizza was crispy and good. My son's spaghetti with meat sauce arrived in a bowl with a nice slice of garlic bread. He enjoyed every bite of it. My daughter's turkey pesto sandwich was flavorful. The turkey was tender and moist. 

Jordan was very attentive. He checked on us often and made sure everything was OK. He refilled our drinks and he cleared away our dishes. I think he should be recognized because he works really hard for his customer's. I want to return and ask for him so we can be seated in his area of the restaurant. I could tell he likes his job and cares about his customers. 

After Jordan had already cashed out our bill, I decided to order the cannoli for dessert. It had cream and chocolate chips inside of it. It was crispy on the outside. It was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. 

We will definitely be returning in the near future. We love Spinato's. They make you feel welcome and like family when dining there.",2017-03-07 20:30:07

Like Chotchkie's, the fictional restaurant from ""Office Space,"" sometimes people come to a restaurant for the atmosphere and the attitude. Never mind that the food is astonishingly mediocre.

Hate to break the news, but Chuy's is the Chotchkie's of Tex-Mex restaurants. Lots of kitschy atmosphere, plenty of chirpy attitude (seriously, some of the waitstaff here act like they're spending the last few months of a prison sentence at a halfway home), and the food is simply very bland. And Tex-Mex should NEVER be bland. 

Look, I don't dislike Chuy's, but it feels a lot like what you get when you go to a joint like Chili's or Outback; a so-called ""authentic"" and ""real"" atmosphere that's anything but. For what they're charging you - no kidding, this is some seriously expensive Tex-Mex - you're definitely not getting your money's worth.

It was maybe about a year ago or more when I decided to stop going because every time I tried one of their iced coffee drinks, it wasn't that cold...you had to shake the ice around a bunch just to get it to chill a bit.

A few weeks ago, after receiving some coupons in the mail, I decided what the heck - let's give it another go. I gotta say I was really impressed. I went with my usual fave - Iced Chai w/ non-fat and sugar free vanilla (i know, when did I turn in to such a yuppie, but damn is it good!). It had the perfect amount of sweetness and just enough spice (unlike the chai at Starbucks - way to spicy). 

The next day I tried the Milky Way Freeze (i think that's what it's called). Very good, however I'm scared to think of how fattening it is because it comes in a pre-made blend. Oh well, I'll deal with it, because it really was tasty.

And this morning I tried a Strawberry Red Bull Smoothie. Eh - I'll pass on this next time. It was more of an Icee than a smoothie, and had a bit of a weird taste. To each his own.

The staff are always really friendly and upbeat. It doesn't matter what time it is, they have the music blasting and look like they are having a good time. 

The only down side I can see of this place are the cups they use. They are definitely not made to sit back and relax. Within a half an hour or so you can feel the material of the cup start to get soggy. So if you slam your coffee, this isn't an issue, but if you like to savor it, I might recommend asking for 2 cups.

This place is MAGIC. I've never been anywhere like it before- they pride themselves on making their own noodles in-house, and there's a even a big window into the kitchen where you can watch them do what they do. Take a look, it's kinda cool to watch.

They offer five styles of noodle, and so far I've tried two of them- both were delicious. The noodles were perfect- and I say perfect in a way that I really can't say 'perfect' very often. Equally chewy and firm, such a nice flour-flavour that absorbs whatever sauce (or soup) they're bathing in. For an appetizer, we had the cold sliced tendon. My girlfriend ordered the shaved noodles with spicy sauce, and I had the 'B' noodles in a beef soup. First, the tendon. It was thin-sliced and cooked in a delicious sesame oil sauce with seared chilies, over a bed of vinegared daikon and carrots. Scooping up some of the veggies in the folds of the tendon (to make sort of a taco), the textures and flavors work INCREDIBLY well together. The vinegar from the veggies and the sesame spiciness of the tendon is just AMAZING, and makes for GREAT leftovers. The noodle dishes were delicious as well- I really can't say enough great things about them.

So, as far as the haters:

People complain about the service here. It's an authentically Asian restaurant, and employs authentically Asian employees. Asian table manners and service styles are different from other ethnicities. It's not that we're being rude, we just don't tend to 'hover' like American servers do. Sometimes you'll need to wave us over- why is that a problem? When we go to American restaurants we get annoyed by how much attention the servers dote on us- it seems almost condescending and suffocating. So if that's a problem for you, then you need to either stick with Panda Express (please note:  I am NOT hating on my PE), or spend a little bit more time around Asians and stop getting so butthurt.

As far as the 'different' flavours- yeah, they might not work for you, but kudos for trying something new! This place doesn't crystallize their food with MSG, so it probably won't pack the same punch as you're used to with your General Tso and Happy Family from down the street. But try it out- actually take time to appreciate the flavours instead of worrying so much about what it 'doesnt' taste like.

Kids under 12 were free- score x 2 for me and my two kids. The various taco stands  only accept tokens that you buy at the entrance. Kind of lame, how are you supposed to guess how many tacos and beverages you want ahead of time??  

The venue closed at seven pm, and we arrived about 330pm. There must have been at least 5000 people of all ages looking for tacos. That's a first for me. Surprisingly, literally one hundred percent of the stands we went to had only one or two types of tacos left, everything else was sold out. What the heck! Full price admission should equal fully stocked items. Some if the lines were 15 minutes long, ridiculous for a two dollar taco.  

The big downer though, was the inconsistent quality of the tacos.  The vendors were just too busy. Since it was me and my family, we ordered four of each taco- that all looked different. Some were over filled, others were undefiled.   One had sauce, they other didn't.  You get the picture.  

What did stand out? Everyone, guests included, was friendly and having a good time. Restrooms were plentiful. Parking free.  Kids free. Bottled water was reasonably priced. An abundance of vendors. Live music. Hence my difficulty with giving it a two star review. Ultimately the lack of consistent taco prep and running out of the majority of tacos is the downfall. The Phoenix food scene has grown a lot since moving here in 1999. The taco festival needs to grow up.",2015-10-19 06:11:29

We arrived at 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon and surprisingly the place was more than half full.  My Uncle ordered a flight and was disappointed that there were no stouts or stout-like beers amongst the offerings.  I ordered a root beer, and guess what, no root (birch) beer.  Wah wah!

My Uncle got a bowl of onion soup and pierogies, my Aunt (I am apologizing as I write this) ordered the Pittsburgh salad, and I ordered the quinoa salad.  I think of the three, my Uncle got the best lunch.  The pierogies are an appetizer but he received a fair number and he said they were v. good, along with the soup.  The Pittsburgh salad was the same as any salad you could get in any bar in Pittsburgh and at $17.50, severely overpriced.

My guinoa salad was a huge disappointment.  Quinoa was a garnish not the star.  The ""mixed greens"" were nearly all iceberg lettuce with a few v. small pieces of spinach.  There were about a teaspoon of corn and a teaspoon of black beans and about 6 grape tomatoes cut in half along with a few pieces of onion.  The ""dressing"" was about 8 dots around the plate.  So the salad was dry.  This was $13.50, again not especially tasty and overpriced.

Next time I will stick to the buffalo meatloaf, which really is quite good.

Love how you can donate a book and they will match those books.  They have flavored coffee samples up front too.

Though I did like the food, I thought the service here was just odd. They have an assembly line where each staff seems to have a set station but it's extremely unorganized and inefficient. I also think the ordering system here is plain confusing. I don't know if it's just me but I had a hard time figuring out how to order or what to get. Also didn't help because I'm at one station ordering a sandwich and a staff at a soup station is already asking me what soup I'm ordering. ""Would you like some soup today?""...""Sorry I'm still deciding."" 

Then 20 seconds later, ""Would you like some soup today?"" ""WOULD YOU LIKE SOME SOUP TODAY?"" ....Holy moly, how many times are you going to ask me? Calm down soup server. I'm not ready yet.  I guess it is my fault for not knowing what I want on my first visit? Then come to the register and we are met with a rude cashier. Ugh.

On the bright side, our food was fantastic. We got kale and quinoa salad, cuban grilled pork panini sandwich, wild mushroom bisque and asian citrus chicken salad. Salads were drenched in dressing so I did not like it too much. However, I did enjoy the sandwich and mushroom soup. 

Cuban grilled pork had a smoky taste to it. Panini was thin and sandwich was a small portion but I loved the flavor. Small bite and I was instantly in love. One bite kept me wanting another. Mushroom soup was rich and creamy, wish it had more mushroom in it instead of few small pieces. I got to try a sample of tomato basil soup and that was one of the best soup I had. Wish they sell it by gallon.

Today they offered the Chinese new year menu so they didn't even present their regular menu. We found our waitress abrupt but attentive. Could just be the way she spoke. 

WE like the cream pumpkin soup the best.  The soup is very smooth and the corn kernels provide some sweetness. There's a surprise element with the crunchiness from the white fungus. 

The fruit salad was just okay. While it was nicely presented and we liked the dumplings, the salad itself was lackluster- mainly all you could taste was the nice sour and sweetness of the dressing but the fruits (dragon fruits and melons) flavour was lacking

I do like the 2 stir fry dishes with the shan Yao and the unknown type of fungus that smells like truffle. The asparagus add a nice touch but I would like to have more shan Yao please lol...

We were not so sure about the fry rice in the lotus leaf. According to the waitress, they make the fry rice first, then steam it in lotus leaf. I don't know why they'd do that second step because the steaming process totally change the texture of the fry rice and the whole dish just taste like regular rice dish...soft and gooey- not that it's not good, but just that when you order fry rice you expect the bouncy texture of individual rice grain on your tongue lol

For dessert we got the red bean soup which is a free given. We tried to see if we could try their other dessert (and willing to pay) but tonight they only had one type left.

I was thrilled when she said she'd take me to Life is Beautiful. I'd never been and for sure couldn't afford the high ticket prices. 

Day 1 Friday -Had an incredibly hard time finding parking our original plan of parking at the Stratosphere and taking a cab in were dashed when we saw their garage and valet were full. So we drove around downtown and ended up paying $20 to park at the Fremont St parking garage. At least it wasn't to far a walk to 7th St. They checked my backpack and let us in. We walked down to 9th St and found food cause we were hungry. I first spotted Culinary Dropout. We both got the pretzel balls with provolone cheese sauce and I had a rib too! Both were delish. The rib fell off the bone and was perfectly cooked. We each got 6 pretzel balls and a ton of cheese sauce. Mmmmmm! We checked out the Ambassador stage while we sat on the cool grass on my blanket. We were kinda tired already so we walked over and visited the pink fuzzy wall and the EDM stage was in full effect. Loved the fire shooting out with the beat of the music. Next we came across the Strip Cheese truck which we mentally noted for the next day. We wondered around to the Huntridge stage and then decided to leave for the day. 

Day 2 Saturday- Instead of paying another $20 for parking my husband Joel was sweet enough to drop us off and pick us up. On this day we were supposed to meet up with our other Yelp friends that had won tickets Jessica and Niyen, but due to crappy cell service we just missed each other. So Jessie and I decided to get food before the Roots came on stage. Strip Cheese was calling our names. Jessie and I decided to share what we got. So she ordered the Hangover and I got the Triple Parley. The Hangover was on a soft pretzel roll, summer sausage, mustard, and a beer cheese sauce. Omg yum!! The Triple Parley was excellent too! It had three cheeses and was perfectly melted on crisp sourdough bread. We wondered over to the downtown stage to check out the Roots. Jessie wanted something sweet so we checked out the Aloha Kitchen booth and she got Honey Toast. At this point a text came through on my phone from Jessica! I told her where we were at, but didn't hear anything back. So we waited for a bit and then I had to give in and use a port a potty. As we were heading that way what do ya  know we ran into Jessica! Yay!! It was decided we were all going to ride the Ferris wheel. Let me tell you I'm a total wimp when it comes to rides, but I was determined to try. After waiting in line during Lionel Richie we got on. Omg so not fun. The whole thing moved and after three times around I was ready to get off!! Thank goodness for Jessica she flagged the ride operator down and got him to let me get off. We all gathered afterwards on my blanket and watch Outkast who totally rocked! They were amazing!! I couldn't stop dancing in spite of my feet hurting. This was a great night at the festival. 



Sunday- yay!! Foo Fighters day!!! We arrived around 6pm this night and again my husband dropped us off and picked us up. This time we met up with Jessica right away. I gave her my blanket and she headed over to our spot under the Ferris wheel to set up a base camp. Meanwhile Jessie and I met up with Niyen and walked over to the ambassador stage to see A-Trak. He was an amazing DJ! He actually mixed stuff and did not use a computer. Our feet were hurting so we headed over to our spot. We saw the Arctic Monkeys who were ok. Finally the band I'd waited ALL weekend for the Foo Fighters!! They rocked hard! Playing songs from all albums and a ton of covers which I loved! I also really loved that the Foo Fighters thanked Life is Beautiful for letting them play. Super classy!!

With all the people this festival was super organized and I loved they had lots of water fill up stations and plenty of bathrooms. 
A couple things I did not like about the event. The parking sucks and really shouldn't have been so much. There was several art displays, but I was thinking we'd get to watch the artists as they were creating their pieces. I also thought there would have been more art over all. 

By the third day I was worn out! This was an amazing experience and I was so happy to spend it with some of my closest Yelp friends. Thanks to Yelp and Nate for giving out some amazing tickets! Some sweet memories were made at Life is Beautiful! Peace and love!",2014-10-30 05:13:25

So, the food is down home delicious cooking. I cannot complain here AT ALL. I do recommend coming here for lunch if you want some comfort food. 
The Prices are super reasonable. The crowd is laid back. No Scottsdale pop your collar crowd here - late 20s to 50s to families (during the day). The service? Meh. Again, years ago it was one of the things I liked about this place. People hustled! 

For me? It feels like a bad break up. The nostalgia is gone and I am not sure what to do with them anymore. If you're in Chandler and want to EAT and drink, I say try it out. Oh, and Dos Gringo's in next door when you're over it.",2013-01-05 06:52:12

Their prices are not as bad as Whole Paycheck's (I mean Whole Foods), and the quality of their produce is good.  If you're into decadence, they've got that too (over the holidays try their chocolate covered jo-jos!)

If you eat a raw/whole food/vegan diet like I do sometimes (the mood comes and goes these days) you can get some decent stuff here: raw nuts, raw almond butter, Ezekiel bread. I sometimes get almond or soy milk here as well.  I come here every week for a stack of salads that I'll eat at work.

The dishes here are packed full of flavor and creativity. It reminded me of a homier, more affordable version of Cheesecake Factory pasta plates. The half portions allow you to indulge in more than one plate if you want to mix it up. I love gouda so I tried the Sweet Home Alabama, which is mac and cheese in creamy gouda topped with bacon, onions, and popcorn chicken drizzled with barbecue sauce. I loved every bite.

For a cold noodle dish, I tried my friend's One Night in Bangkok, which is their take on Thai rice noodles with chicken. The noodles were cooked spot on and I loved the sweet chili sauce. If that isn't spicy enough for you, try the Nights in White Satin - the red pepper really gives a kick in your mouth. Enjoy some classic 80s rock while consuming your meal.

On one hand, it's a good option if you want to grab drinks in a casual environment without worrying about lines or cover. However, it doesn't really serve as a replacement for the club and it's definitely lacking the lounge atmosphere. 

Despite not fitting into one specific category, the Bourbon Room still manages to draw a crowd. I think it's a combination of the loud 80s music videos, strong drinks and easy accessibility from the casino floor.  

The Bourbon Room definitely caters to a specific niche market and more specifically fans of 80s music. As a result, the crowd reflects this with many patrons in the 30s and 40s. I found crowd to be carefree and non-judgmental. Unlike the club, people weren't there to be seen or to pick-up. They were just there to relax and have fun.'

Another thing I liked about the Bourbon Room was its energy. They have an emcee/host who jokes around, introduces songs and gets guests involved in contests in exchange for free drinks or show tickets. It can be extremely entertaining or also annoying depending on your mood. 

Overall, it's not a bad place to grab a drink for a more low-key night. If you're staying at the Venetian or Palazzo, I doubt you'll miss it.",2014-04-04 01:23:13

I have to say my last two visits to this location has sucked spiky balls, not soft and warm ones! So after a night out of party time with the ladies we stopped through to grab a bite. We placed our order and wanted two apple pies which are boldly advertised on their menu and signs. 

The cashier tells us they have none ready, so we ask can they be made or is it just not an option? The cashier informs they could be made and would take ten minutes to make. Ok so we passed on it and drive up to the window to pay for our order.

We sit at the drive thru after paying for 15 minutes waiting on our order. We ordered four items so I would hate to know how long the wait would have been for a large order. I told my friend had I known it would have taken 15 minutes for our order anyways then I would have ordered the Apple pies for us.

No apology for our wait, the cashier literally shoves my friend our bag of food and shuts the window. We wait and ask for ketchup and I swear this troll rolled her eyes at us and hands us the ketchup packets.

It's a cool place for perhaps meeting friends for a drink but the food is overpriced for the quality--at least for the veggie burger.

I should have asked first, but I didn't, and go figure, the fries are frozen (ie, not hand-cut). Personally, I feel, restaurants at this price range should be serving hand-cut fries standard.

---------------------
Thank you Savour Mississauga and Yelp for helping me discover new/hidden restaurants in my neighbourhood.  I went here as part of the Savour Mississauga event in a Yelp group.  When I walked into the restaurant, I was thinking ""umm..this place is so nice and so formal, do I even belong here with my lack of table manners, my penchant for eating anything and everything no matter how it tastes and my lack of fine dining cuisine knowledge?""  Well, I still haven't figured that out, but the staff was so friendly so at least they made me feel like my business was wanted.  

Anywho, enough about me, ordered the $35 prix-fixe menu and had:

FOOD: 5/5
-ANTIPASTO AUTUNNO 
The salami was okay, but what really added some amazing flavours was the grilled Polenta and Scarmoza cheese.  The light saltiness of the plate really got my tastebuds going and helped me appreciate what was to come.  Beautiful presentation. 5/5

CAIFORNIA CUT STEAK & SHRIMP (SURF & TURF)
I love my steak and like it medium rare.  This was probably a perfect medium rare, but I did find it slightly salty.  Not a big deal.  What I really appreciated though was the mushroom cream sauce. It added some flavour, without overpowering the natural steak flavour.  I prefer my steaks to have very light flavouring so I can tell the freshness and quality of the meat.   The shrimp was not bad.  Believe it or not though, my fave part  was the potatoes.  I don't know what it was about it, but I could have eaten more of these.  4.5/5


STRAWBERRY CHESSECAKE TART
Sweets are my enemy!!!  Yucky aftertaste, make me fat, give me sugar highs and lows, etc, however this was a dessert that I wouldn't mind befriending.  It wasn't too sweet, but had great flavours.  The tart was nice and crisp, and the icing/whip cream wasn't too heavy either and you could taste each component of the tart.  

AMBIANCE: 5/5 - Amazing place to take a date or any special occasion. 

PRICE: 4/5 - honestly, all of us ordered off the Savour Mississauga prix fixe menu with the exception of one person . He had calamari and liver and they were $11 and $20 respectively for very healthy sized portion and I got the impression from him it was really good.  So really, pricing is probably equivalent to The Keg or slightly cheaper.  

So definitely a hidden gem here and for Savour Mississauga - 5/5.  However, as we were part of a Yelp group, I'm not sure if we were given any special treatment, so the next part is about freebies. 

---------------------
DISCLAIMER: Extra's we may have received because it was a Yelp event as well, while the above is just Savour Mississauga. 

SERVICE: 5/5 - I am sure there service is excellent for everyone else, but I wanted to put it in this section. We were given some freebies:

-Champagne
-Deconstructed panzella salad with mozarella.  Very fresh veggies and interesting mixes of flavours and texture
-Homemade biscotti - I loved this.  I think there was a lemon one and a Nutella one.  I thought the Nutella one was a bit too sweet, but the lemon one was so soft and even tasted good without coffee.  When I have biscotti, I usually have to dip it in coffee to soften the texture, but both of these were very soft and the lemon one had a nice tangy sweetness to it.

oy0RvMsKImjRhGlGJMRlmg,pUx11DEcips6PLW157WdDw,DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw,5,5,3,4,"Here's a little recap of our Saturday night at Roka Akor.

Reservation @ 9pm for an entourage of 5, and we were seated in 1 of their 2 ten-people private dining rooms (the 2 rooms can be connected for larger groups). The contemporary decor is just as beautiful as one would expect from a high-end restaurant: spacious, warm red-wood floor with light brown leather chairs, huge open kitchen and a separate bar area. Our private dining room features elm-wood on 1 side (which artistically disguise numerous storage shelves.), and red mud wall on the other.

The menu was... big. After spending 10 minutes flipping pages, picked a couple selections here and there, then forgot what we had chosen at the first place, we gave up and asked for suggestions. I'll try to recall everything that we ordered. Octopus Salad, Lamb cutlets, Duck breast, Short ribs, Rice hot-pot, Chicken on skewers (Yakitori), Sashimi platter (3 kinds), Spicy chicken wings, Grilled mushroom (I think it was Hiratake mushroom), Vegetable tempura.

Octopus salad and Grilled mushroom were on Chef's Choice menu. The salad was very refreshing, herb-y and sour, great to start off our dinner. The mushroom was blander, but balanced out our high-protein dishes.

The lamb and ribs were just fabulous, and you just have to try them to believe. The meat was cooked to perfection, but the sauces and spices brought them to a whole different level. Our taste buds were in heaven.

Sashimi Chef's selection were just common ones (ours came out with salmon, yellowtail and tuna) but they were fresh. As a frequent to Japanese restaurants for a few years now, this is the 2nd place in the valley that I've had such fresh sashimi. AND this place uses FRESH wasabi!!! 99% of Japanese restaurant in the valley uses powder wasabi. Roka Akor uses wasabi roots, which is less spicy but much more flavorful. Just from seeing this, I knew I was at the right place for sushi.

I didn't get to the Duck breast as my friends finished them all, but the side of fresh mango with Japanese herb was... ""unexpectedly aromatically"" yummy (that's the only way I can describe it). 

We ordered Rice hot-pot to have some carb in our dinner. It was delicious, but frankly a bit salty. It is definitely A LOT for 2 people. The yakitori and wings were alright, since they're just chicken. The sauces again were beautifully done but it's hard to impress me with chicken dishes. Vegetable tempura was just to have some veggie, nothing special.

***Now to the drinks, we got a bottle of Azure sake. Roka Akor is the only place in AZ carries Azure. It's lighter and fresher than common sake, has a delicate scent and light fragrance. It is, indeed, a very special sake, made from a natural spring in the bottom of the Pacific Ocean - yes, from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Not easy to do, but very pure water, the secret to this famous sake. Only a limited amount can be collected during the year.
I wish I had room to order deserts, instead, a desert wine to end the night on a sweet note.

The service overall was equally amazing. I don't think our luck of ""landing"" the private dining room had anything to do with it, but I will go back there soon to find out.

Contrary with other reviewers, the dishes while not huge like those at, say, Buca Di Peppo, they are not as small as people think.  Price-wise, it is pricy. Thus, the bigger your group, the better since you can try different dishes and not max out your credit cards.",2008-09-08 05:07:36

""It will be cheaper if you buy the Combo, because the Strips are $1.79 each.""  LOL, I think.

""$8.79 for six pieces, a large 32 oz drink, french fries, cold slaw and 2 of our special dipping sauces.""  

Ahh, my Kingdom for a simple Chicken option.

Head Office asked for the chicken and when she started digging into it we saw there was clearly an undercooked piece, we could tell even in the low light. Waitress called out the manager/owner who said he would replace it. He did not say he agreed with our opinion on the chicken.

And walking through those thick wooden doors, Church Brew Works still retains the elegant, ornate beauty of a church, with pews as booths and the alter being home to the brewery equipment. A lot of the original stained glass is there too. It's breathtaking.

One drawback to the atmosphere is the constant echo of conversations. It can difficult to hear people talking at your table if it's busy.

Service is good, but it can be damn slow, especially if anyone at your table orders a wood fired pizza. Expect at least a 30-minute wait from the time you order. They're tasty, but a pain if you want to get in and out fast. Pierogi fillings are often novelty and overpriced. (I think at one point they had shark meat stuffed ones?) Not my favorite when there are many, more traditional pierogi options in the city.

Sandwiches are OK and desserts are decent, particularly the bread pudding. I ordered the seasonal pumpkin bread pudding to share and it was awesome. It was very decadent with layers of flavor.

I've never had the beer, but they also brew pop. I once was a huge fan of the birch beer, similar to a root beer, but the quality has gone down over time. It was once more flavorful; it's tasted more watered down during more recent visits. They usually brew one other pop. One time it was cherry soda. Another time it was cream soda.

It's worth a visit for the atmosphere alone. The food is OK, but not particularly memorable.",2015-09-13 14:41:14

Since then, we added another baby to the mix and needed a second carseat. After much research, I decided on a Clek Fllo - and I'm pretty sure they are the only store around that carries them in stock. We lucked out with timing, as they are turning over their 2015 models to make room for the '16s, so we scored a gorgeous top-rated carseat for 25%.

I'm really interested to see how the competition reacts. Aux Délices Café de Bayview, Lettieri Espresso + Bar, & the newly-renovated Loblaws are all going to take a hit - especially if the crowds I saw today keep coming back.  Now that Bayview's Haute renovation is nearly done, the high-flying hoi polloi will be back in droves.

There is a newly-renovated seating area just outside Pusateri's; it looks like a good spot to enjoy my own personal-size lemon meringue pie, which is around $12 here but perhaps it's worth it. I'll have to try it just to make sure. 

Overall, the stock here wasn't as exclusive as I thought it would be. I spotted many products I can buy at Loblaws (although Pusateri's valet parking makes it decidedly more convenient for drivers).  Still, the ready-made foods look appealing. I probably won't buy much here since it's so pricey, but it's fun to ogle the massive dessert case.

Place is beautiful, so cozy. Perfect for a date night or group dinner. Ronald took great care of us throughout the evening. 

They have a sun-dried tomato dipping sauce for the bread. Different and I like it. Started with a bottle of wine and the calamari. We pretty much always get calamari at an Italian restaurant. Theirs is mixed with fried zucchini. Mmm. I love nothing more than taking a healthy green vegetable and deep frying it. 

I declined on a salad because I knew we had a lot of food coming, but I kept sneaking bites of my boyfriend's wedge salad. It was so refreshing. I am not a blue cheese person but the dressing was pretty subtle. 

I opted for one of the specials- crab and lobster ravioli. It had a tomato cream sauce and was topped with cherry tomatoes and kale. Sauce was a little salty but I loved the kale topping. Really helped balance out the tastes and textures. I would probably stick to the menu offerings next time, ended up being a pricey entree (no surprise as its crab and lobster). Boyfriend got the gnocchi and O.M.G.  Don't think we will will be able to skip this when we come back. Delicious.

So, it's $18 per adult to gain admission to the center, which is three floors of child-oriented interactive displays.  Add $12 for the special Pompeii exhibit (really the only reason for our visit). I lost track of how many school groups were running, screaming, banging & blocking every stairwell & exit point.  No effort on the part of school chaperones or center personnel to contain the inappropriate behavior.

The Pompeii exhibit itself has some remarkable pieces & was nicely displayed with interesting information posted alongside.  Nearly impossible to enjoy it though because, in addition to the running/screaming children, at the end of the exhibit a 4D movie is played, very loudly, on an endless loop that can be heard throughout the exhibit space.

I guess every bartender is different with how they handle a busy bar. I did like the large amount of draft beer options.

We finally decided to stay and have a small dinner. Girlfriend got an outside table then walked to the restroom, while I closed out at the bar .. within that brief time, another employee walked by and decided to remove the menus and silverware setting... umm ok?

I had been to the Katsuya in Brentwood before, and while all these Japanese restaurants seem the same to me (Katsuya, Nobu, Sushi Samba, Social House, etc.) and are pricey for having such small portions, I keep coming back to them anyway :p  Each restaurant either has some kind of stand-out dish or ambiance nice enough to make me want to come back.  

For Katsuya, the stand-out dish is their Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna - it is a MUST!  Other than that, we got items that you usually can't go wrong with and they did not go wrong: Creamy Rock Shrimp, Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, Miso-Marinated Black Cod, and mochi for dessert.  Actually, I had never had mochi before so I had nothing to compare theirs to, but it was ok - nothing all that special.  

Service started out pretty good but started to slack off a bit.  For instance, the mochi my sister and I ordered never came out  - I think they had lost the ticket for it or something.  Meanwhile, our friend was done with her meal and dessert long before they finally ended up bringing us our mochi.  Our server though apologized and made up for it by taking it off our bill.  Also a nice touch was the rock shrimp being on the house - I heard the person who brought it out say something about it being a special for locals, and our friend we dined with is a local.  

We got seated at a booth which we requested when I made the reservation.  It was pretty full on the Sunday night we went.  Our reservation was for 8pm, and it stayed busy until closing.  It's a trendy place, and the later crowd seemed to be in their clubbing best :p

Our group of friends came out her on a little experience, after hearing mixed reviews about this place I decided to check this out any way. The price is good for AYCE, compared to sushimon which is almost $30 for dinner.  I gave a quick glance their menu and decided to stick to the appetizers and nigiri for sushi. 

Ohhhhh boy, we ordered:

White Tuna Nigiri: OMG! The most tender and fresh piece of fish ever! It was like having a burst of flavors melt in your mouth. It felt like an exotic rush, idk what it is but I feel like raw fish is exotic. Weird right?

Seared Albercore Nigiri: OMFG!!! Another melt in your mouth sushi, idk what it is but it just tantalizes my tongue, always saying give me more!

Yellowtail Nigiri: Also a definite must! It's sooooo fresh, everything just meshes well together.

Bacon and scallop Skewer: I find their rule a little greedy, seeing you only get one skewer per person. And with the smallest strip of bacon on tiny ass scallop, you've got be kidding me that I'm only limited to one? Well, whatever.....the taste of the skewer is amazing. The juices of the scallop burst out if your mouth along with the bacon. It's so sad that's it's tiny as heck.

Shrimp Skewer: again, tiny as heck but deliciously oozing with so muCh flavor. Whoever came up with their skewer rule was cruel. Leaving a person with something amazing, with a limit.

Oysters: I was never a fan of raw oysters, somi was a bit surprised when I got it. I was under the impression that it was baked, but I should've known. You don't come to a sushi place, expecting to get something cooked.

Salmon Skin roll: It was surprisingly good, I usually get a hand roll, but I was surprised with the consistency of the rice. Not too sticky or wet, just right...with the right amount of stuffing.

Calamari: Fried to a crisp served with the special soy sauce, served on a fancy looking bento box. Nothing amazing, but worth the try.

Spicy Rice cake: More like seet and sour rice cake, interesting but nothing special.

Green tea Ice cream: sweet, but not green tea tasting. I'm sad that they didn't have fried tempura ice-cream. Ohh well, there's always room for improvement.

This is good sushi joint and worth the pit-stop. Get there before 7 if you're coming in for dinner. It gets pretty packed.",2011-02-25 08:29:22

I moved to the area a few weeks ago and have driven by here before, but could not remember if I saw a sign saying that they had a 24 hour drive-thru. So the first time I came here, I asked the cashier at the first window:

Me: Is your drive-thru 24 hours?
Employee: Ummm...... I think so? But I'm not sure. Do you want me to ask? 
Me: That's okay, I'll ask at the next window.

LOL he works there and didn't know what their drive-thru hours were?!?! Come on!! Well, as I drove up to the second window to get my food, I saw the 24 hour sign.

This is generally a sign that proper quality measures are not in place. Hence the low rank and the batch of negative reviews. This is hands down the best taco in the valley. The deal can't be beat. For that price they are large. Three tacos are plenty but if your a piggy like myself go for five.  A true feast. This location is tons better than the original Mesa location. I love the extra hot salsa it's similar to what I make at home. I love the guacamole salsa but it's mild. Tortilla are fresh. Taste like they make them there but I'm not sure if they do. I also really like their pico. Just wish the soda wasn't flat. Friendly staff too. They turn out a lot of orders quickly. The meat could be warmer in the taco.

I like Monta's version of soy sauce based ramen better than their tonkotsu.  

The tonkotsu is definitely rich compared to other ramens I've had. The flavor of the bamboo and mushroom distracts me from the pork flavor.  Thin and firm noodles come with the tonkotsu and that is the way I would have done it. 

The shoyu soy sauce ramen is great and the pairing with a thicker noodle is a good choice because it carries the favors of the broth better.  The flavor balance is right on.  I make this my preferred ramen when I visit. 

Pork rice bowl was ok...a little too much fat and not enough flavor. Also it's sliced too thin to get a good grub-on.

My mom and I have been coming to Pho Saigon 8 since my family first moved to the valley, almost four years ago, and the customer service over the years has just gotten progressively worse. The staff was great when we first started coming here and then as of lately, the staff has just been rude and unpleasant to be served by. Although this restaurant is not close to home, we still drive the distance when we have that craving! We used to come at least once a week, but now every other month or so.

We usually come for lunch on the weekend, so it's always busy during that time. The wait time can be a hit or miss.

I am a creature of habit and order the same exact thing every time. I order the #11 (Pho Tái) which is the broth, noodles, and rare eye round. As far as the pho goes, the broth is always hot and never warm like other Vietnamese restaurants I have been to. It's rich in flavor and there is a good amount of rice noodles in the soup. I love the rare eye round because it's not fatty. A plate of garnishes are provided for the table to share. The traditional Thai basil, jalapeños, lime, and my favorite, crunchy bean sprouts. I love my pho with extra lime, and if more garnishes are needed, you can always ask for more! You might have to ask more than once though because they can be quite forgetful. Also, condiments are a must! A nice squeeze of Sriracha and Hoisin always go into my pho.

If I'm hungrier than usual, I'll order a plate of the crispy fried egg rolls to share. The crispy fried spring rolls are a favorite amongst my family! There are four per order and it comes with four leaves of fresh lettuce as well as the dipping sauce. I'm not too sure what the dipping sauce is made of, but it's delicious! The spring rolls are filled with pork and a variety of veggies.

Overall, the best place for pho in the Henderson area! The food is great and satisfies my craving every time. The service isn't the best, but it'll do.",2017-05-15 02:47:34

1qk5Dgp7u2d3dwUdp6jAOw,ORceu2UCCWxyRzvoElYotw,IZGiXMg13LvEqm8IGE_Gag,4,1,1,0,"First off, don't mistake this for an IHOP, despite the name similarities.  They're VERY different.  IHOP's are like a Denny's....every recipe comes from some corporate kitchen someplace and that's how they roll.  It's sit-down fast-food, no different from Bob Evans, Denny's, etc.

OHOP is a much higher grade of food.  The ingredients are obviously a step above the routine and they're prepared well, most of the time.  I mean, they're cooks back there, not chefs, and you'll get the normal variances, but by and large everything is a big step above the Bob Evans/Denny's/IHOP crowd.

The service is usually excellent, although I've noticed the weekend staff are generally better than the weekday staff.  It's obvious that the wait staff are encouraged to go that extra mile...go a few times and your waitress will start to remember what you order, ask you questions about personal things you might have discussed last time, etc.  It's mostly fake interest, obviously coming down from a management memo, but hey, it beats Marge at the diner who could give a shit who you are, just eat and clear my table for the next customer, Jocko.  And a couple of the waitresses are just downright nice, which is always a plus.

The place runs like a machine...there are managers on the floor at all times, and they've got it down.  Things happen fast and efficiently, although not as quickly as a smaller mom-and-pop place, but then, there's a lot more happening with your food here.

One BIG issue: timing is everything.  The weekend breakfast rush is INSANE and you can expect to wait for a very long time if you don't time things right.  If you don't mind waiting, fine.  Me, I don't wait for food, so I'm very careful.  My wife and I find that 0930 is about the drop-dead time on the weekend.  Arrive before that and you're usually in without a wait.  Usually.  After 0930, you'd be better off planning for lunch.

The atmosphere works fine for me.  I saw another review which stated disappointment that the place isn't more ""homey"".  *Eye roll*  It's a restaurant in a strip mall, get over it, dingus.  The interior was obviously designed by a professional decorator and I think they did a lot with it, personally.  There's no attempt to be all Americana like Bob Evans, and that's fine by me.  Think of it more as ""tasteful modern"".

Another reviewer mentioned the distraction of tons of kids running around, and there can be something to that.  It's a large place and lots of people bring their entire family, but hey, that's more about bad parenting than anything about OHOP.   Yes, it can sometimes be loud, especially if the local women's church group decides to show up.

The prices are high, not gonna lie.  But you get a TON of food.  After several years my wife and I came up with a system...we split one entree and add toast and maybe bacon.  Since everything comes with pancakes, and the pancakes ALONE can be a meal, we usually end up with two more breakfasts out of the deal.  So that's four breakfasts for about $25.  Beat that anywhere.  If you're gonna go in and start chowing down, yeah, expect to spend some money.  

In summary, OHOP is our go-to breakfast place on the West Side.  The food is a grade above anything else we've experienced in town (except Lucky's, but the ridiculous wait and stupidly expensive meals offset the excellent food there, in our opinion).  There are many cheaper options (the Rustic right across the street, for instance) and those are fine, if cheap and filling is what you're looking for.  But if you're more about the taste of your food, OHOP is the way to go on Cleveland's West Side.",2014-02-28 16:06:45

I also felt like the contents of the sandwich made the crispness of the chicken and bread go very soggy incredibly quick. Definitely no chik-fil-a. 

FOR HIM: He ordered the TENDER SUPREME -- 3 boneless tenders with a generous amount of skinny, crispy fries & a cup of coleslaw. The flavor of the batter was very tasty and paired very well with the variety of sauces, particularly the chipotle honey. I found all the sauces to be very interesting too, especially the wasabi honey and the brbbq sauce. If we ever come back, I'll probably opt to order this instead.

Bottom line: Not something I would go out of my way for, but their variety of sauces definitely was a nice signature twist. We are interested in trying the pulled chicken sandwich and the liver & onions next time if ever.",2016-02-02 03:13:58

That's right, why choose between getting fish or getting beef? Get the best of both worlds!  I added two pieces of yellowtail sashimi to my burger and it was a great combo...that is a rare opportunity to get together.

The environment is good too, especially for kids (and the young at heart) with interactive games and video material built into the bar.  Great staff too.

When I arrived with my aunt, I sat on the patio and got drinks not knowing my friend was already at the restaurant. Because the weather was so good I convinced her to join me on the patio.

I opted for the RazzyFresh beverage while the hubby got a beer.  The RazzyFresh was refreshing, but after receiving the food, I realized it wasn't the best option.  It was a mixture of raspberry, mint and rum.  The mint was pretty overwhelming and when trying to drink it with my lunch it felt as though I was brushing my teeth while eating.

As for the food, I ordered the Garlic Parm wings with ranch dressing and an order of fries.  The hubby ordered the margarita pizza.  I had never tried their wings until today and they were fantastic!  Very crispy and flavorful.  I wasn't impressed with the fries.  They were all tiny pieces like we got the bottom of a bag.  The pizza was pretty good.  I'm more of a traditional New York pizza gal, so I'm more impressed with a good crust.  The pizza was a very thin crust, but was cooked well and the toppings were fresh and flavorful.

Pros:
The food is good
They are fairly consistent in terms of taste and quality
The service is top notch
The location is nice in a quiet section of Market Square

The salad dressing was light and delicious. I got the yuzu dressing and he got the house dressing which was a yummy tomato based dressing which kinda reminds me of a marinara type sauce.

The sauce was certainly garlicky, but it lacked that delicious punch that makes you crave more heat.

As for the restaurant itself, it is spacious and littered with (small) TV's.  Lots of seating available, both tables and booths.

The coleslaw is vinegary and there was lots. My boyfriend's fish was crispy and hot and delicious. There are better fish sandwiches in Pittsburgh, but this one can definitely fill a craving. The burger was a little disappointing. It was more like a weird meat patty than a burger, and after trying the fish sandwich, I realized how cool the meat was.

Firstly I hate when Chinese restaurants advertise spring rolls as ""egg rolls"", which is a traditional Hunan dish that was Americanised and Europeanised (yes we have/had them in Europe too) but for some reason the tide turned against deep fried food and spring rolls largely replaced egg rolls. Egg rolls are deep fried, larger and usually have an assorted vegetable (chopped not stringy) and meat filling, usually pork. These are really hard to find. Reading ""egg roll"" on their menu made me salivate, literally-I love egg rolls. 

The next problem is that for me I love Lo Men (Chow Mien) noodles, they did an amazing job and this dish was large, in a traditional Chinese take-away box and absolutely perfect. 

I am trying to wrap my head around how what was once called ""Peking Ravioli"" became ""pot stickers"" but apparently in Nevada they are pot stickers. In Europe and I know on the East Coast in USA too the term Peking Ravioli still prevails, I can accept the change of terminology and they did a great job with these as well--PORK. I do not know why so many Chinese restaurants have gone over to chicken, it is not the traditional way to cook these nor is it good. They made really good ""pot stickers"". (BTW ""dumplings"" is another word that used to describe these, ie ""pork dumplings, fried or steamed""). 

Where they struck out was the Szechuan Beef dish. It was not my dish but I did examine and eat a bit of it as my husband said there was no meat in it all Chinese vegetables as filler-and he was 100% correct. Good luck trying to find the beef in that dish. To top it off it was not the least bit spicy.

There were chips on the table within minutes of sitting down, salsa and coleslaw as well, though I would have liked a bit more salsa in the bowl and it was bland. 

My husband ordered the burrito especial and myself the enchiladas suizas (green). My plate was larger than I've ever seen for one person. The enchilada portion was two large and the plate was filled with rice, beans, and slaw. I loved the rice and beans most! The verde sauce was also lacking in flavor, some heat would have been nice.

Finally I navigated into the Holsom shopping center for a taste.  Apparently everyone likes this place too as there was no immediate parking.  After 10 minutes of parking lot stalking I found a spot and went inside.  The dining room is small and jam packed with tables. It actually reminded me of some of the places I sampled ages ago when I was in New Orleans.  The menu has po' boy sandwiches, gumbo, creole, remoulade, catfish and more NOLA favorites.  The restaurant has been featured on Diner's Drive ins and Dives and the owner comes from New Orleans.  The wait staff was excellent.  Although they seemed like they were running around like a chicken with its head cut off, they all took time to ask how I was doing.  My waitress suggested the Bronzed Catfish and grits and I took the bait.  

Due to the crowd, the wait for my meal was longer than I would have liked for lunch and I received several apologies from the waitress and the manager.  When the meal came, it was truly worth the wait.  The grits had absorbed the flavor of the well cooked catfish and the gouda/mushroom mixture.  The catfish was well seasoned with a light coating that didn't overpower the fish. 

The bread was an afterthought and did not add anything to the meal but did assist in cleaning the last bites of grits off the plate.

I would have liked it to have more of a cajun kick and will definitely try a spicier option the next trip out.

I only have one New Orleans experience and it was in the early 90's so I am not an expert on New Orleans cuisine by any means but I can say I enjoyed Lolas and will return soon.  For lunch you can expect to pay between $9.00 for the least expensive Po'boy to $16.00 for the catfish and grits.",2014-03-22 13:35:47

When I got there, I found several things interesting:

1. First, they bib you.  Yes, you get a bib, but they'll put it on you.  I thought it was novel until I got a pair of boobs mashed into the back of my head and was forced to pretend not to like it due to the sour face my wife was making.

2. The place it wide open.  It's like eating at a crab feast.  Only, with restaurant prices.

3. Everything comes out in a bag.  No dishes.  Just bags with your food in it.

So those were the interesting parts.  Here are the parts I didn't like:

1. They ran out of Dungeness crabs.  Um, you're called the boiling crab.  I expect you to have crabs if your name indicates you're a crab joint.

2. When selling the blue crabs, they sell by weight.  Not by the bushel like I'm used to.

3. It's too loud - between the TV noise and the other diners, I could barely chalk this up as a restaurant experience.

So, I wouldn't be back if I can help it.  Of course, I admit that I am a bit of a crab snob since being the near the Chesapeake, I can get crabs when I want, in the quantity I want, all drenched in Old Bay.  The combination sauce they have there is not bad, but I liked it better on the shrimp and not the crabs themselves.  C'est la vie.",2011-12-09 16:23:01

I was wrong! Hands down these are the best chicken fingers I have had EVER eaten in Las Vegas (Cane's comes in a close second). Juicy, thick and hand breaded and they give you a shiyet load of them! It came with home made potato chips however I am not a potato chip fan period, so my the hubster ate them and I ate his fries (which were awesome). He also had a few of my chicken fingers and after we were done eating he said ""i feel like we've had fingers like that before.""

I asked for a margarita for olives on the side. I got the margarita 15 minutes later no olives. And she wouldn't come often, so I let it go, unhappy, but let it go. The people who I came with asked for the quencher iced tea which looks GREAT in the menu with fresh fruit and all, what we got was a plain cup, no fruit. So why pay more for this than a regular tea? Anyway. Ordered my steak with steamed broccoli and pasta. The steak looked like it had been sitting out for an hour. The broccoli was SUPER DRY and the cheese on the pasta was already hardening.

I absolutey loved this place!!! The only reason why I'm deducting 0.5 is the fact that their menu is so small for such a delicious place! I would come here all the time if they had more things to choose from...perhaps they'll expand? But for now, I'll expand on what I was able to taste.
First off, this place gets busy! ..Well, at least for dinner on a Friday night. I was lucky enough to grab a table minutes before the restaurant flooded with guests and there was a small line up at the door. I did overhear a waiter asking guests if they had a reservation though so perhaps that's an easy option especially if you are expecting to have a larger table.
The decor of this place was so cute. Yes, I'm using the word cute. From the decorations on the wall to the awesome looking light fixures. Although it was a little strange to see a few Halloween decoration up along with their Christmas decorations. Maybe they'll just keep adding to it as each holiday/occassion passes. But I really liked how spacious it was. It was fairly big and they didn't try and cram a million chairs and tables just to maximize on seating. I felt very comfortable.
Onto the food. Our table ordered their spicy ramen which I was told was quite good except for the fact that my guest did not find it spicy whatsoever. Other than that, it was good. The eel rice was very good as well and they did not skimp out on the piece of eel you get. I got the crabmeat and avocado rice bowl and I wish I had one right now as I am writing this review. I have been craving poke bowls and I've got to say, this hit the spot as I am not fortunate enough to be travelling downtown lately so this did the trick. There was enough of each ingredient in this dish which I am very happy about as usually I only get a couple chuncks of avocado and usually there's more rice than anything in these rice bowls. YUM I WANT MORE!
Drinks: hot matcha tea was very good and served in a very large cup. The peach and rose calpis were very delicious too. What's rose calpis? That's what I said, so I ordered it to see for myself. It was only $2 when you order and entree so why not. And I personally would like to say that I slightly tasted like lychee with a hint of rose fragrance at the end. I liked it. Don't be thrown off by it's name!
Dessert: BLACK MILK TEA SOFT SERVE. that is all.

TLDR : Food was good, but not incredible.  Pricing was very reasonable. Bathrooms were clean.  Trash was full.  Beans and rice had unique but good flavor, and the three tacos all tasted good.  No objections. 

Details :  The decor in this place is outstanding.  It looks like they were aiming to be quite a bit nicer than the average taqueria, and they succeed.   The tables are unique reclaimed wood pieces, and the chairs are fun too.  Tables were sticky.  The wall art in the place is incredible, wonderful artist.

The staff were friendly, with one staffer going the extra mile to ask me how things were and if I enjoyed the visit.  

Feedback to management : The one negative about our experience, was the delivery of the food.  As each number was ready, the staffer would stand behind the counter and yell out the number.

The waiter introduced himself, and was an older gentleman. We got our waters and placed our order--dad and I were going to split the BBQ Chicken Pizza and Chicken Caesar Pizza, chicken fingers for the sister, and salmon for mom. 

Our food came out, and the BBQ Chicken pizza was pretty good! Although I'm not a huge onion fan, they weren't horrible. The Chicken Caesar pizza though? Dee-licious! Probably one of the best pizzas I've had. As I was enjoying it, I was rudely interrupted by the hostess dragging a chair across the floor. Nice touch. The lettuce on the pizza was fresh, and the garlic sauce was a winner. The cheese was more of a salad-cheese than a pizza-cheese, which I liked! Everybody else reported their food was good as well.

Service was very good, I thought our waiter was a very genuine gentleman, and had a smile on his face the whole time. Thumbs up. Overall, Harper's exceeded my expectations, and I would return next time I'm near the mall.",2012-07-04 15:28:10

Second, I'd like to mention that when we made our reservation, we were given two seating times: 4:30pm or 8:15pm. Okay then.

Third, the servers don't know how to solve problems. We thought we didn't order something that came to our table, so we asked the server who brought it. He said, ""I don't know"", but made no effort to find someone who did. Along with this, they would make more money if they double-checked what people ordered. My aunt tried to do them a favor and circle the items we ordered. She missed two. The servers didn't check. Thus, there were two items we ordered that we ended up not getting, and deciding we didn't want/need anymore. I suppose this is both good and bad for us (I wanted those two dishes).

Finally, the food. Most of the food we had was just okay. We had a pork aspic, pig ear and bamboo shoot, duck tongue (more salad than tongue), fried meatballs (cute, small, juicy, crispy, but a tad salty), house special Peking duck (not worth the cost, but looks kinda special), taro rolls with some kind of sauce (sauce was missing and no taro taste, but this is a crispy, slightly sweet, yummy thing), chilled spinach with peanuts, homemade noodles in soup (half price menu section, but the more expensive half of half price...however that works), fish head with pancake, yellow croaker?, minced beef and tofu egg drop soup (good for price, but very little minced beef), duck bones with cumin (salty and not enough cumin to be called cumin flavored), sweet and sour pork ribs (not enough meat for the bones we got, and tiny ribs), boiled pork dumplings (nothing I couldn't make at home), etc. There wasn't anything particularly outstanding, or particularly good for the prices we paid. The fish head with pancake had a big fish head with very little meat.

My fiance and I tried the Lady combination on a bratwurst. I didn't know what to expect so when we received our hot dog wrapped in flatbread as opposed to a regular hot dog bun we were pleasantly surprised. Think about it...the larger flatbread holding the hot dog can also hold more toppings and thus, more yummy flavor!

SLD has quite a few options to choose from so it will be fun going back to check out other flavors. And as others have pointed out, the service is great.

I ordered a meat quesadilla with guacamole for a take-out. It was pretty tasty like quesadillas in other non-Taco Bell places. The meat looked like it's been there for awhile and tasted dry.

This particular store, I like to get my produce that I cook up for the week.  Today's steal was a bag of bell peppers (red, yellow, orange) a Costco pack for, yes, you guessed it 99 cents!! They also had asparagus, strawberries, and pomegranate, and no they weren't overripe or bad. In fact just sampled what I bought and it was yum!

I love getting my spices, brown rice, steel cut oats, whole wheat bread, whole wheat tortilla, veggies, and canned fish here. So yes you can eat healthy on a budget.  When you want to splurge...then stack up on your brand name candies here, too! I also purchase my office supplies, holiday decorations and grab bags.  The list goes on and on.

Seriously, I can always find some name brand products here, but it sometimes depends on what shipment they get.  It's doesn't necessarily stay the same. So those that particularly look for products, just because you find it another 99 cent store doesn't mean you'll find it here.  I imagine it like a Ross store, you just kind of have to dig around for some great finds.  

After shopping at this chain, you can't go shopping without saying, ""I can get that at the 99 cent store""

 Lastly, This is in the East side so it is a bit rough around the edges outside, in fact there were homeless in the front soliciting money today.  that was my first time seeing this.  i shop here at least once a week.  Once your inside you should be good, it's actually a well organized shop for all the little knick knacks they carry.  Yes, they sometimes only have about one or two cashiers at a time.  Bargain shopping, umm...it's worth the little wait, probably less than 5 minutes even. It's not a convenient store.

Gotta say, a mixed experience.  I will be back, however, and expect the next experience will be a good one.  These guys are still pretty new, and they're figuring stuff out.  Great foundation, and I expect some serious improvements.  Anyway, on to the review:

I got the steak and eggs with a couple pints of Augusta Ale.  Friends each had the breakfast burger; one had ale so I didn't drink alone, other had coffee.

So, here we go!

The eggs:  Damn fine eggs.  I asked for over medium, I got over medium.  Nicely fried, juuuust salty without overdoing it, and some kind of background spice I couldn't quite pinpoint.  It was good, though!

The fries:  sweet potato fries that could give lessons in awesome to all the posers out there.  These were serious contenders for the title of ""best sweet potato fries I've ever had"".  Was that cinnamon I detected?  Sweet!

The steak:  erm.  Ordered medium rare, arrived closer to medium.  A minor quibble.  The taste was great -- organic beef, very flavourful, heavy herbed/spiced but in a good way.  It was tough, however, and my butter knife had a hard time doing the trick.  Tasted good, as said, but I suspect it was cooked from fridge-cold and the meat had seized right up.  

The beer:  I like beer.  I like Augusta ale.

Friends tucked into their burgers like the apocalypse was nigh and Macho Man wasn't around to save us from the end.  They eat fast.  Not sure how they do it.  Impressive.  They both liked it, though I didn't press for details.  They also remarked on the awesome fries.

Little things:  

*  chipotle ketchup is da bomb!  don't get regular ketchup, get the spicy stuff!
*  first coffee came out looking like tea.  very, very weak.  An errant pot, I'm sure, or someone who just isn't used to brewing coffee at the bar.  Came in a cool bodum, however, so points on style.  They replaced it free of charge with a much stronger brew, and were apologetic for the mistake.
*  friendly staff who, while a tad slow, made up for it with personality and grace.  thumbs up!

All in all, an ""a-ok"" experience with a few missteps preventing it from hitting the **** mark.  Still, there was a lot to like and a great foundation.  This place will only get better, I suspect, and I look forward to being around to experience the growth!",2011-05-30 04:52:17

So my buddies and I head over to get some grub. It's clean and not too expensive. They are the place if you want a big burger. I was hungry so I got the size large with skinny fries and a chocolate shake. The large has to be around 8oz so that's a decent size for a burger when your hungry. My friend got herself the medium. The burger was nice and juicy and they make to order so everything was hot. I like that I can choose whats on the burger. The shake is so good but after the burger and fries it was hard to finish ha ha. Nothing to special about the fries. They weren't bad or have an amazing twist on them so if you like potatoes you will like them.

When it first opened there were long lines up and they even sold out quite quickly but now that the hype is gone you can easily walk in and walk out in 10 minutes.  

The chicken itself is quite flavourful. You have the option of choosing it's spice level.. we made the mistake of choosing extra spicy and all that meant was adding extra hot chilli powder on top. That ruined the flavour of the chicken.. next time would just stick with original black pepper and salt flavouring.  We also tried their popcorn chicken and for 6$ you get an underwhelming amount of popcorn chicken. The bag was half filled but the flavour was so good that you wished they filled the bag actually 6 dollars worth!

They do everything from hot bevvies to smoothies to salads, sandwiches and wraps. I'm a big fan of their custom sammies, more  precisely because of their bread selection (go for challah, so good!) and vast selection of fillings. My usual go to is asian chicken salad, it even comes with a bagel.

We discussed further, trying to pinpoint what exactly we didn't like otherwise. The meat portions were diminutive but decently cooked. The broth seemed to be comprised of salt and not too much else. The noodles, I have to admit, were cooked perfectly. I think what got me riled up was the pricing system and how it impacts the dish. My friend hit the nail on the head when he said it was just ""too much of just one thing"". 

Add-ons are $1.00 - $6 each. Without add-ons, one receives an oversized portion of a very bland bowl, and with add-ons, one may receive an oversized portion of a potentially more interesting bowl which will fill the tummy but empty a wallet. Service was spotty and inattentive. Yawn.

The bartender was nice and our wait was only ten minutes.  The place was packed in the middle of the week for dinner, so I guess this is the new hot spot in Summerlin.

After waiting a while, a server delivered some bread, some basic white rolls, but didn't really explain what it was served with. It took a few tastes to figure out but, I think, that the spread was some sort of bean dip.  Not really my thing.

We tried the New England Fry - calamari, Ipswich clams, and Shishito peppers.  It was ok.  The Caesar salad was amazing.  They also offered a kale option for the Caesar salad.  Not sure what that option was about - if they just added kale or substituted kale for lettuce.  It was really too noisy to get details.

I tried the chicken curry and it was mostly carrots.  A lot of carrots.  The raita that came with the dish was good, but once that ran out I stopped eating.

Service was odd.  Various servers kept pouring ice water into my club soda, which was annoying, especially since the house water does not taste good at all.  And my husband ordered a beer, in a bottle no less, before our entrees came.  But the beer did not arrive until after we finished our entrees.  It was comped but by then we were ready to bail.  It took a while to get a check.  Our server had tables scattered through the restaurant so our server was hard to catch.

They have outdoor seating but even though the weather was nice, the tables were set, and there was a wait, no one was seated out there.  It was the same type of outdoor seating Nora's had - a stunning view of the parking lot and Banana Republic.  Maybe the servers didn't want to bother with it?  So the jury is out on the outdoor seating option.  Frankly, I didn't notice until after we left or I would have asked about it.

My fault for coming to a restaurant within the first few weeks it is open.  I think I'll give it a few months and try again.  The chicken sandwich was not offered for dinner so I'll have to try lunch.",2012-11-10 07:10:59

To start, we have to preface that Comme Ca is expensive. You're talking $75 a person on average if you do not get a bottle of wine. Nothing wrong with the price in of itself except that the food at its core is more on the level of a Yardhouse or another upper mid-level chain restaurant. It's just not very inspired or memorable. I often harp that restaurants that charge an arm and a leg have got to bring the flavor, have to bring some ambience, and most importantly have to do something to stand out so you will remember the experience. For those who get out in Vegas a lot and don't get swayed by just the nice view (and it is a nice view), you will find this restaurant to be shockingly unmemorable. Boring almost. 

It wins on ambience as it pertains to a view but the restaurant itself is dark and almost too quiet (lots of empty tables on a Friday night).  Flavor is meh. Memorability is 0.

We ordered the lardon on flatbread appetizer thing and the bone marrow appetizer. Both were well prepared and tasted great. Nothing to complain about here but certainly not wowed either. Bone marrow was a bit more upscale in feel but the flatbread dish more like something I'd see at Yardhouse or a similar chain. For dinner I ordered their special which was some kind of Ahi Tuna concoction for $39.00. It really was basically a few cold pieces of Ahi Tuna with some tomatoes and green beans. Way overpriced. If you are going to charge $40 for an entree that includes Ahi Tuna, I'd expect a really memorable dish. But it just leaves you wanting ... and really unsatisfied. I ordered their Ginger cocktail drink (the exact name escapes me). I remember getting a small glass with a toothpick in it for $15.00. They could'nt even bother to make the cocktail presentation memorable. 

Overall just a meh experience. Aside from being really overpriced (even by Vegas standards), I don't have any particular egregious complaints other than disappointment and a sense of being underwhelmed and overcharged.",2013-10-12 08:57:53

Someone mentioned that this place is not a shanghainese dimsum place, but a taiwanese restaurant...well the reality is that most places that serve good shanghai dimsum were opened by taiwanese (ding tai fung in taiwan, for example). At any rate, the soup dumplings, and all kinds of other dumplings are all shanghainese cuisine, so are the fried noodles and any form of rice cake.  

I used to LOVE this place growing up. The owner of the place was related to ding tai fong in first markham place but I always thought the food here is a little better than FMP. I don't know if they switched owners by now, but I came back yesterday and the food quality has not changed.

I always order to start their spicy beef tendon (when i was little i used to get my parents to buy just that for takeout when we're in the area).

Firstly, the Kung Pao chicken was served smothered in sauce.  I like the sauce but there was no need to drowned everything

Second, the pineapple chicken was stone cold.  Even on the re-heat the chicken was warm but the pineapple was very cold. 

Thirdly and this often the case here a plate of someone else's food arrived. Now once I might forgive but twice.  And please note, some wait staff are insistent that yes you ordered the item.  Thankfully, the iPad breaks any tie and the item was removed.  The reason why I mention this is that if you waste any food or ask to take it with you.  The customer is charged extra.  

Fourth, the dinner menu adds some extra items. My favourite are Korean short ribs. However, last night's serving was more fat than beef.

The second time (today) the hot dog made me want to throw up. So, I went and got a manager. The guy didn't come out instead told the employee to tell me they don't do refunds. This is the second week they've been open and I've only come twice. It's not like half the season in and I'm asking. So I tell him to go get the manager. When the manager came out he explained I could get the food staff to remake my hot dog. I asked him what makes him think I want another one? I've already lost my appetite and feel sick.

   Oftentimes but not every time, I frequent Downtown Summerlin, it is after an exhausting hike in the open spaces contiguous to Las Vegas. My first stop is to walk inside of Macy's to make a beeline for the Starbuck's by the east entrance. 

   Frequently this Starbuck's has a line of people. It is obvious that the demand exceeds the supply. There are only a few tables that fill up and limited space to move around the diminutive room. You would think that a regional shopping destination would have an inviting cafe with a sundry and variety of seating including outdoor seating. You wouldn't think that the sole coffee house would be one of the tiniest in the City of Las Vegas. The upshot is that I usually buy the cup of coffee to go where I will savour it outside at the water feature or by the arroyo park. 

   When coffee is not just a drink but a lifestyle, you don't mind paying inexorbitant prices for it. This location is not off the charts highly priced like some of the Las Vegas Strip locations but it is more than the average Starbuck's owned locations. This Macy's owned Starbuck's does  charge 27 cents over and above for drip coffee.

Yes, Majerle's is worse.  

Okay, well, no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul, but the place makes me feel like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of Hell.

The set up is terrible.  The TVs are difficult to see from EVERYWHERE in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to TWO SCREENS (!) at one time, they are both showing the same game.  This is a problem during major events like the NCAA tournament or bowl games.  

Moreover, i would be kitten-hearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game i'd rather watch.  

The bar is always crowded, which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible food.

My only complaints are that the host/cashier station is in the center of the restaurant so there they are staring at your every bite(literally), 
the chopsticks are a bit bigger than normal and square shaped so I found them a bit awkward to use, 
and although I sat at the sushi bar I had very little interaction with the sushi chef other than him handing me my plates, the waiter took my order to him, there was no piece of paper to mark my choices and hand in like I'm used to.
Another thing is most of their rolls are topped with macadamia nuts so I ordered them without, no biggie I guess.

All of the staff were very friendly and took the time to describe each of the dishes that were presented to us.

We ordered presumably their most popular and/or visually appealing dishes. The Roy Thai platter included four beautifully presented dumplings of varying colours, each with their own unique flavour profiles. I enjoyed the first two (you are supposed to eat them in a specific order) slightly sweet dumplings the most.

The roasted pork jowl was very, very flavourful but perhaps on the touch heavy side. On the one hand, I actually enjoyed the slight bit of heat the dish had - it was not too overwhelming for me. On the other, I did find the dish to be a bit too salty.

The khao yum was our final dish of the night, which featured colourful, naturally dyed piles of rice mixed with lots of vegetables, sprouts, edible flowers and leaves, etc. and presented in a large gold wok. Although the portion seems large, I would caution that it's not actually as filling as you would expect, given the overwhelming ratio of veg to rice.

I also got a pandan iced tea which was again visually stunning with layers of colours. Cocktails seemed a bit pricy.

The reviews aren't lying, as this is voted as one of the top shows on various tourist Vegas websites.

Unlike other Cirque de Soleil shows, Ka has a driven plot, in which it narrates the coming of age of a young man and woman through their encounters with love, death, and hardships. The show itself is absolutely amazing with the creative use of a moving stage and CGI effects, that will keep the audience at the edge of their seats.

I thoroughly enjoyed Ka's creative uses of certain characters (that turtle, starfish, and crab!) as it will elicit laughter and warm responses from the audience. Not only that, but the music score is amazing and appropriate for each scene, bringing seamless transition between acts and highlighting the climaxes.

This is a great show for families and friends. The audience will fall in love with the cast (don't forget about the long-haired Tarzan adorned in body glitter!), pyro projections, martial arts choreography, and gravity-defying performances.

My sis-in-law is Chinese/Hawaiian and while she liked not loved the fried items..she really enjoyed the fried rice. I think we all thoroughly enjoyed the whole meal...for both the taste and the value of the lunch menu...and this is a definite must go on our next Vegas trip.

Thanks so much for turning us on to this place!!!",2010-07-19 02:23:50

FbIfV-e6aRrK8GVg9ThTtQ,NeOIp8tz0kfxtmA8YUPmJA,nEQFnHydeX2A3bRRDAKqQg,5,5,3,2,"Let me start out by saying......  I'm from Texas.  I've been to the original one in Austin and frequently visited the one in my hometown back in Dallas.  Saying this to say that's how much I'm a firm believer of Chuy's.  I love this place.  I can now check off my go-to place for Tex-Mex in the charlotte area. 

Was able to check out Chuy's last night and I was so greatful.  The restuarant is bursting with color.  It's well lit, it's spacious, and they've expanded the patio area in the back.  The reasons why I love Chuy's:

1.  Prices.  My Baja fish tacos (Had grilled shrimp) were $8.99 for TWO and it came with the good'ole refried beans and rice.  That's dirt cheap in South Park.  Other places are $10.99 for two tacos.  They were so good.  Suggest putting them on corn tortillas instead of flour.  What's up with folks putting fish tacos on flour tortillas??  haha!  The food items on the menu are good.  You can't pick a bad dish.  They're all good.  I didn't try them all last night, but I'm confident that it'll be good.  Staff from Texas came here to train the workers in CLT, decorate, and participate so I know that they're really into consistancy across all of their locations.  

2.  It's just a fun, causual, laid back place to eat.  Sure, there are other places around that are prob just as casual, but there's just something about having that non-fluffy stuffy mexican food.  It's just good ole Tex-Mex.  No it's not authentic.  It's Tex-Mex.  

3.  Margaritas.  They're good.  Enough Said.  Well....wait.  I will say that my favorite was the Texas Martini.  It's a margarita but it comes in a martini glass and a huge plastic shaker that you poor yourself.  smh....so you can either go big and just drink the giant margarita from the shaker (lol) or sip and stroll and pace yourself.  Made with Patron and another taquilla.  Well worth the moolah for that Texas-sized drink.  

They have Kitschy-cool decor and it makes no sense but I love it.  There's a salsa bar that's in the back of an old car...i think?  That was funny.  There are pictures of chihuahuas dressed up in people clothes on the walls.  Makes me giggle.  

Give it a whirl.  It's just another place for those in South Park to try if they want some good no-fuss Tex-Mex food.  The guac I was slightly disapointed in.  It's normally flavored more so I'm hoping that works itself out.  The patio is awesome and can't wait to have a Texas-sized margarita on the patio in Clt.

Honestly, I've taken, at last count, 12 non-veg guests there, and every single person has loved it.

Their prices are on the upper end of causal dining, a three person outing is likely going to come in ~$100, more with drinks.

Almost everything on the menu is great, but the favourites seem to be the faux crispy duck, the panaag curry, the crispy spinach and the sticky rice.

I've never tired their desert offerings, however, as at the overall price of the meal there is usually a better offering elsewhere on St.Denis for desert, at a more friendly price point.

We joined some good friends for a relaxed evening of conversation and good times - I read the menu on their site beforehand, and really liked what I saw; a nice smattering of savory appetizers and entrees, just waiting to be tried.

Being able to order wines in three sizes is a nice touch, and encourages sampling of multiple varieties. I liked that the wine list is one page, rather than a 10lb book. While I enjoy wine greatly, I must admit that I am not well-versed in the specifics of vintages and varieties to be able to decipher lists like that. I like simpler lists, and this one was great - it was easy to match our wines with our apps and entrees. (I picked their malbec of the day, and followed this with a pinot noir...)

The food here is absolutely wonderful - all of our dishes came out promptly (even though the place was packed) and were served at the correct temperature. The service last night was incredible as well - our waiter gave us useful tips regarding the dishes on the menu, and I must say that he definitely was on the ball here. Our table had the shrimp and grits, chicken liver pate (best app of the night!), roasted beets and mussels. All of these were just delicious! For the entrees, we went with the braised rabbit and duck breast. Both were insanely delicious, and well-suited for this setting.

The background music was great, and was not distracting, and it was easy to carry on a great conversation throughout our meal without having to strain, a real bonus, since the place is small and intimate. Many places we have been that are like this one are too loud, and miss the whole point of being in a small, intimate place with great food and drink...

Yes, Toast, you get 5 stars from me for providing a wonderful evening with my wife and good friends - the food and drink was delicious, and your staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.

Other than that, the food is good there. Good enough that my co-workers come to this restaurant all the time.

I ordered the O'zone Special of the day which was the Especial. But if we wanted to know what's in it, per the waitress, look it up under the hot sandwiches...hahaha.  I ain't making this up. That's exactly what she told us. Although it was the o'zone special of the day, it seemed it was their regular sized calzone. I could only eat half of the calzone! And it tasted pretty good.

The Pastalaya was very good even though the spicy Creole sauce was a little too thick. The andouille sausage was spicy, the chicken and shrimp were tender. 

My wife's chicken was tender. The topping was a good with the melted slice of cheese.

To try to sum our experience up it started with such rude customer service on the phone that the front desk offered to comp us a meal, then they sent us to a room that had not been cleaned, there was a light fixture hanging from the shower down into a pool of water, the tables looked like they were chopped up with a hatchet, and to top it off, they were shocked and annoyed that we wanted to switch rooms. Then, the following morning, we ate in the cafe where upon pulling my seat out so that I could sit, the chair was covered in food so the waitress swept it on to the floor. Then, I put my napkin in my lap only to reveal a large chunk of ham on the table. Yuck! The cherry on top was that the front desk's response to our complaints was ""didn't you already get comped?!"" Unbelievable! What an utter waste of money. We will never got there again.",2014-03-01 19:14:47

We were headed to The Barley Mill for lunch - about 20 of us which I understand may be a large number for a lunch however restaurants I feel should be prepared that numbers like this will happen and will probably always happen.

The Barley Mill is a restaurant situated inside a cozy small house. Like I've said previously I love places like this, it has that old cottage feel mixed in with an irish pub interior. This restaurant has a main floor as well as an upstairs floor. 

The server was kind enough to get us our drinks right away and that's about where the good service stops.

I ordered the Chimchurri Sirloin which is an 8oz certified Angus Sirloin that comes with Roasted Potatoes, Asparagus and Chimchurri sauce.

Everyone placed their order with the waitress and we began our wait....and kept waiting.. a manager came up: ""I checked for everyone the food is coming."" Another 30 minutes goes by and by now we've been waiting one full hour for our food to come while everyone else in the restaurant seems to be getting served. We continue waiting... and waiting..and finally our food arrives 1.5 hours later. 

During the time we were eating another manager comes up and apologizes and says there were problems in the kitchen and they kept sending the food back in. Well... they should have just made it right the first time.

My steak I ordered medium rare and it came out about medium but besides that the steak wasn't bad but I've had a lot better in many other restaurants. The Roasted Potatoes were the worst, dry, hard and felt like they were old. The Asparagus was delicious and you know how I love my greens and finally what made my meal a little better was the delicious Chimchurri sauce.

I don't think I'll be back here unless it's just for a beer. My meal came to $20 but I honestly don't think it was worth it having to wait 1.5 hours for my food to come.",2011-12-10 00:47:13

We were sat immediately we mentioned we had never been there before so I was hoping for a little more explanation of the menu but she was nice none the less. I ordered my sandwich without the vegan sour cream and onions but they came out on the sandwich anyway. The sour cream worked out and was delicious but I absolutely hate onions. Other than that the place was a definite return and soon at that. They have a great selection of juices in the cooler for taking with you and I have stopped in frequently for just those since as well.

Up till now, I felt this location made the best Spam Fried Rice of all the other locations until last Thursday.

I ordered 2 Spam Fried Rice last Thursday for myself & wife.
 When I started to eat, I thought they just gave me plain fried rice until I noticed that there were a few pieces of spam in mine. Had to move rice around to even find a piece of spam.

I thought maybe more spam ended up in my wife's order but upon checking her rice found the same with hers.

Could not have been more than 1/2 to one slice, if even that, chopped up in each container. Had to really move rice around to even find a piece of spam.

I wouldn't have been too upset if they told me they ran out of spam but would makeup for it the next time I ordered but they never said anything.

I ordered ""to go"" but still tipped them as I usually do, even if I order to go.

I'm sure the female cashier didn't know but the deceitful cook surely knew what he was doing.

I have Cuban and Puerto Rican family and really prefer these cuisines over Mexican. When I found out that my workplace's dinner to Il Pizzaiolo was changed to Las Velas, I was pretty disappointed. 

My coworkers and I started off dinner with drinks, and I selected the House Margarita. Personally, the drink was a bit strong in alcohol yet way too sweet. For food, we started with appetizers for the whole group; chips with guacamole and salsa dotted the table. This was actually my favorite part of the meal. The chips were perfectly salted and crispy. The guacamole was mild and smooth while the salsa provided a fire roasted kick. 

Though we were a large group, dinner took a very long time, approximately 1 1/2 hours from ordering to serving. We quickly became antsy, especially since our meetings started very early the next morning. We saw folks around us sit down and enjoy their food as we were still waiting for ours. Eventually, our food emerged from the kitchen, including my steak fajitas. The steak was a little chewy and tough while the tortillas were a bit hard.

After taking the food I sat down and immediately overheard the same girls  gossiping about me, laughing and saying my name. Whatever. At least wait until the customer leaves to trash talk.

I remember being a punk high school kid and going to Scottsdale Fashion Square and actually smoking on their ""patio"" that was actually inside the mall.

At that point in my life I had two favorite meals... the Tuscan Lemon Chicken from Hoolihans, and the Diablo Chicken Pasta from Z'Tejas.

Sorry for being all introspective, but nearly ever time I try something from my childhood that I haven't had for a long time I end up disappointed. So here is my dilemma, is the quality gone south, or my taste buds ""north""?

Ug... I dunno, but this dish was a huge let down. I remember the cotija cheese having a nice pop and the pasta being cooked perfectly. This time the cheese was scant and the pasta was a mushy blob.

My wife says I should know better. I used to think my mom's linguini was sent down by angels, now Ia make a Fettuccini Alfredo that Mario Battali would eat off of the floor if i dropped it.

Its me I guess. Sometimes I wish I was a kid again.

If you still love Olive Garden or can't wait to go back to Applebee's you will love this place.

I assumed it was to have a new pizza made. But no, she came right back with it. She grabbed what must have been the special GF cutter, and resumed cutting my pizza. I should have said something to her or asked to speak to the manager. I understand that mistakes are made, but to just cover it up was quite disappointing and sad, not to mention unprofessional.

On one hand, it's often pretentious and overpriced, frequented by d-bags and lacks the vibe of places like Queen West, it's neighbor to the not so distant northeast. On the other hand, I've had some pretty good food experiences there at prices that are only a bit off of what you pay in the elsewhere's of Toronto, so maybe the overpriced thing doesn't always apply? I'm a bit torn. But of the places I've been, I was fairly impressed with the Local.

If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll notice there's one thing I consistently favor....and that's consistency! Naturally, quality goes long with that. The first time I went to The Local, I was totally impressed. Good burger, fries and a pretty decent salad. Service was quick and our waitress was friendly and helpful. Price was what I expected and everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. I'd give that one four stars. But the next visit was just ok. Nothing special, just ok. Burger didn't seem to be handmade (maybe I just remembered incorrectly?) and like Liberty Village itself, the whole thing felt very formulaic and designed. It was nothing special, just ho-hum. I was left wondering which one of my experiences was the real one: the awesome first or the so-so second.

Service was good but not great the second visit. Place was quiet due to it being lunch so it was difficult to judge the atmosphere, but overall even with the lack of consistency I'd still say it's worth trying out.

SjQ9Kd1KMPrBrKNfiZHlqg,tWVlSt-66fl6bk9_5UzltQ,IPrtHNKwLERUKvYJGDOHtg,5,1,2,1,"Lemon Grass is my favorite place to have dinner when I'm going to the Cedar Lee, or just over on the East Side in general. 

Yes, its menu is pretty much like every other Thai place at first glance. However, one thing that sets it apart is the large quantity of vegetarian entrees, or entrees that can be made vegetarian. My husband actually had a hard time choosing an entree at dinner last night, because there were just so many to choose from, not to mention that more appetizers were vegetarian than not. Four out of 5 times when we go out to eat, his decision is made for him because there is usually only one vegetarian option on a restaurant's menu (and it's usually a veggie burger or cheese pizza). 

Me being the hypocritical flexitarian that I am, I always indulge in my favorite dish at Lemon Grass when I visit: the Spicy Thai Basil stir-fried duck. It is just phenomenal. My brother and I shared this dish about three years ago (or whenever it was that 500 Days of Summer was playing at the Cedar Lee) and he still talks about the dish to this day.  

This duck dish is just delicious, but probably not the healthiest thing on the menu. It reminds me of certain Korean chicken dishes my mom makes, where the fat from the meat melts into the spices and juices of the rest of the dish, and you kind of spoon all of that on top of your rice as a clear fat gravy. It's the best ever.  Also, I appreciate that the duck is deboned as well as it can be (only the bones in the drumsticks remained).

I also really enjoy the fluffy, perfectly-cooked jasmine rice at Lemon Grass. 

For dinner last night, we also ordered the basil fried rice with tofu. I think I prefer the same dish at Cuisine du Cambodge simply because I like it to be a little on the spicier side, but my husband scarfed it down, loving it.

Overall, the servers, greeter and bar staff were SUPER friendly here last night. I think we were greeted with an enthusiastic welcoming hello and sent off with a very kind Thank You by every single employee that we passed.",2013-03-20 15:17:06

It has the same name, same look and feel and when TVC first opened, it was a Stations Casino just like Green Valley Ranch is.  

We had dinner here on Easter Sunday so pretty much, they raised the price to $25.99 for adults and the only difference is that there were a tray of Peeps in the dessert station.  Apparently if you're a Stations Casinos player card holder, you'll get a discount.  Every little bit helps.

But focusing on food quality and selection, let's face it, no one can top the buffets of the big box luxury casinos, i.e. Bellagio and Wynn.  But at the same time, you're paying almost double, if not more.  With that said, the offering at The Feast were decent, probably a little too basic meaning, they served the typical Fried Chicken, Mashed Potatoes, Pasta, Pizza, etc.  They had your usual Asian, Italian, Mexican, American and Seafood stations.  The Salad Bar was nice as they had a few mixed salads, antipasto and chilled shrimp.  I'm really surprised that they didn't have any crab, especially with the premium in pricing.

Overall, The Feast was a nice buffet but certainly not the best out there in Vegas.  As far as in Henderson well, Studio B has The Feast beat.",2011-04-29 04:10:46

1. Mayo - It's pretty random I know but any dish with their mayo is great, whether it's chicken karaage or gyu don.

2. Karaage - Speaking of which, karaage is really well done.  Nice chunky pieces of juicy chicken fried to a perfect crisp.  This is usually my goto dish here.

3. Drinks - I've been here many times but only tried a drink tonight.  Drink menu had some standard bubble tea fare but also some interesting Japanese drinks like calpis.  I went adventurous and got the Rose Calpis with lychee jelly.  Drink was large and pink with a generous sprinkling of ground up rose petals.  The taste surprised me a little as it was intensely floral.  I thought it was just ok but for those who like that rose flavour, this one is a winner.  It went well with the lychee jelly.  My wife had a strawberry matcha milk tea.  It wasn't that great, no hint of matcha at all and only a faint strawberry flavour.  It tasted more like a shake to me.

Bad:
1. Udon - Wife said udon looked like someone's leftover dinner.  Udon was overcooked and soggy, the enoki mushrooms were no saving grace as they were sparse and chopped up.  I don't remember a complaint in previous visits because she usually gets this so maybe it's a one off or maybe it got worse.

2. Cash/debit only - If you read my reviews, you know how I feel about this policy.  I think prices are high enough to warrant allowing payment by credit card.

3. Water - I point this out because I distinctly remember this every time I come here.  It usually tastes like washroom.  I don't remember if it's specific to the warm water or not but the water is usually a turn off.  I got cold water tonight and it was better, but I think still a faint taste.  Could be the way the cups are washed? I have no idea.

Worth it?
Sure.  Despite some of it's flaws, Moji is ultimately more hit than miss.  The food is simple, elegantly presented, and generally well done to warrant repeat visits when that non-sushi Japanese craving hits.",2018-05-12 03:28:09

The first experience I had was absolutely horrible. We waited for about half an hour and were seated on the patio. Although the weather was okay, it got hot really quick since there was absolutely no shade. There were dogs on the patio which is fine, but what did not sit well with me was that the waiters were picking them up and then delivering food to tables. The dog that was at the table right next to ours was small & not trained as he kept peeing on the ground. Like I said, one of the waitresses kept picking him up & playing with him while serving tables. Complete turnoff!

On top of that, the food we got wasn't impressive. My date got the breakfast burrito & I got the omelette with spinach, mushrooms, & cheese. I ordered white bread and not once, but twice, our waitress brought me sourdough! We aren't pleased with any of it.

The second time I went, it was with a large group & we opted to get a table inside. The wait time was horribly long but we knew that would most likely be the case. The service was spot on. Our waitress was great in getting us everything we needed, kept our cups refilled, etc. The food was much better. I got the Benny Duo with the Bella! Bella! Benny and the Benny Goodman which came with hash browns. The Benny's were just okay - the Bella was better than the other one, but the prosciutto has a weird taste as did the salmon lox. Keep in mine their hash browns aren't of the crispy variety.

I will have to give it up for the pancakes that we received to share! The Pineapple Upside Down Pancake was one of the best things I did ever have! There were chunks of pineapple cooked inside the pancake which was topped with a vanilla sauce & cinnamon butter. I would highly recommend this!!! If you're a fan of peanut butter, try the peanut butter cup pancake! The flight is really sweet so if you're looking for something a little bit less sweet, try the French toast!

I think I'll be returning to Snooze for the pancakes and perhaps the French toast .. But probably not this location.",2015-11-23 02:58:49

I ordered the chicken paillard (served along with goat cheese, pine nuts, orange segments, and arugula, dressed with a oil), it tasted fresh, healthy, and but was average overall.  It lacked any depth of flavor.  We were served complementary bread with our meal which was paired with cold unflavored butter.  That was also quite surprising to me as restaurant of this caliber will typically serve a warmed whipped butter that has been flavored.

The decor is amazing as they tore down 2 older units in the plaza and made it one huge restaurant. The wooden decor gives it an authentic Asian ambience that we don't usually see in Mississauga.

We ordered the pan fried pancake stuffed with beef (pancake was dry and hard with thin hard slices of beef with little sauce), Shanghai style stir fried noodles (super oily and underwhelming), noodles in stewed spiced beef soup (this was actually quite tasty, the noodles were made fresh and had a nice chewy texture, the chunks of beef were flavourful and well seasoned, slightly on the spicy side), and an order of steamed dumplings stuffed with pork and Chinese cabbage (the dumpling wrap wasn't too thick and it was juicy and tasty). On a separate occasion, we tried their dim sum - the only good item was the deep fried shrimp dumpling - everything else was horrible (the skin on the har how was tough, the tripe was inedible and was way too chewy, the buns were hard as rock). We ordered a chicken fried noodle and they brought out a chicken fried rice. We told them to return it and make us what we ordered. Then the waitress comes back and says, oh if you take it, we'll give you a discounted price. Ugh!

They also have 2 columns of pricing in the menu - if you pay an annual fee, then you pay the Member price. How annoying! I might go back to this place to buy a bubble tea, but that's about it.

It is the type of place that ruins your old standby spot to Shabu Shabu, no more Yoji has taken it to the next level.

I truly enjoy taking my son to Adventuredome to enjoy a day of rides. 

Our last visit was on his birthday in July. I even had a coupon that was in the 2011 Entertainment guide which issued us two for one wristbands! That is a deal! 

We did our own b-day celebration as they do assist with birthday parties for 12 or more only. We had a small intimate celebration with just a few family members. 

All day at your leisure as you can come and go as long as you have your wristband on. 

Did not purchase food inside as the options were limited along with hefty prices that just seemed criminal to pay. 

We had lunch at the Pizzeria located inside of the Circus Circus hotel and casino. The pizza was fantastic and gave us a chance to sit in a comfy booth and relax a bit from all of the excitement of the rides. 

The rides are plentiful for all ages. My son turned 4 and he had so many options in rides to enjoy both solo and accompanied. 

They have Sponge bob 4D and Dora the explorer 4D animation shows which were fun also. As well as Happy Feet simulation ride and show! 

We took lots of pictures, many great photo ops all around the dome. 

Yes it is hot and musty inside of the dome, the ventilation is not very good. I suggest you dress cool and bring plenty of cold water bottles. They don't care what you bring, or shall I say really are not watching.

Sadly, I did not partake in the buffet... I ordered off the regular menu which didn't seem overly priced or too big.  Had a Chicken Taco Salad and it was just the right size for my lunch that day.  Have to say, I was a little jealous of the buffet eaters since they seemed to be enjoying each and ever trip back to the buffet.

I believe this site used to be where Max & Erma's was... but they did a complete gut job.

If you like red velvet cake, I would definitely recommend stopping by to try theirs out. The cake is wonderfully balanced between red velvet and cheesecake while not being too sweet. The red velvet cake is light and moist while the cheesecake is dense without being overbearing - it's a much better substitute for overly sweet cream cheese frosting that usually accompanies red velvet cake.

The service was also lovely here even though I was only getting a cake to go. The winter cold fogged up my glasses and the barista offered a napkin for me to wipe my glasses as well as a menu to browse. Upon putting the menu back, I was helped and checked up on by three other staff members. I'd definitely come back to try a couple of their other cheesecake flavours and a cup of coffee when patio season comes back.",2018-01-23 20:22:54

We had heard about the restaurant through a Netflix show with David Chang.  Everything we had was delicious.  Lots a pizza types, different crusts, different toppings but all tasty.

We started with two salads.
HOUSE SALAD - Mixed Greens, Cherry Tomatoes, Red Onions, Mozzarella, Croutons and Balsamic Vinaigrette.  This was so good.  Loved the dressing and all of the ingredients.  

CLASSIC CAESAR - Hearts of Romaine, Croutons, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Caesar Dressing.  I did not have any of this but the group loved it.

For pizzas, we got a variety so we could try different things.

MARGHERITA - San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Fior di Latte Mozzarella, Fresh Basil, Sea Salt and EVOO.  This was so tasty.  The crust was crisp and soft at the same time.  Good tomato flavor.  

NEW YORKER - Sliced Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, House Made Fennel Sausage, Pepperoni, Garlic, EVOO, Oregano, Pecorino-Romano and Ricotta.  Yum.  The sausage was spicy but tasty.  Loved all the cheese on it.

Chicago Cracker Thin Pepperoni - loved the thin crust.  Good pepperoni flavor.  Nice to having something thin with all of the thick choices.

Giant Sicilian Style House Made Focaccia with Pepperoni - this was delicous.  Even though it was thick, it was not heavy.  Definitely good for a big group.

THE VEDURA (VEGGIE) - Vine-Ripened Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Sautéed Spinach, Mushroom, Caramelized Onions, Garlic, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Shallots, Green Onions and Feta Cheese.  Our vegetarian really liked this.  Lots of good veggies on top, good flavor.

 Like a mini city with plenty of places to shop, eat, and be entertained. 
Parking is ample- whether you prefer garage, street, or valet.
The Saturday farmer's market and other family/kid friendly events make it a great place for everyone. I even saw dogs in the mix of people so that is a plus for a pet owner like myself.
Outdoor shopping in Vegas can be a bit tricky in both winter and summer, but hey we locals are good at adapting to the extreme weather.
Finding all the stores can be a bit of a challenge at first, but there are numerous interactive maps to help you along the way. The place is set up like a city with blocks so I don't think you can really get lost.

When i approached the bar to ask about what kind of drinks were available during the happy hour i was informed that anything they didnt have to open (ie wines) were half off. Then i was told the server would be taking my order. After we ate and paid the bill a few of us migrated over to the bar for some drinks and the first thing i was asked by the bartender was ""where's your server?"" 

Food wise everything was pretty good. Some things are better on certain crusts like the white pizza on the thin pan totally awesome and considerably less troublesome than going to cosmo for secret pizza. 

The Di Fara Special on square cut thick crust is absolutely incredible with the crisp pepperoni but i honestly would have loved it a lot more if they julienned the basil and just threw it all over the damn pie with no regard of quantity control what so ever.

That's about all i can remember at the moment. Being super super hungry and devouring an alarming amount of square cut slices and washing it down with many Angry Orchard ales on tap to suddenly get you full takes a lot out of you. 

I definitely know where to go if i ever have a late night pizza craze on the cheap side now.

Of course I do!

This small restaurant in a Tempe strip mall has earned a special place in my heart.  No, not just because of the artery-strengthening cheese.  It is home to the best cheesesteak I have experienced since moving to AZ.

While the menu offers a variety of choices other than cheesesteak sandwiches (chicken and even *gasp!* salads), I stick with what I know and love:

Regular with Cheez Wiz ($7.35) - bring your appetite, because this sandwich is big!  A generous portion of thinly sliced meat and that oh so important Cheez Wiz is nestled within a soft bun.  It is gooey, drippy and messy.  Perfect.  If Wiz is not for you, it is also offered with white American cheese, Provolone or Mozzarella.  While I prefer mine with just the basic meat and cheese, you healthy types can also get any combination of 'OMG' - onions, mushrooms and green peppers.

Fries are a very nice compliment to the sandwich.  Let's be honest here, fries are a very nice compliment to nearly anything.  Forefathers' fries ($2.55) are hot, salty and crisp.  If you haven't gotten your fill of Wiz on your sandwich, you can turn those fries into Cheese Fries ($2.95).  Either way, be sure to grab a container of 'fry sauce' (I am guessing this is some blend of ketchup and mayo).  One taste and you will want to put this on everything.

Often when we can't figure out where to eat and we've exhausted our yelp lists, we go to groupon for suggestions. Unfortunately, I was less than impressed with our experience. The hostess was fine as she sat us at our table. When our server greeted us he was very nice. We informed him of our groupon and ordered our drinks. The drink cart girl was very nice but a little over the top. We started with the salad bar and there are a lot of good options. When we got back to our table, we noticed that some people had markers to let the meat servers know to come to their table but we didn't. That was a little confusing at first, but then a meat server did finally come to our table. The first few times the meat selection was either bacon wrapped or well done. I informed a few of the servers that I could not eat pork and preferred medium rare. I'm not exactly sure why a high end steak place is serving well done steak as the main cook temp. Some pink or red on some of the steaks would have been nice. We did get the surf and turf, but were disappointed that it didn't come with the lobster. I was also kinda grossed out by the shrimp. The coloring was off and it looked very limp/weak. No thanks. However the other surf options were better, the salmon was good and the white fish was very flavorful. 

Anyway, after a few rounds of well done meat, we did get one medium sirloin and it was really good. Although I was mostly full at this point. I'm not saying the meat tasted bad, because it didn't. It was on the whole quite flavorful, but there should be a varied options for cook temps. Medium rare people don't like well done people don't like medium rare. Offer both. It makes no sense to only have well done. The service was pretty good, although the table next to us had a lot of issues. She was also irritated that all the meat was well done or pork.

jmkj-8zih67jgqZxFTMi0Q,XJYFjbH-oTmu2dATTqyauQ,4dCOilGYflzGzizOPKyvow,5,1,0,1,"I am in love with Grassroots Kitchen and their food. I originally found out about them from Yelp and I was not disappointed. My first visit was for happy hour with my husband. They have great happy hour food and drinks from 3-6pm. During happy hour, signature cocktails are $6 and some appetizers are discounted. 

For drinks, we both ordered their signature margarita. Let's just say it was a lot of margarita. For appetizers, we ordered Dad's Grocery Bag which came with a loaf of French bread, three cheeses, three cured meats, nuts and local honey for $10. We also ordered the ""boat load of wings"" which is 1.5 pounds of chicken wings/drumsticks for $5 - a great deal! For our entrée, we split Topher's Braised Short Ribs which comes with asparagus and jalapeno grits. The Grocery bag was delicious - especially the meats and cheeses. The bread was a little on the hard side and I was expecting olives, but not a big deal. The wings were delicious with a sweet BBQ sauce. Definitely a lot of food, but we managed to polish them off. The short ribs were really good - both juicy and tender. The jalapeno grits were good, nice and spicy from the jalapeno, but grits aren't my favorite. We wished we had room for dessert because the key lime pie sounded yummy.  

We loved Grassroots so much that we came back for lunch. We came around 1pm on a Friday and it wasn't very busy. They were able to sit us right away and our waitress was quick to take our orders. For a starter, we ordered the pork belly which comes with spicy tomato jam, candied pancetta, and toast points. My husband LOVES pork belly and orders it no matter where we are. This pork belly was delicious, but a little on the dry side. I loved the pancetta, but they aren't really ""candied"" so much as drenched in maple syrup. It's cool since it was still delicious. For my entrée, I ordered the smoked brisket sandwich with dirty orzo. Oh my goodness. I am in love with this sandwich. The brisket melted in my mouth. I am craving it just writing this review! The dirty orzo was also delicious which a myriad of flavors. (Also makes a great snack the next day.) My husband ordered the shrimp po'boy with shoestring potatoes. The po'boy was on a French baguette and while delicious, I found it difficult to take a bite when I sampled it. My husband loved it and enjoyed the shrimp greatly. I can't wait to come back for lunch and get the brisket sandwich again.

Our third visit was for dinner on a Wednesday evening. Soup of the day for Wednesday is Grassroots Gumbo so we ordered a bowl to split. We also ordered the pork belly appetizer and decided to split the short ribs, which was a good idea because everything was so delicious and filling. The Gumbo was amazing with super tender chicken and spicy sausage. I want to come back every night for this Gumbo, that's how good it was! 

Overall, I would highly recommend Grassroots. Definitely come check it out. Whether it's lunch or dinner, you won't be disappointed!",2014-02-10 17:49:15

both cakes, very moist.  the red velvet cake, a little on the bitter side.  the raspberry - basic white cake with pieces of raspberry  - nice taste.  the frostings ( cream cheese and white chocolate ) both were good.  might be a little on the sweet side for some, but i liked it.

We were in luck - no line (unheard of for Saturday brunch in Calgary) but we were seated promptly and able to order right away.

They have an outdoor patio with a few chairs for people to sit and people watch but it was still on the cool side, so no one was eating outside just yet. The interior is super slick - open air, modern and gives off a cool, hipster hippie vibe without trying too hard to impress. Me likey.

My sis has been here multiple times so I let her do the ordering. Let the experts do their thaaaang.

- 2x Bubbles & fresh squeeze ($10.50) - 5 oz carafe of fresh squeeze organic orange juice,  1/2 oz elderflower liquere, peach bitters, and 5 oz prosecco. Essentially, a mimosa to brighten up your morning! Fresh, bubbly, and refreshing. Although on the expensive side, to say the least.
- Falafel quesadilla ($15.50) with brown rice tortilla ($1.50) - falafel, hummus, tahini, sundried tomatoes, sheep feta, cabbage, carrots, pickles, black olives, and banana peppers grilled in a sprouted tortilla and served with tzatziki. My sis and I both shared our dishes. The tortilla had a satisfying crunch to it. Add a bit of both sauces to the quesadilla and you're good to go.  
- El sombrero ($15.00) with brown rice tortilla ($1.50) - 2 smoked tofu with seasonal greens, spiced black beans, sundried tomato, red onion, mushroom and avocado grilled on a sprouted tortilla, with sprouts, tomato jam and garlic aioli served with rosemary hashbrowns and choice of soup or salad. We went with the daily soup (they put it on the quesadilla plate), a roasted red pepper, which was light, creamy and healthy. I never use beans when I make my sandwiches, genius! The hashbrowns could have been crispier. It was lacking some flavour.
- Chocolate torte ($9.00) - made with a chickpea brownie crust and mousse top served with seasonal preserves. This was really, really good. I'm not the biggest chocolate dessert fan but the mousse with the sauce (tasted like a currant compote) was match made in heaven. We were going to pack half of it for later but ended up eating it all, oops.

The Coup is a cool spot to catch up with friends and/or to bring a date along. The service is friendly, the food is vegetarian (think local, organic, gluten and vegan friendly) and the cozy, relaxed atmosphere makes me actually want to recommend a vegan restaurant for once.

The wings were top notch. I got them plain, but asked for three sauces on the side: redbeard's signature sauce, jalapeño and cheese sauce, and a Horsey sauce that was the surprisingly best sauce.

Our server Cindy was perfect. She recommended the Horsey sauce and although I was skeptical about it at first, I was glad to have tried it.

The grilled calamari was excellent, the grapefruit being an original addition and going well with the tangy green salsa, but there were only three (3) pieces of squid on the plate. The local beef sirloin was also great (I had it medium, and it was around 10oz), but nothing out of the ordinary which makes one wonder why it's almost $40 on their regular menu.  

The chocolate torte at the end was a disappointment. It was dry and stale and the raspberry caviar was replaced with jelly which had the consistency of the one you are buying for thanksgiving. Not cool for a $45 (top tier) summerlicious dinner selection.  

Overall, not bad for SUMMERLICIOUS deal, but I'd never pay their full prices for this level of quality and creativity.  I guess the Bay St. vicinity has an automagical influence on inflating prices without corresponding to actual quality and creativity.",2015-07-21 13:04:13

Came here with a group of friends who really hyped this place up for me like it was the best Mexican food on earth. I was also forced to come on a semi-full stomach so that's also probably why it affected the ""okayness"" of this place. It's good for groups and was not too busy when we came in. They have an extensive menu and also extensively pricey on some items. Specifically the ONE taco I ordered was freaking $8. I thought it came with 2 but realized that it was only 1 when the waitress asked me. I ordered the Fish Taco which had a star next to it so I was expecting it to be wonderful as fuck for the $8 I was going to pay for it. But no... it was literally just like wtf. It was a small taco with a soggy grilled fished topped with a shit ton of mangoes, onions and cilantro and some sort of tartar sauce I'm assuming. But the tortilla was actually pretty good..much better than the soggy fish. I was also disappointed in the chips and salsa that my friends worshiped because I've definitely had way better chips and salsa than that. Is it my fault that I was given false high expectations? Lol. Oh yeah and I also got a chance to try their Supreme Nachos which was basically Taco Bell's Nacho Supreme on steroids. Again, nothing special at all.

Hit or Miss.

I've had great times here ... other times completely bored and forced.

First of all, my major complaint is the NO CARD policy.  Fine, i can respect that, though like everyone else under 35, rarely carry cash ... but dammit, can you make sure that your crappy ATM works?  

So, the PBR is cheap and drinking a pitcher of it is fun.  I wouldn't touch a mixed drink here.  

Their juke box is pretty ace, but alas, good luck getting a play on it.  Not likely if you're just passing through. 

So what is the distinguishing factor for the hit/miss aspect?  Come to think of it, the great times that i've had here have all come towards the end of the night.

The waitresses stuffed into the authentic Eastern European dresses, the old timers shuffling to the oom-pah-pah tunes orchestrated by the tired and weathered accordion playing Polish DJ. The scenery is familiar too. The wood paneling, the scenic murals of a far away world printed on the walls, the families joined around the tables for a night of indulgence. The aroma's lofting through the dining room consisted primarily of meat and fermented cabbage; and in the distance, freshly percolated coffee. The smells. They are all familiar. I felt at home.

While I can't claim heritage to the Eastern European influence that Frank Sterle's Slovenian Country House represents, I'm familiar. There's always been a large population in NE Ohio. I'm familiar with the cuisine. I've been to many parties and gatherings in my time that felt exactly like the scene created that night at Sterle's. It was comforting.

Told that Mimo Ferraro's recent focus on Pizza Forte had given way to a new Chef with skills set to further improve the cuisine at local legend Ferraro's Italian Kitchen, it was with expectations of rustic Italian done 'right' that four friends sat down to dinner at the storied space on Paradise, and with top notch service that saw visits from both Chef Francesco di Caudo and Gino Ferraro the four-course family style tasting was everything that was anticipated, a few 'gifts from the kitchen' showing signs of things to come while classics came through loud and clear.

In many ways a 'locals' spot, in part due to the heritage but also as result of location and Sin City's celebrity chef culture, entrance to Ferraro's is met by jovial greetings at the podium and with a bar plus outdoor patio on the left as the low-lit dining room sits to the right the feeling is at once familiar but also intimate - the white linens, candles, and rose on each table all building on an atmosphere less-and-less frequently seen in modern dining realm. 

Navigating a menu steeped in heritage, many 'signatures' outlined while seasonal notes decorate a large collection of house-made pastas, it was with a basket of warm bread with oil atop caponata that the two-and-a-half hour meal began and with a bottle of white from the well-priced list soon poured for some a duo of sliced truffle alongside meatballs and polenta proved a decadent opening duo, both notably available as part of the 4-7pm happy hour in the lounge at a fraction of the a la carte price.

Transitioning to Antipasti, the well sourced Affettati e Formaggio was presented as a veritable bargain at $18 with mortadella, prosciutto, and speck all shining alongside crumbly Pecorino and rich Gorgonzola, but acknowledging that none of these items are made on-site the true star was actually bowl of Mrs. Ferraro's sliced eggplant, an in-the-know sort of item served at the request of one diner that saw the oft-fried ingredient breathed new life through vinegar, sugar, and black pepper - each bite delicious on its own, but all the moreso when used taken as a poignant foil to the charcuterie's meaty sapor.

Joking that an Italian Tasting Menu mostly means the chef will send out more pasta, round three featured a quartet of primi plated tasting-style by the kitchen plus a bowl of pasta created at the Sicilian Chef's whim, and although the risotto unfortunately came off a bit undercooked the four house-made noodles were undoubtedly amongst the best in the city, the signature Puttanesca not nearly as briny as one may guess from the ingredients while both gnocchi and agnolotti were tender bites of decadence, the artichoke pasta marrying discrepant flavors with brown butter a truly dynamic dish that hopefully represents a sign of evolution from a kitchen already well versed in the things it has long done well.

Sticking entirely to signatures for secondi it would seem obvious that no meal at Ferraro's should end without the city's most storied Osso Buco, and carved tableside by Gino with no more than a fork and spoon the tender meat in rich wine was just as good as rumor would have it, a compliment no less applicable to juicy braised rabbit served alongside lemony wilted spinach or the best tripe dish I've encountered stateside in quite some time, each supple bite rife rife with texture while the spicy sauce served to highlight the offal's intrinsic flavor rather than hide it like so many others.

Perhaps mistakenly allowing the kitchen to decide upon dessert it was with a rather mundane chocolate cake that the evening was originally set to end, but having heard rumor of a tiramisu not to be missed a slice was requested along with four spoons, the sizable $12 wedge every bit as textbook as the menu's other classics with a delicate balance of mascarpone and cinnamon overlying feather-light ladyfingers ever so faintly accented with coffee and a the slightest hint of liquor.",2015-08-10 23:02:29

Located in a plaza off of Yonge Street. Fee parking, very bus accessible because its close to a viva stop!
.

Decor:

It is bright with lots of window. A very small crowded dine in place. The order part is a small area when you watch in. I'm a big line up orderly person and ordering here sometimes gives me a wee bit anxiety. Line ups are sometimes not followed.

Getting food:

When you order and stay in, you go and sit and they bring you your food. OK. Once again anxiety, food doesn't necessarily come to people in the order that you ordered.

The Food:

It is great. The chicken in the peri peri sauce is delicious. It's rotisserie. Succulent and flavourful. You can get it in different spices. I like mild, I'm a bit of a heat wimp. You get a number of choices for sides, I always pick the corn. It's spicy and juicy. Yum.

You can get plain bread or garlic bread. You can't go wrong with either choice. The bread is soft and heart. I really like it. Salads are hearty and filling too.

The thing I love getting here is the chicken livers. You get a bowl of them they are spicy and are perfect paired with the bread.

They do a really big take out business. I'd say 90% of the orders while we were there were take out.

Conclusion:

It's great food for a fast food place. Reasonably priced too.  I think it literally has something for everyone.",2015-10-17 22:37:19

That is more than I can say for the boy who, after being served, asked why there was a pancake on his food.  I love the modernly styled atmosphere, and the novelty of the ""crepe cam"" (it is exactly as it sounds, camera feeding to a TV so you can watch your crepes being made).  And, as everyone said, the staff were incredibly friendly, that will keep me coming back.

Crepe Expectations does a great job with having a diverse menu of savory and sweet ""dishes"".  Additionally, they have fantastic prices on beer for a boutique cafe!  Most of the standard beers were only $3, and they have a pretty extensive wine and specialty drinks menu for a creperie.  They also offer the treat of all-you-can-drink serve-yourself water infused with lemon or cucumber.  Yum.  If you want ""plain water"" I think you might have to request that specially.  Bother the flavors were subtle enough I think even finicky folks can handle it.

Warning: one crepe per person is sufficient.  I expected street food style where we may want a couple each.  Bad move.   We discovered that three crepes for two people was far too much food.  

I tried the Sunday Morning - which was just what I was hoping for on a Sunday morning, egg, seasoned potatoes, and cheese wrapped in a crepe.  It was a yummy savory breakfast, but honestly, with such a hearty filling, the crepe itself kind of fades into the background.  That said, I much prefer it to a standard omelet, primarily for the side bites of mostly crepe.  I do love eggy crepes...  I also tried The Avalon - pears, goat cheese, walnuts, and honey.  The flavors of pear, goat cheese, and walnut were rich and delicious.  However, the honey was a bit overwhelmingly sweet.  I guess eating three bites instead of 30 at a time is better for me anyway.  More for later!

Summary: great variety of food, friendly staff, ample creativity in dishes, good prices, I just wish the crepe to food ratio was a little higher.  That's not enough of a deterrent to keep me away, though.",2011-10-02 18:19:01

Well, we thought there was going to see a Thai boy-band named Skinny Jeans performing. That's what the LV Weekly had told us, and we were up for a kitchy evening! When we arrived, however, there appeared to just be karaoke. I turned to my husband and asked, ""Can we handle this?""

We decided we could.

Little did we know that this was not some average karoake. Everyone in the restaurant was Thai, and they were all mesmerized by the female singer. We were told she was a famous singer from Thailand vacationing in Vegas. We were a little dubious until we saw someone hand her what appeared to be a roll of hundred dollar bills. That's famous money. 

They definitely have the Thai vibe under control. On this evening, we could have been in Thailand. There was lots of cheering and dancing to accompany the singing. 

I had always been hesitant to try Marnee because the reviews were average to bad. However, I think there may be a new chef in town. When we went to pay, we were actually greeted by the ""new"" chef who told us she was ""training."" She is Thai, but has traditionally worked in Chinese kitchens. 

If she is only in ""training,"" then I am excited. We had panang curry and pad kea mow. Both were well-executed, not the least bit greasy and filled with quality, fresh ingredients. The pad kea mow was probably the best flavored noodle dish I have had in town- intense, aka delicious, wok char and topped with a pile of fresh, green cilantro. We unfortunately ordered them a tad too spicy (a 6 out of 10), so I wasn't able to enjoy them as much as I potentially could have. 

Sadly, no brown rice, but the service was impeccable. They were friendly (apologizing for the singing, which was unnecessary) and attentive. Our water glasses were never less than half full. I do wish there was a bit more light, but I guess when you're hosting the famous, they like to have a little privacy.",2011-05-03 05:26:41

Crisp Chicken Skins ($7) Sweet Chili Vinegar- Can someone tell me how this could possibly be bad? Like Thanksgiving, but better. An order brings out four pieces of super crispy skin packed with rich poultry flavour. A little greasy on the fingers, yes, but the bright tangy dip helped to balance out the fat. 

Cheese Croquettes ($9)Apple-Chipotle Sauce- A warning to those wearing your fancy pants to dinner. Safety first with this one, folks. Secure the napkin on your lap and chest, and then lean over the side plate-these little bombs of hot cheese will explode upon contact. But let me tell you- messy ain't got nothing on deliciousness with these little bites. Crispy on the outside, and ooey gooey cheesy goodness within- I also liked the spicy sweet dipping sauce to cut the fat. Yes, please.

Queso de Cabeza ($13) Fried Suckling Pig, Pork n' Beans, Hen's Egg, Pickled Beets- One of my favourite dishes of the night because who doesn't like breakfast for dinner? The beans were sweet, salty and starchy, absolutely delicious with the fall apart tender suckling pig and the luscious runny yolk. What made the dish, though, was the unexpected addition of the pickled beets. With so much fatty goodness of the plate, that little bit of tangy veg just brightened everything up. I would totally consider just ordering this as my main.

Raw Salad ($12) Avocado, Pear, Radish, Shaved Coconut, Jicama, Peruvian Peppers, Coriander, Lime Vinaigrette- This is what I think we're going to see more of this 2014- chefs making vegetables super hot. This raw salad was a great example. With so many bright flavours, contrasting colours and irresistible freshness going on, even a hard-core carnivore would be enticed to try this. The vinaigrette was definitely more on the acidic side, which is my preference so I loved it, but those who preferring more neutral flavour may feel there was too much citrus. I do think those people suck.

Pit Master's Platter for 2 ($58) Ribs, Beef Brisket, Jalapeno Sausage, Pulled Pork, Turkey- I wish this platter were available for one person, because if two people ordered this, they couldn't have room for anything else, and thou shalt not make a meal of meat alone (unless you're down with a mean case of the meat sweats, of course). Regardless of the portion size, everything on the platter was super delicious. The ribs were a favourite amongst my group but I fell in love with the deckle bits with all the smoky bark - oh my lord, that was good. There wasn't anything on that platter I didn't love, I just wish it was possible to purchase a smaller portion.

Jalapeno Sausage (with platter)- Despite being part of the platter, the sausage came alone (maybe not enough space!), but was one of the best bits of the meal. These were some of the juiciest, most flavourful sausages I've had in a while, and the hint of jalapeno really offset the fat. Deliciousness all around.

Goat Ribs ($18, Fridays only)- I was really happy we ordered this, as they ended up being (in my opinion) even more delicious than the pork ribs. Surprisingly tender, with a good level of smoke and very little fat. If you happen to be here on a Friday, definitely get these ribs.

The Big Rib ($35)-Cumbrae Farm's Pit Fired & Braised Beef Rib, Savoy Cabbage, Parsley, Mustard, Horseradish, Pickled Relish- Hands down, everyone's favourite dish of the night. The smoke and braising method yielded a massive hunk of meat that was both smoky and well caramelized but also impossibly tender. Sweet, sticky, rich and savoury all at once. I also liked how the bright zippy horseradish in the herbaceous parsley salad refreshed the traditionally heavy winter main. A bit pricey, yes, but absolutely delish.

TCB Slaw with Corn Nuts (accompaniment to Goat Ribs)- It was a small portion as it came with the goat but man, was it ever good slaw. The dressing had a perfect ratio of creaminess and tang, while the contrast of the crunchy sweet corn nuts and supple cabbage was addictive. I would highly recommend this side.

""Hot Mess"" ($11) Sweet Potato, Cheese Curds, Crema, Pickled Jalapeno, Chopped Brisket-This dish is nothing to look at but, its definitely damn tasty, albeit a bit heavy amidst the meat heavy mains. The ratio of sweet pillowy potato and spicy jalapeno paled in comparison to the mountain of stringy cheese, the tangy crema and the rich beef brisket.  Somehow, although I had reached my meat-threshold, I still wanted to eat it all. My suggestion to make this perfect would be to use a larger sweet potato, making the $11 price tag seem more palatable and helping to balance out the heavy toppings.

Banana Toffee Cream Pie ($16)- Growing up, one of my favourite desserts of all time was banoffee pie, and TCB's version didn't disappoint. Delicate flaky pastry, generous chunks of ripe bananas, thick luxurious ribbons of toffee and a mountain of cream on top. It perhaps sounds quite sweet and rich, but this pie was surprisingly light.

My 3 year old daughter loves fried dumplings - these dumplings were perfectly crisped and filled with meat and veggies.  
I had the tofu soup with kimchi - my husband had tofu soup with beef.
I think the key word to the dishes is ""tofu"" here, folks.  There's tons of tofu, maybe not enough of the kimchi or beef to help differentiate the soups, but it's there, and I have to say, compared to Buk Chang Dong, I love how Tofu Village is brightly lit, clean, service being attentive, side dishes different than BCD's, and the soup was not overly salty.  My biggest complaint when I go out to eat is how parched I am by the time I come home - from BCD, I definitely need a few liters of water to wash down the salt factor.

I've been a couple times but after they were listed as one of the best churros in the city (among other places) by BlogTo, my partner wanted to go on a churro spree. So this was our first destination. The churros are fresh and the service is so friendly. There's usually always a little bit of a line, but the service is fast and efficient and the wait time is not long at all. I believe it's $1.50 for a single churro, $4 for 5 churros, and $13 for 12 churros. In my opinion the dulce de leche and chocolate are the best churro fillings but you can get it plain or with strawberry filling (and maybe a couple others).

It can be a bit messy to eat but it's perfect for a cool weather snack/dessert.

My one issue is that this place is cash only and I never carry cash (so it's quite inconvenient for someone like me). However, if I know I'm going to be in the area before hand, I try to keep some change on me :P",2016-02-03 16:52:31

My guy goes to Palace Station for the sports book, but I rarely venture in myself. This spot was a lot better than expected and is a big upgrade from the previous forgettable restaurant!

MEATBALL APP: Get it, they're just as good as sibling Pizza Rock's version. 3/$5 is enough to share, they're huge and swimming in a great sauce. Save it for dipping your pizza crusts.
HOT HOUSE MADE CALABRESE SAUSAGE: I almost didn't get this after reading the menu description that said it was sauteed in local honey, but I'm glad my guy suggested it. Spicy sausage meets sweet sauce, surprisingly balanced with good but not overwhelming heat.
CAPRESE HOUSE SPECIAL SALAD: The small is still big enough to share, but I found this salad overdressed and underwhelming. The mozz was good, but there were barely any peppers or olives. All of the produce was super fresh though.
THE STATION PIZZA: Classic meat-heavy pizza with pepperoni, salami, linguica, bacon, bell pepper, olives, tomatoes, and two types of onions. Overflowing with toppings, you can share a 9"" small and still be satisfied. My guy and I both agreed we'd get this again.
CAL ITALIA: One of their featured award-winning pies, with four cheeses, sweet fig preserves, prosciutto, and balsamic drizzle. I've had similar pies and enjoyed them, but the balsamic almost overwhelmed this version. Still good, but not great.
SAUTEED SPINACH: Where can you find shareable sides for only $3 these days?! This order was a huge heap of spinach, lightly seasoned and an awesome addition to our otherwise heavy dishes. 
CARAMEL BREAD PUDDING: I'm not much of a bread pudding fan, but it was my guy's choice and it was actually pretty good. Served in a cute skillet, caramel flavors are only hints rather than a punch in the mouth, good for sharing.

Service was attentive and friendly throughout, wish I'd caught the guy's name because I'd request him again. Seat yourself, snag a cushy booth if you can. Note that they have lunch specials and HH specials to take advantage of, as well as the occasional deal up on Groupon.",2016-08-05 07:06:07

The service was decent, however, some of our dinnerwares and glass was dirty, a big NO NO and turn off at a restaurant :(

We ordered the beef curry, tandoori chicken (half), and some garlic naan on the side. The beef curry tasted quite good, and the meat was cooked perfectly where it easily falls apart. The tandoori chicken was also marinated well and tasted good. However, the garlic naan had too much butter to which I didn't like.

Overall, 2 stars because the food at this place is pretty good if you are looking for some Indian food, not sure about the authenticity though. But they need to do a better job on cleaning their dishes, wouldn't be happy to see dirty dishes again if I decide to come here again.",2017-08-11 03:28:47

I've now been able to stop in here twice and have been pleasantly surprised each time.

Located on Stephanie just north of Paseo Verde, 346 Patisserie is Vegas', err Henderson's newest gelato/dessert shop. This bright little shop is doing things a bit different than just about everyone else in town though. Not only do they offer a constantly rotating gelato selection, but they also rotate a pretty large variety of other treat items too. From flavored marshmallows and macarons, to cookies, croissants, tarts and even rarely seen basque cakes. What 346 does though is perfectly summed up by Shirley B. and her example of combining art and science into their treats. On that note alone, it's worth stopping by just to see what they're all about.

On our first visit, we walked in only about 15 minutes from closing. Even so, Amber was more than willing to talk to us and explain their concepts, all while letting us sample anything we wanted. The level of service she offers definitely matches the product. You can tell she is extremely passionate about what her and husband do. It's also very clear that they are knowledgable about their products and have spent a lot of time developing them. With that being said, it's also pretty neat to hear them talk about experimenting with things and even bringing them out for customers. As an example, she let us know about some new truffle infused croissants they are working on and will be offering up in the next week or so. It's cool to hear that they are willing to do things that really aren't done very often, and they aren't afraid to take feedback that could easily go either way. 

Now that we have been here on a couple occasions, we've got to try a few different things. We've mainly come for gelato, but that doesn't mean their other dessert items aren't excellent either. So far every gelato flavor we've tried has been extremely on point and didn't disappoint in the slightest. A great tip first posted by Lore D. is that they'll even do half scoops for you at no additional charge. Not only does this give you an opportunity to get more flavors without having too much, but you can do so without spending extra money. The gelato itself has a very good texture that's both creamy and smooth making for a near perfect gelato mouthfeel. Stand outs for me have been Toasted Almond, Ghost Pepper and Jasmine Milk Tea. Each of these brought an exact flavor that you expected with each and every bite. 

The toppings for the gelato is another area where 346 shines for me. Using the art and science example is perfect when you talk about their topping choices. Using liquid nitrogen, Amber takes ordinary items and turns them into something special. A toasted marshmallow turns into a delicate combination of crunchy and gooey little bites with just a hint of smokiness. Ordinary honey turns into a frozen strand that almost resembles pieces of glass, yet as it warms up just melts in your mouth. And chocolate mousse transforms into crunchy bits of chocolate flavor bursts. So far, not a single one of the toppings has let me down. Not to mention, it's pretty fun to watch them being made.

But as I said, 346 isn't just about gelato. Their treat selection is just as good. We've only tried a couple different things, but stand outs for me so far were the Salted Caramel Tart and macarons. I had both a Raspberry macaron and a Black & White Truffle macaron that were both excellent. Their ability to present the flavor without being overpowering speaks for itself. The macarons themselves are executed well and some of the better ones you can get in town if you ask me.

Price-wise they are a little bit on the high side. With everything being made in house though, I understand why there's a higher premium. As the old saying goes, you get what you pay for. And at 346, that's high quality desert with a lot of passion and forward-thinking behind it. Regardless of the distance, we'll definitely be regulars.",2015-04-05 17:45:54

Recently came here for Happy Hour after a day of shopping for some new furniture, last one being nearby at Living Spaces in Boca Park, across the street. 

Conveniently located in Tivoli Village, in one of the ""corners"" of the round about, directly across from Echo & Rig. This location doesn't seem as big as the Town Square location. 

Since we were there for Happy Hour, you just walk to the bar area and sit down at any open area. There was a small table open between two parties so we sat there. 

Beef Carpaccio - Shaved tender beef, field greens, capers, mustard aioli, Parmigiano Reggiano, Parmesan flatbread

Regular item i've always gotten during Happy Hour. Simple carpaccio brightened up with capers and aioli. 

Margherita Flatbread - Vine-ripened tomatoes, Mozzarella, basil

Originally my mom wanted to get the caprese salad for the mozzarella but i told her we had the same mozzarella at home. Got this instead. Really thin, crispy flatbread with paper thin slices of tomatoes and basil. Mozzarella was kind of missing. XD maybe that was paper thin as well and melted away... Mildly plain tasting though the thin, crispy flatbread was yummy. 

Potato Skins - Applewood bacon, Cheddar cheese sauce, green onion, lime crema 

Surprisingly, i liked this one the most. Fingerling sized potatoes baked/fried/whatever'ed to point with some crisp edges, crispy bacon, and fresh green onions. Ask for a extra side of the sauce ! (this was the waiters suggestion) Though it tastes like sour cream, but makes sense if it was a lime cream. Lol 

White Peach Sangria - Chardonnay, Peach Schnapps, strawberries, cherries, citrus fruits

Light tasting sangria. refreshing though on a hot day. 

I had some pineapple drink with pineapple soaked vodka, and some other stuff which tasted like pineapple juice. That was pretty good too except i think they put too much ice, so mine disappeared pretty fast. 

Overall, can't complain about the happy hour. Served it's purpose of giving alcohol and snacks for a cheap price ! Ha ! this was my super early dinner because i had to sleep early *snore*",2018-09-16 21:28:32

The lemonade was a good take on that. I managed to steer clear of the bakery case. I would give this a 3-1/2 but the folks are so friendly I had to round up instead of down.,2016-03-19 18:45:42

We visit Las Vegas several times a year, and we wanted to find good pancakes at a reasonable price, which meant off the Strip. Now my wife is addicted and we must stop whenever in town. Her favorite: Chocolate Chip pancakes. My favorite: Strawberry pancakes, and bacon. The prices are reasonable, portions are big, and service is friendly and quick. Since this is a franchise, you can check your area for one, but from our experience the prices and service vary.

We enjoy their awesome pancakes so much, we hunted online and found what is supposedly their recipe so we can enjoy them when 300 miles away in Phoenix. Ours don't come out as good, but it's definitely better than local restaurants or Bisquick!",2012-02-05 21:12:30

We were greeted by two people who were both funny and interesting. The restaurant was kept very well, clean and pleasant atmosphere, although not in a Vietnamese atmosphere, this place was a Japanese restaurant and Chinese restaurant before it was this. But its nice regardless. And I am sure hoping they got a good deal on the space.
We ordered the shrimp cold summer type rolls, grilled pork pho and lean chicken pho and a coconut drink and preserved lemon drink.
The summer roll was fresh and delicious. The phos were fantastic! The grilled pork pho was extraordinary, the broth and ingredients were fresh and tasty. The ""white boy"" pho, the chicken, was light and perfect. 
The coconut was a real one not some outta the can, and the preserved lemon drink was authentic and good.
They have a contest pho that is gigantic...if you can eat it in 15 minutes its free!
We will definitely be going back! LOVED this place! Thanks Yelp for getting us there.

The chef/owner(Charlie) is funny, entertaining, and cooked at pho87 in Los Angeles under his mother for 22 years before opening this place here. His experience and care with the ingredients really shows.",2010-01-15 19:19:12

However, as a valley food lover I must say bravo to yet another successful venture, Mr. Fox!

I am rating Zinburger a 4 purely in alignment with the other restaurants I've experienced. While it may not be as sophisticated as Modern Steak or trendy like Olive & Ivy, Zinburger has a sleek setting with a great casual outdoor bar and some delicious food!

We started with Sweet Potato Fries with Yogurt Dipping Sauce, Double Truffle Fries (Truffle Aioli & Truffle Oil) and Zucchini Fries (Parmesan & Ranch). All of them were good and would definitely satisfy any salt cravings you might have - so make sure you have a Zin Stinger (Red Zinfandel, Chocolate Sauce, Simple Syrup, Mint Leaves) close at hand!

There were 4 of use, we tried the Turkey Burger (with Swiss Cheese, Avocado & Mayo), Samburger (with Nueske's Applewood Smoked Bacon, American Cheese & Thousand Island Dressing), Buffalo Chicken Sandwich (with Pepperjack Cheese & Ranch Dressing) and lastly the Kobe Burger (with Cheddar Cheese, Wild Mushrooms & Mayo). They were all fantastic, The Kobe and the Turkey were my favorites.

We passed on the shakes for dessert and went for the Banana Creme Pie (YUM!!) and Chocolate Creme Pie. They give you 1/4th of a pie!!! It's a huge slice. I am pretty sure at this point, I should have stopped but when staff recommended the Bacon Bloody Mary, how could this foodie resist?? 

That's right...Bacon-Infused Vodka. The Bacon Bloody Mary.
Because I am hardcore, I went for it. It was really good, I just wouldn't recommend pairing that with Dessert and wouldn't do it again.

All in all, a great experience typical of FoxRC. I'll be back for more, and really enjoyed the relaxed experience and patio at the Biltmore Fashion Park.",2010-03-21 02:21:01
vNBlIzcqzRbkccfjl-zAEA,6Us9B_oc2YR7JjW9USeBhA,AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg,5,5,2,2,"Mind blown!!! I feel guilty giving anywhere else a five star rating after coming here, because it's in a league of its own. As an expert in fine dining, I can honestly say this is the best restaurant experience in America. Better than Alinea, Eleven Madison Park, and the famous French Laundry. Period. This chef deserves a James Beard Award more than anyone else. It should have multiple Michelin stars.

It's in the beautiful Wild Horse Pass hotel. The decor is modern with Native American influences. The windows allow you to watch the beautiful sunset while you dine. From a view perspective, it's impeccable! The wait staff is incredible. We had 10 different waiters, each of which were unbelievably knowledgeable regarding the menu. They intricately explained each course, the chef's inspiration, and the sourcing of ingredients. The staff bends over backwards to make you feel like royalty.

We did the 13 course tasting menu. They do have abnormal menu and a shorter tasting menu option (only 7 courses). But, I'd highly recommend the 13 courses, as it allows you to try nearly everything. It's called the journey, which is quite fitting.

The courses were as follows:

Foie gras amuse

Hahl soup with 32 hour brisket and prickly pear cotton candy - cotton candy melts as you eat it

Hand picked lettuces

The Preserved Garden

Foie gras and apple pie - The best foie gras I've ever had.

Elixir

Dusted hebi with tuna tartare and squid ink

Festival of seasons NY strip

Coconut taramind palate cleanser sorbet

Tenderloin of tribal buffalo

Cheese course

Deconstructed tiramisu.

Then, they bring local herbs in a wood bowl with rocks and dry ice. They pour tea over to and it smokes for a good 10 minutes, filling the entire room with a relaxing aroma. This was the absolute best culinary feat I've ever seen. More so than Grant Achatz's dessert balloons at Alinea. Epic, purely epic.

So, five hours later, we finished. As if the above experience weren't enough, the chef came out from the kitchen and greeted us. As we left, they put a thank you card, two Voss water bottles, and some homemade jelly in the car. All in all, the best restaurant in America. Well worth the price tag!!",2016-12-25 02:49:12

I then looked around and saw other people with baseball caps on as well. So we asked if my boyfriend needs to remove his baseball cap then so should the others. The bus lady / clean up lady claims she asked the other guy to remove it 3 times. I find it funny that she can supposedly ask someone to remove a hat 3 times and it's ok. But of course she asked my boyfriend once or her would be ""kicked out"" after 2 hours of sitting somewhere come on. So anyways my guy took off his hat. As we're waiting for our check there was a guy next to us and he had a regular black tee shirt on. They told him He has to have a ""proper shirt on or get out"" they then had him come over to the bar and ""pay a shirt fee"" wtf??!! This place is wayyyyy to worried about baseball hats and plain tees on certain people. If you know what I mean... If you guys are going to have a ""dress code"" it should be the same for everyone.

I usually go for the lemon aloe juice, its more on the sweet side even though I asked for less sugar, maybe there isn't anything they can do about it ...

Also tried the deep fried chicken (鹽酥雞）which is like a must EVERY TIME I try new bbt places and when its offered...its so bad for me but I so love it.... =p

A lot of seniors live up the hill and patronize the breakfast/lunch only places a lot more than anything that is open in the evenings. So having something open until 10p as well as drive-thru really floats our boat. These are the kinds of items we prefer to eat, as a hunk of anything is often too much---meat, chicken. What I have liked so far are the soups (potato and enchilada) and the tuna sandwich (fantastic moist hazelnut bread, filling a bit meager). What I haven't liked is running the engine waiting in line for food I called in. I'd prefer the way other restaurants do it, bringing it out to you when you call from the car. I found the French dip sand inedible, but my dog ate the filling (cheez!). I threw out the ""au jus"" which tasted somewhat chemical to me. The orange roll is awful--also fake tasting. They apparently keep everything chilled, and that's the way you get it. After letting the chocolate bundt cake thaw out, it was okay. The coconut pineapple cake had very little flavor. The OJ, frozen, was better than most (can't beat the fresh OJ at Jamba Juice).   Lavazza coffee is a great brand, but I didn't care for theirs.

Sorry guys, you are on your own. Inside the club is dark and has lots of open space. The outside area I like better. There are spas and pools and tree boxes that you can sit on. You can also see the strip and it has a pretty view. Much more quite outside, so you can actually sit and talk. I was not too fond of the music they played and not much people were dancing. Getting in and out of the nightclub is kind of a nightmare! To get in- I'm only speaking from experience with my promoter, but we all had to meet downstairs and she only brought girls in as groups- not your personal group, but like a group group. She told people to meet at a certain time, and so whoever was on her list, I think she waited until all or most of them showed up then walked in about 20 or so girls at the same time. I understand that this saves her time, but you don't exactly feel VIP when it's done in that manner either. Every other club that I've had a promoter for, you went in with just the people you came with, not waiting for everyone to gather like cattle. Anyways, we met downstairs and so had to go back upstairs to get in and the entrance was wrapped around the back so I did not really like that being in heels. Also when you leave, oh geesh, talk about the worse stairs ever!! The entrance leads you to the back, like the back outside of a building! It's all metal stairs and endless amounts of them!! Every girl I saw freaked out at the stairs that lead us out and held on the the rails for dear life! Seriously, metal stairs leading to what like an outside back entrance with girls wearing like 4-5 inch heels... that's an accident waiting to happen!! They should at least put grips in the stairs or carpet somewhere so that it's not as accident prone! Just the thought of the exit makes me not want to come back to the club.

I know this because it's been around almost as long as I have been and I grew up in the neighborhood. The Valley National Bank next door is long gone and the strip center has remodeled, but the deli is in the same spot.

It has not changed much over the years. The same 1970s paneling is on the walls, and the Saguaro senior class photos still dominate the decor. 

The primary difference between the sausage sub I ate in my youth to the one I had yesterday is the bread today is better: a solid crunch on the roll while still light inside. My wife's chicken steak was tasty, and the marinara is awesome. I didn't get to try a bit of my parents' cold subs but they finished them both happily. 

Everyone behind the counter that I saw was a family member (again, I grew up in the neighborhood: if you went to Mohave & Saguaro in the 70s & 80's or you went to St. Maria's you knew or knew of the Casella's) and this means they will close for summer vacation in July and close during the Christmas holidays to take a break.

Customer service left much to be desired. Everyone moved so slowly it was awkward. There was no long line. Think Tin Man before the oil, every movement was slow and painful to watch. It wasn't new business organizational kinks. It was individual sloth. They also weren't very peppy.

Frozen Pop Corn Also tried the Ranch frozen pop corn. They make it really cool with nitrogen and it is best to eat immediately.

The VIP section is where it's at so if you can fork up a couple extra bucks for a VIP ticket, do it. It's usually worth it for the extra standing room, designated bar and restrooms. 

The drinks are SUPER expensive here so most people pre-game before the concert and just buy one or two drinks while at the concert. A large canned beer can cost about $7 or $9. The bar service is usually great and the Fillmore staff is always friendly and excited about the bands playing.

The sandwiches were AMAZING and full of flavor. The oatmeal was good once I found some honey to add for added sweetness as the fruit on the oatmeal (Blueberry, raspberry, blackberry and banana) was good but I wanted a little more sweetness so I grabbed some honey from my hotel lobby and that made it perfect. 
The food was hot and fresh and again very tasty. So good in fact that during our two hour lunch break during training I ordered lunch from here via the UberEATS app again.

Chara ordered the small house salad and likewise it was more than large enough for her. The mixed greens were fresh and beautiful and she loved the vinaigrette they paired with it. 
For dessert we each chose a different cheesecake and then shared! Salted Caramel, Godiva and Tiramisu. Each was pure perfection and ended our meal perfectly. Jenna had even decorated Rhyans and included a candle! We got to sing Happy Birthday and it was a really sweet note to end on. My birthday is NYE... think I wanna go back!",2017-12-30 20:50:23
MhThJ4RSLilbN7E8sz05Wg,s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,LJt-NO2FhvQxTmBoaaLhTg,3,2,1,1,"I have now been to Three Angry Wives four times for Corned Beef & Cabbage, and this dish has been spot on excellent each time! Without question it is the best Corned Beef & Cabbage I have tasted in Las Vegas or anywhere else to date. Along with a choice of yummy mashed potatoes or a baked potato, over half a head of fresh, buttery cabbage is served on a ceramic platter--not a plate--with enough large cuts of the leanest corned beef to easily last two meals for even the most gluttonous of diners. One of my tablemates yearned for boiled potatoes--which would seem to be appropriate to accompany this traditional Irish dish--but they are not available as an option. Entrees also come with a choice of soup or salad, and two large slices of fairly respectable garlic bread. On this night, Chicken Noodle Soup was the soup of choice. A cup of the soup was clearly homemade, with tasty broth, but the chicken meat was cut in squared off brick-like chunks, and mushy flat noodles drooped listlessly over my spoon because they had been cooked too long. Salad was a nice portion of iceberg lettuce with cherry tomatoes and cucumber slices, accompanied by a choice of dressings. Unfortunately, the dressing came in a small plastic container--a bit too casual for my taste at a sit-down restaurant--although the Italian variety was good and hearty--not insipid like many. The real highlight of the salad was the addition of a generous amount of light, crunchy croutons circulating on top. 

I sampled my wife's lightly battered cod in her order of Fish & Chips, and it was moist and tasty; and slightly creamy Cole Slaw was good. Moreover, an appetizer of Tater Skins was all I hoped it would be: deep-flavored pieces of bacon spread over a cheesy layer of melted Cheddar Cheese resting atop about half an inch of perfectly cooked potato, with green onions and sour cream available for sprinkling and spooning over the five skins. 

But excellent food does not alone make a restaurant great! While our leather booth in the smoke-free section of the restaurant that is glassed off from the cavernous pub was comfortable, a raw gash in the black wood of our table was a bit disconcerting. Although one drink was served to the wrong person, and drink refills had to be requested, servers were amiable and competent, and service was generally good. But the kitchen was far too slow in fulfilling orders. Our soup and salad were brought out about 15 minutes after ordering, and the Tater Skins arrived about 30 minutes after that. Then, as I feared, five minutes later our entrees arrived. So, soup and salad vaulted over what was supposed to be our starter, and the appetizer was served just a few minutes before the entrees arrived on its virtual heel, overlapping not yet eaten Tater Skins. 

When the bill arrived, prices seemed reasonable for the high quality and large quantity of food provided ($16 for the Corned Beef & Cabbage and $14 for Fish & Chips), but it seemed a bit extreme to me to charge a friend 75 cents for a thimbleful of requested Thousand Island dressing and another 50-cent open food charge for onions to be added to his Limerick Burger. He was also unhappy that his toasted hamburger bun was cold on arrival. And, another friend complained that her baked potato was too hard. So, all in all, this was at best an overall 3-1/2-stars experience. Regardless, I will still come back here again and again for the great Corned Beef & Cabbage that Three Angry Wives consistently turns out.",2011-07-01 11:47:53

My mom ordered tickets ahead of time, thinking it would save time. We stood in line for at least 10 minutes while one person handled will-call and decided to make small talk with everyone in front of us. Luckily they opened another line in ""new memberships"" so we jumped over there thinking it would be faster... nope. We were literally second in line and watched the original line that we were in move along. 

After we finally got our wristbands we were able to walk around the center while we waited for our time spot for Pompeii. It was nice that they staggered times for groups to go in which prevented too many people. I will say that a little bit more time between groups would have been nice but it wasn't out of control. I didn't feel rushed at all but be prepared to have to wait for people to move along - at times it felt like herding cattle! One suggestion I have would be to add a few more benches. Standing for that long with no where to sit was rough. 

The Pompeii exhibit was simply amazing. We took our kids (5, 8, and 9) and they didn't understand or appreciate the exhibit. Also, the end shows like mummified kids and adults which was too much for our kids so my husband had to rush through that part with them. I highly suggest leaving the little ones at home or bring someone who can keep them busy in the Science Center. 

5 stars for the exhibit but 3 stars for will-call... having an issue at the entrance to the Science Center is off putting but overall we're enjoyed our time there.",2018-05-31 04:19:34

She proceeded to tell us that they had an exterminator come in twice a week and then went and got the manager. He apologized and acted like he was just as shocked as she was. They both saw the cockroaches crawling around and did the whole ""OMG!! I cannot beeeelieeeve this!!!"" act.

This place is like therapy for me. It just feels wrong to sweep your peanut shells onto the ground. It's quite liberating. I don't normally go to places that ""crunch"" when you walk around. The peanuts are free & are in little buckets on the tables & bar.

There are tv's everywhere! They're usually playing sports.

I haven't been out on the patio yet. I'm not a smoker. From what I've seen it looks like a nice patio.

-- First time I was here was on a Mon. The place was pretty dead, except for the bar. Can be kind of hard to get seats at the bar because of how small it is.

Tim was working & Autumn was training. Very nice people. Tim's quite the comedian at times. He's good at his job. I asked for a drink recommendation. He asked what flavors I like. I told him I like fruity but not overly sweet. He recommended a drink to me that was very similar to what I've ordered before. His was great though. He had me pegged, spot on.

Only thing that was bummer is MGD is NOT a drink special on Mon. That's a misprint :(

-- The second time was very different. Came in on Fri around 8-9ish. Got a booth & ordered food.

I had the Seafood Pasta which was a special for $12.99 if I remember correctly. Olive Garden has a dish that's similar (& usually better). It wasn't humongous. I managed to finish it all & not feel stuffed. The seafood part was delicious. The shrimp, mussels, clams were all tasty. There was one clam that didn't open. Why was it put on my plate? The sauce was lacking though. It was some kind of oily white wine sauce. Could have used more of it on my plate. It just needed more oomph to it. Still not a bad dish, but I've had better. Their strawberry lemonade wasn't too bad. A little watered down though.

There was live music. Fun :) The first band was good. They had a mandolin. Insta-points! They played a Bravery cover & did a good job. More points! The second bad (oops, I accidentally typed ""bad"". Freudian slip?) was meh. Too loud. Too older-gentlemen-trying-to-hold-onto-their-youth-by-being-in-a-garage-band. We left.

I don't go here often, I save it for those special ""I-really-want-to-treat-myself"" lunches.  Maybe when there are co-workers visiting from out of town or when I'm going with a good friend for a sit-down-and-chat lunch, not a grab-and-go lunch.  Although, you can call it in or get take out if you want.

This is food that I want to sit down, pay attention, and enjoy.  My favorite is the Panang (Peanut Curry) with Tofu and Veggies, medium or mild, depending on the day.  I like spicy, but I also like to taste my food and try to prevent my nose from running too much.  It comes with the delicious Jasmine Rice, a spring roll, and a small cup of soup to start.  If I'm trying to be good, I save half for the next day.  If not, I could eat the whole thing - easy!

Also, it is very hard not to get a Thai Iced Tea while I am here.  I am a huge iced tea fan in general (unsweetened, with lemon), but when there is a beverage as creamy and wonderful as this, my willpower can instantly fall to zero. 

It is a pretty tight fit with all of the tables in there and it can get a little loud.  However, the servers are nice and they don't linger.  It is amazing how they try to be as speedy as they can so that they can get everyone seated, yet I never feel rushed.  If I want a long, leisurely lunch, I can have that, the difference is that it will be because I decided to, and not because they took to long.

No music or anything on so conversations are a little awkward to have when everyone can hear.. Restaurant not ready for opening. On top of that owners not here one of the main reasons smaller restaurants like this fail. Still decided to try the food.

So I go in and look at the menu restaurant style is teriyaki madness-ish. Prices are restaurant range. Beef shrimp combo 16$ for a pretty small portion. Twice the price for half the food at Panda Express or teriyaki madness which are the closest comparable restaurants. Two entrees and two drinks 40$. 

Still I don't like to write negative reviews and wasn't going to if it weren't for the lack of service and wait time. I then decided to politely return a meal I took a bite out of since it completely tasted like pepper (beef yakisoba) and had to wait 25 minutes to try and return it. A lot of people waiting long wait times for orders.


Wouldn't go back. I always try to find the good in places and be as optimistic as possible but this restaurant just didn't do it for me.

I discovered this place when I was searching for no MSG and this place basically announced it loudly. So I was curious to try it when I got the chance. 

So far I only tried the tonkotsu ramen two variants of it. The secret sauce and the soy sauce versions. They're both good and they had ample chunks of meat. They have some brown coloured eggs which also add a bit of flavour.

The soy sauce one adds a bit more saltiness as expected. The flavour is not as strong. 

The one thing I didn't like is there is no refill on the yummy noodles. So it's not the place to go if you want to do cheap carbo load. 

Though if you are not a heavy eater it's good enough. 

I may update my review once I find the ramen I like here. There are still other ramen I would like to try.

Since this place does not do any MSG I will try to visit more often and hopefully when I find the food that satiates my palate I will be able to give this place five stars.

Do not judge a book by it's cover or in this case do not let the sign outside fool you!

This is  really nice little place for college students to come for lunch or breaks during classes. The white tiles gives it clean cut  look and it also reminded me of a Polish sausage factory.

I had the Chicago dog, which was delicious! All the flavors complimented each other well, no need to ketchup at all. Can't wait to try the other dogs. 

Waffle ice cream sandwich was AWESOME. The chocolate chips and the freshness of the waffle really gives it the amazing factor. Another great thing is that it's simple yet perfect at the same time. Sometimes desserts go overboard with sweetness, but this is just right. MUST TRY!

But since I was dining alone I had no problems getting a seat as I just shimmied up to the bar. The dining alone thing has really opened my eyes to a new way of experiencing restaurants. Because you're at the bar, the staff chit-chat with you more, you're better taken care of, and you get to see some of the inner workings that you wouldn't notice sitting at a table.

I sent with the hash at the suggestion of the staff. It was great. A nice sized portion that didn't leave me feeling bloated or regretful after I left.

Then I found Mr. Mama on Yelp. We headed over for breakfast before heading to Red Canyon...there was a 30 minute wait, but if this place is THAT packed and people are waiting with no problem (and they have over 1,000 reviews...) we knew it'd be worth the wait.

I'm still pretty blown away by how good it actually was. You know the feeling...you read the reviews...you see the photos...you over hype a place in your mind so much so that when you actually eat there it's a let down. Well, not here. Mr. Mama delivered! 

First, we have to start with the hostess - who is Mr. Mama's daughter. She greeted everyone with a smile. Handled the list like a pro. Bussed tables. Sat people. Even helped bring out plates. We had to tell her at the end of the meal how awesome she was - I really meant it. That place runs like clockwork mainly because of her. She made it a point to say her dad taught her - love family run businesses!

Ok, so on to the food.

Giant Cinnamon Roll - fluffy, gooey, sweet, delicious. WHOA! Get this. Mind you it really IS MASSIVE...so share it. But man, this was hands down the best cinnamon roll I've ever had. *come to think of it, it was the only homemade cinnamon roll I have ever had, but still....get it!

Choice of meat and eggs - 2 eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast. $6.75. WHAT? First of all, it was delicious - BUT THAT PRICE THOUGH!?!?! It's crazy they can make a profit on it. The hashbrowns were great. Eggs are eggs...and the bacon was thick and crispy! It was quality food...at a super discounted price!

The wife had the Cali omelet (minus the sausage) - I took a bite and it was delicious as well.

The coffee they serve was also really good. They bring little french vanilla creamers which might not impress most people, but I thought it was a super nice touch.

Overall, we left stuffed and only spent ~$25. If we lived in Vegas I'd be the DUKE of this place, I have no doubt about it. If you're in town visiting and looking for a great meal on the cheap...hit it up! As for you locals....I envy you.",2015-01-06 15:19:59

But I will say, we eat at Carrabas probably 10 times a month. It is one of our favorite restaurants. On this visit,  we were ordering. I Ordered my usual salad. Steve asks me if I want to add blue cheese and I say ""Sure"" then I say, ""I have never been asked that before, is that something new?"" To which Steve says, ""no, I always ask everybody if they want blue cheese"" and I said ""Oh"" so I said ""Sure, I will add blue cheese"" then he proceeds with my  husband's salad and asks if he wants blue cheese, my husband said ""no"".  Another wait staff member walks by.. Steve, in a proud like manner says ""Hey! Who adds on the most blue cheese here?""  The waitress said ""You do Steve"" not missing a beat or a step and just kept walking. So, I said to Steve, "" Why is it such a proud accomplishment to be the highest ranking blue cheese giver at Carrabas, is there an up charge for it or something?""  To which Steve replied ""Yes, but it's only $2. And you get a nice big chuck of blue cheese"". And then I said ""Well, you didn't mention the $2 up charge Steve."" And he said  (in a gentlemanly cocky and arrogant way) ""I said would you like to ""ADD"" blue cheese, that's how I do it"" and I said ""You are a rat, I don't want the blue cheese"".   So moral of my story, In MY PROSPECTIVE or PERCEPTION, whatever you wanna call it, Steve is a scammer.  And the only reason he is top blue cheese sales guy is his ability to ""fake"" people into thinking he is just adding a nice chunk of blue cheese on their salad. I guarantee you that if he told customers clearly, up front about the $2 up charge, half of the customers would decline the add on.  Most customers probably don't even realize the up charge on their bill, or if they do, then Steve just says, ""I said "" ADD"" then the customer feels stupid and Stevo wins!!!!! You better believe when our bill came, I looked it over, not for the blue cheese ADD ON, but for anything scammer like.  If he feels proud and like he's the pro at getting people to buy something they are not aware of, I don't trust him as far as I could throw him.... Moral of the story; a chunk  of blue cheese on your salad is $2 out of the pocket.  Just so you know .",2014-06-14 18:26:16

I never used to be a department store shopper, but recently Ive discovered that nicer cloths just seem to fit better. Go figure. While I still like getting a deal, I usually wait until there is a clearance or sale or some type. The macy's at scottsdale fashion square seems to have more selection, such as more size options for the items you seem to like and a few more items to choose from also. For guys, I would suggest checking out the Dillards at fashion square; the mens dept is about the size of this entire macy's store. 2 or 3 times a year dillards has an awesome clearance event and you can pickup 65% off clearance prices; which are usually already 50 - 70% off the original price.

I digress; this is supposed to be a review of macy's.

ihW0mpuMrkkmeN3TeZ4rog,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,kw8Lh8bJAtquHkT9CB4zGg,4,2,0,1,"Anyone remember when Future Bakery was big business? It had multiple locations around Toronto, and it was focused heavily on the food and culture of its Ukrainian ownership. While the Annex location is still kicking strong and remains a popular beacon for starving U of T students, the others, except for the tiny St. Lawrence Market outlet and a baking factory in the city's Westend, have all but disappeared. All that remains is a lone, ceramic Ukrainian Easter egg sitting high up on a shelf in the Annex location. But time moves on I suppose, and there's a reason that despite the others all going under, the Annex location is still packed at almost all hours of the day.

Future is cheap. Straight up, that's probably one of the predominant reasons they're so busy, but it's not as if you're getting some reheated crappy food for your money. They make some pretty good stuff. (Right off the bat, I'd like to point out that there is a food outlet right in the back of this place, and I think they sublease it to sell food in there, but I am including it in this review, despite that they might be two different places.) Most notably, you can grab a pretty good breakfast there, especially on a Sunday morning. Sundays in the Annex are deadsville; everything is closed until the early-afternoon, so if you live in the area or you happen to find yourself there because you thought everything would be open, this is a great place to grab a pleasant morning breakfast or a greasy hangover cure.

Future has some seriously amazing cakes, and if that's your thing, then you should know that Future is probably one of the best values for cake in the city. Besides having a killer selection of top quality cakes, they all sell for about 5 bucks a cut. There are a whole ton of different kinds too, ranging from fruit pies and caramel-based cakes to cheesecakes and heavy-chocolate tortes. Although I don't find their coffee particularly spectacular, they do have it available, and it's still a pretty natural choice to go with the cake, despite being nothing-more-than-average.

Once the warmer months hit, Future place has got a pretty spectacular patio too.  Busy, big, and perfect for people watching, it's easily the 2nd best patio spot in the Annex. It covers the whole side of Future's corner building, and it's an ideal place for cold pints.

Future pretty much accommodates everyone. Early morning breakfast, late night after the bar, mid-week meeting spot, in-between-classes study hole; no matter what you're using it for, chances are that Future will be able to offer you something.

Think ""Chipotle/Subway-meets-Japanese fusion"" and you'll get the gist of this place.  They have large sushi burritos, bowls and salads, with your choice of different fresh fish (spicy tuna/ yellowtail/salmon/soft shell crab/ etc) or chicken, veggie toppings, and sauces. And it's all prepared when you get up to the counter in assembly-line fashion. Much like Chipotle, some add ons are extra like guacamole or seaweed salad. The sushi rice, for a semi-fast food place is great! And the quality of the fish is pretty great too!  

I had a make-my-own sushi burrito in a soy paper wrapper on sushi rice with spicy tuna + salmon + cucumber + red onion + tomatoes + seaweed salad + chipotle mayo + sweet anguille sauce. IT WAS DELICIOUS. I ate the whole thing in one sitting ( a little big but sushi doesn't keep well).  I got a combo just to try the taro chips with cheesey sauce...meh, I'd skip that next time. 

If you don't want to think too hard, they do have jaburritos already concocted for you with names like Redondo & Long Beach (California dreaming much?). 

My only complaint is that this place is kinda slow....or more so that during lunch time this place gets incredibly packed so get ready to wait in line for a while before getting to order.

I was yelling in excitement as I was saying yeah I have been wanting to try Lee's from hearing about it so much on Yelp! Let's do it!

It was a fun ordering experience at 1am, this place is bright, cute, clean and white! They call out numbers and we did not have to wait long for our sandwiches to go.

I wanted a boba tea however was a bit lost in translation with the sweet gal behind the counter, when I asked what flavors of boba they had it was a game of the first one she says that sounds familiar is what I shall get. She said Lipton, OK that's it, I will take it! Lipton iced tea yeah I know what that is, however not really what I wanted, an iced tea boba but definitely interesting!

We both ordered the BBQ pork sandwiches to go, could not wait to get home and unwrap my bundle of bread. The bread is amazing, chewy, fresh and tasty! The filling was MIA, very little pork and veggies, was really just a baguette. I know they are not expensive however would rather them charge more and actually fill up the bread, that would be yummy. I loved the chili sauce, that is a must otherwise since there is so little filling in the sandwich it would be dry without it!

The staff is always really warm and actually act like they love animals. Some of the other locations, the staff sometimes seems like they'd rather be having dental work.

Today, the sweet girl at the register and I were discussing my rabbit and she was so informative about whether or not I could pre-order in bulk and pointed me to their website in the event they don't have it in stock. Standard knowledge, but I appreciated that she offered it up, like she genuinely cared that I got what I needed.

Finally, at the end of our transaction, she lifts up my bags of hay gingerly, apologizing, but saying she's allergic to most of the hays so she was just being careful. I thought that was so sweet! She never let on the whole time we were talking that she was allergic or potentially uncomfortable. She just smiled and gave great customer service. I hustled the hay out of her vicinity, but she made a point to ask as I left what my bunny's name is. I wish I had made a point to ask hers!

It was my friend's birthday and we wanted to celebrate at dinner nearby and then head back to the hotel with our friends for cake. Unfortunately, the hotel has a very strict policy on the number of people that can be in the room at once. There's a max limit of 4 people and we had way more than that. We tried speaking to the front desk but they wouldn't budge, they said it was because of inevitable noise complaints and fire code restrictions. Understandable.

Other than that, our stay was very pleasant. Access to the elevators is restricted to key card only after 8pm so its safe. The room itself was very clean when we checked in and had no weird smells. It was a large room as well, with a double bed, kitchen (stove, dishwasher, mini fridge) and a bathroom with a stand-in shower. There was also an arm chair in the corner of the room by the windows with a lamp (cute spot to take pics haha). One feature my friend and I enjoyed about this room was the number of mirrors in the room. There was one by the table near the TV, a  large floor length mirror by the door, and the bathroom mirror plus an extra zoom mirror in the bathroom. It made getting ready very easy.

Also another point to note: Plenty of outlets in the room, very handy!",2018-02-05 16:42:35

Armed with a Groupon, and accompanied by another couple, I knew nothing about this bistro except that it served Italian food.  So, I gave it a full gustatory workout to see what it might bring to the table.

We opened with very good fresh Italian bread and Fried Calamari with peperoncini added.  This appetizer came with a mild Marinara Sauce, and my request for Lemon Aioli as an additional dipping choice was graciously accommodated without charge.  As for the Calamari itself, the rings were very good, somewhat better tasting than the tentacles.  Requested butter was quickly provided for the bread.  
 
Italian Wedding Soup was very odd.  It contained spinach leaves as expected, but also cut carrots and a lot of white chicken meat.  I had to send it back, because it wasn't very hot and contained no meatballs as Italian Wedding Soup should.  The restaurant manager and co-owner who was making the rounds of tables agreed; normally included meatballs were missing from my bowl.  When it returned, the small meatballs were the best part, but I didn't like the included tiny tubular pasta noodles that much.

The rest of the dinner soared.  A dinner-size classic Caesar Salad contained firm green leaves of Romaine Lettuce, crunchy croutons, and a good creamy Caesar Dressing.  The portion was generous and took awhile to finish.  The huge portion of Eggplant Parmesan that immediately followed was cheesy, saucy, and quite delicious--magnificent, and the best of its kind I have ever eaten.  My fellow diners were also pleased with their food.  A brick of Meat Lasagna and Veal Alfredo looked particularly appealing.

There was no room or time for any dessert.  We had to dash off to the Cannery to arrive in time to see the last scheduled performance of ""Red Tails"" on its opening night.  I will sample Mezzo Italian Bistro's several dessert offerings on another day.

Seating was comfortable in the cozy bistro, our servers were friendly, and service was good.  Dinner and the movie that followed constituted a fine night out!  A reprise will soon be in order.",2012-02-06 08:39:36

In the past, I've  also stayed at Starwood properties (now a part of Marriot) because they are great. I fly a bit to Toronto and find the Sheraton to be convenient and a Starwood property so I stay there - but I don't enjoy it. There are pros and cons but overall all its the utility that brings me here and that doesn't inspire. 
Pros: Great gym, nice continental breakfast with views if you are a platinum member, very good LG televisions with a great movie selection. The rooms also have outlets on the bedside table - iThe staff is friendly but at times robotic but they seem to mean well. The hotel is huge and for that reason a frequent choice for conferences - so it's often packed and the price per night is reasonable. 

Cons: The hotel is ugly but a durable concrete that will probably withstand an air attack. The rooms are uninspiring even with the 10s of millions of renovations. The bath products (Shine) are terrible. The food options are average. On a recent stay I had the pleasure of electricity going out twice in the bathroom because of a tripped circuit breaker. The wireless is infuriating and spotty and overall terrible in rooms - I was told to go outside in the hallway and hold my phone up to the wireless routers to log on - but you are periodically kicked off.

All of the chains I've been to just don't live up to a good home BBQ'ed meal.  I am pretty sure their motto is ""skimp on the meat because they can't taste it through our 'award winning' BBQ sauce!""  John Mull's puts these chains to shame and lives up to any claims about being as good as home BBQ!

The place itself resides on a small ranch and has that Old Nevada feel to it.  As a native to this state, I love that about the location.  A dirt parking lot and old wooden fences/structures make me feel like I am on a Nevada road trip.  There is a small out door seating area, but I prefer to take my food over to the Tenaya Creek brewery and have a nice IPA with my BBQ... SO GOOD!

So far I have had the brisket, the ribs, a little bit of pulled pork and chicken.  This place has the best brisket I have ever had!  The stuff sits in it's own juices all day, and is incredibly tender and juicy.  ""Wow"" is all I can say about the brisket after hating this cut from other places.  The ribs are fall off the bone delicious.  Just amazing stuff.  Same goes for the pulled pork and chicken, although the pulled pork is a bit on the salty side.  The BBQ sauce has a thick, lightly sweet quality to it.  I prefer the spicy one (it's not that spicy).  But you really don't need BBQ sauce at all.  That is how good the meat is.  The dry rub kicks the crap out of every place I've been to.  All of the sides are amazing as well.  The only thing I am not a big fan of are the desserts, but that doesn't matter to me because the ""dinner"" portions are so huge that you won't have room for dessert anyway.

We went for my husband's birthday tonight and ordered the Mac and cheese, poutine, beef brisket sandwich and ribs.  Overall the food was okay.  I would say that I have had better elsewhere.

Mac and cheese was better than a lot of places due to using a stronger cheese.  My 1 year old son ate it all, so points there!

Poutine had a neat twist to it due to the Smokey gravy.  My husband felt different.  He may be a bit of a purist.

The ribs were fall off the bone and I liked the seasoning but I couldn't help thinking that ribfest had better ones, or Barque.

The brisket would have been better if it wasn't so greasy like other people said.  I think crispy onions would have been a nice touch.  I prefer Leslieville Pumps' brisket sandwich more.

The service was excellent though.  Our server was quick and very accommodating to our son, bringing him colouring sheets and crayons, along with plastic cup for him to drink out of.  She also was able to rush our order for the Mac and cheese, which came just before a hunger meltdown.

- a million tvs ( if you're in to that sort of thing)
- decent selection of bottled beers and a wide range of liquor (which is what I'm in to)

Things that make this place a 3 starer vs a 4 or 5:
- service is suspect at best. They would have gotten a ton more money out of us if they had been on top of the drinking situation. We definitely would have ordered more if the waitress had checked on us more often
- the food is nothing special. Typical bar appetizers and the entrees are just..... Ok. Better tacks have definitely been had and for a better price. Ration of cost and quantity is a bit off.
- The DJ. The kid looked to be 13 and was REALLY hooked on playing the Biebs a little too much and a little too loud.

After moving to town from my native NYC you could say I'm a bit of a pizza snob, but not enough of a snob where I can't/won't admit a good find.

First thing I noticed is that they don't greet you. Maybe if they weren't busy and were waiting for an order they would, but they were moderately busy and there were multiple guys behind the counter. Each and every guy that was behind the counter looked at me at separate intervals, but not once did anybody say ""how you doing, just give us a second here."" I don't need handholding, but  some sort of ""be right with you"" would have been cool.

Guy who took my order was quick and efficient. I ordered and I waited, decent sized order and wait time matched what I ordered, which was fine. They even had it done a bit quicker that I had anticipated. I was taking it to go.

Redeemed the Yelp offer for free garlic knots with a large pizza ordered, which they forgot to give me (the knots lol.) Luckily I said something while still there, and they gladly handled that on the spot. Better to have it happen there than discovering it once I got home.

Ok, now to the food: 

Lg. White Pizza with pepperoni & fresh garlic - very little grease (which is hard to do on a pizza with cheese and pepperoni, so kudos there.) Dough could have been more crisp, but I had read reviews about their crust and knew what to expect. Still really tasty and they don't skimp on the toppings. Nice guys!

Medium Wings - They were ok. I think they would have been better eaten in, not ordered to go. 

Bistro Fries - not bad, just not my cup of tea. Saw pictures on the site/yelp with what looked like stringy cheese. Yeah, there was none of that. One of the reviews raves about them, I wasn't that fond of them. Personal taste, they were fine...I just wouldn't order them again. 

Garlic Knots - tasty, crisp...loved 'em. 

Overall I really like this place! If you come back with your receipt you get half off a pizza within three days...nice touch! I think next time I visit I will order to eat in, I'm confident I will be even more pleased with an order fresh out of the oven. 

Thanks guys! Good stuff! I'll be back!

Tyler: Thanks for your reply, seems altogether a lost art these days. I wasn't blaming you guys for the travel ability of the food, I definitely got the feeling it was travel time induced lol. Still overall a good experience and it will most likely be one of many more.

Thanks again! I appreciate you guys!",2018-01-24 13:09:45

The shrimp po boy (which is a classic southern dish and I'm a classic southerner) was not the over flowing small golden brown shrimp on a soft roll. Instead it was these heavenly breaded large over cooked shrimp on this giant dense roll. I'm a purest so maybe some ppl like this but it's not the traditional sandwich. They also have a ""rueben"" on the menu that was recommended to me by the server. I said I don't care for thousand island/Russian dressing and she stated it didn't come with that...again a classic sandwich without the classic details (and seafood and cheese..no).

The positives are the atmosphere and the salads. My friend got the apple and endive with salmon and raved about it. I'll try this place again but I will come at night when I can try some of their cocktails.

What is great is the layout. In a shape of a figure 8, it allows you to wander the mall systematically AND you could still take a shorter distance to get to where you want to go. As opposed to ONE giant SQUARE that you literally need a map so you don't get lost.

The crowd here, I like. Let me put it this way, I feel comfortable to bring my friends, parents, grandparents, boyfriend, kids here to shop. I feel safe, and in my comfort zone. 

There are higher end stores like Michael Kors and Holt Renfrew and there are middle range ones like Artizia, Abercrombie, bath and body works etc. Then there are the ones that you'll find everywhere like Aldo and Le Chateau. What else is nice are the smaller local boutiques that you've never heard of, like the Treasures Home Decor store (small, but great stuff), and the gourmet Olive Oil store. There was also a Locale shoe store here that I haven't seen else where (or maybe I don't go shopping that much). Victoria's Secret and a Lego (LEGO!!!!) store is opening soon. 

I like that the food court is away from the main mall area and upstairs, but still in a very central area.  The selection is vast, just pick wisely. 

did I mention the plush leather couches that are available for you to sit every few steps. 

I like this mall. Malls should be like this, not some local high school hangout. Maybe this location is why it avoids this.",2011-02-26 06:06:40

I was early on a weekday and there were around 10+ flavours to choose from. I got the HK milk tea, Earl grey, Hojicha, and peach & jasmine. They were all pretty good. To be honest, I find macarons quite sweet in general but I loved how this place had so many flavours including the Asian ones!  There was also the matcha cream puff but I resisted but definitely will try their other treats next time. The macaron packaging did not disappoint.

I had been hearing good things about Piada for years, but the idea of ""an Italian Chipotle"" as it's often described just didn't appeal to me for some reason. I decided to finally give it a try today as I was craving italian food but was short on time.

The ""piada"" is a wrap style sandwich, but you can also choose either salad or pasta bases. They have pre-crafted options but I did a make your own to see what goodies they had available. The choices were beyond my expectations, including sun-dried tomatoes, marinated artichokes, and crispy pancetta rounds. One of the ""protein"" options was calamari - when is the last time you've seen calamari on a fast food menu? Had to try it!

The result was a spinach salad worthy of a fancy restaurant - fresh, high quality ingredients tossed in the perfect amount of a superb, tangy, creamy parmesan dressing. The calamari mixed in was perfectly cooked with a light, flavorful, crispy breading that was addicting.

I was highly impressed by Piada and think we will soon be seeing Piadas pop up across the U.S.! Would love to try a pasta or piada next time, now that I know this place is the real deal.",2015-06-25 23:08:49

the interior of the restaurant is very cute and colourful and the lounge is comfortable to sit in 
never being here before I found out you have to order at the front and grab sauces that you want that I found unique 
I got the medium heat 1/4 chicken and my boyfriend got the lemon and herb one we also got Cajun fries and pop at first 

when it arrived it was what I expected but a little smaller but my boyfriend said it was a very small  portion for what he paid and proceeded to rant oh my . he went to order rice as well. then he came back and said the cashier was rude because he seemed like he was half asleep and didn't know the answers to his questions. 

the food arrived quickly. the rice was very unique different than any other rice I've tasted. it was yellow and had some veggies and a harder texture I would give the rice 3/5 as it was just average 

the Cajun fries were yummy and thick cut. had a nice Cajun spice to it to give it a good flavour 3.5/5 better than average 

the chicken was super good. it surprised me how moist it was and the skin fell off the bone. the sauce and spice was perfect and had a tangy flavour. the lime one was more sour but still had that kick of spice. I find it interesting that they put sauce on a chicken but have lots of sauce at the front. perhaps you should get the plain chicken then you can add whatever sauces you want yourself. overall the chicken is a 4/5 because it is quite expensive for what you get 

overall I would recommend this to people who can handle spice as it gets spicier the more you eat and like chicken. also you can use SPC if you have it but I forgot to use mine

Family owned and operated since 1985 it would be difficult to call Gino Ferraro's family legacy anything less than iconic in Las Vegas, and sustaining three decades in a city where implosion and reconstruction are common both locals and tourists should be happy to know that much like the many fine wines in their cellar Ferraro's Italian Restaurant has only gotten better with time.

Now operating under the toque of Francesco Di Caudo, Gino's son Mimmo involved in the day-to-day operations of two Pizzeria Forte locations on the East side of The Strip, it was at the invitation of the family's patriarch that I sat in the same chair I'd visited during the summer of 2015 and joined by a native Las Vegan Chef and an Italian-American server from New York a carte blanche four-course menu was offered, the sixteen plates ranging from time-honored classics to those just recently launched.

Greeted by Gino at the door and later shown the planned menu to which additions were graciously allowed it was at the suggestion of a longtime Sommelier that wine pairings were offered, a dry Prosecco proving brilliant alongside light opening bites amongst which the shrimp with housemade ricotta and parcels of veal with creamy tuna were elegantly executed standouts.

Talked through each presentation by servers that make the faux-Italian display of hospitality at Carbone seem borderline offensive it was with the taste of tender octopus tossed in briny accoutrements still lingering on the lips that crisp Pinot Grigio made way for the first of two pasta duos, and beginning with a Grinch-green risotto the results of top tier ingredients and careful attention were readily apparent, a sliced sweetbread both supple and rich offering a lovely bridge to the poignant pork flavor imbued in a light broth surrounding hand formed pockets of cheese.

Offered another white along with Gino's famous family lasagna recipe before raising eyebrows skyward to the thrilling presentation of pasta ribbons slicked in spicy spreadable sausage with creamy urchin and  Caciocavallo cheese each adding to form a flavor even more complex than the sum of its parts those fancying bread will no doubt find themselves requesting a second basket for requisite sopping, spotless plates returning to the kitchen without a drop of sauce going untouched. 

Switching to Red with entrees, the first simply not my style while the 2010 Barolo proved to be the best I've tasted of its kind, suffice it to say that there is a reason Ferraro's Osso Buco is ordered at almost every table and although perhaps not *quite* as tender, those desiring something a little less hearty would be well advised to take a look at the braised short ribs over polenta with mushrooms, the best Tripe in Sin City and Meatballs with crisp polenta fries no less compelling.

Still rooted in tradition in the desserts department, many of the offerings predating the restaurant and served with anecdotes about Gino's mother and his children's enjoyment of the cakes and cookies during their youth one would be hard pressed to name one dish ""best"" amongst the trio offered, the chef at our table particularly fond of  Rosalba's  Amaretto and Lemon Cookies while I was particularly taken by the hybrid cheesecake/rice pudding/tres leches reminiscent Pastiera Napoletana with ice cream and orange marmalade, all three of  us also smiling at the forgivingly light Pistachio Passion that tasted as rich as a cannoli with a fraction of the weight.",2016-02-01 19:48:38

Greg came out and had us up and running in no time and saved us a ton of  money compared to Sierra Air who had the lions share of business in our community because they installed throughout the community since it started. Well, at that time,  I knew they were completely price gouging so trusted the fellow yelpers to guide me and they didn't disappoint. This is how I found Greg and Legacy back then . They took care of the problem professionally and reasonably. We had no issues with his work at that time or to this day. My original review was one that was ""highly recommended"" for their business here on Yelp!

I have to say that because of the fine job they did in 2014, I called them first this past week when the AC went out. While I don't want to at this point get into specific details until I can talk with Dave or Greg, I can say I was disappointed this time for a few reasons. I can say however Amanda (office) and her crew are great as I remember. No issue. 

I (we) have a call in to Dave to discuss things that occurred. I believe in supporting smaller family businesses whenever we can! I believe the owner will be open to discuss our concerns and we look forward to talking with him soon over the next few days.

I will update my review after we have had a chance to discuss. Three stars because of office staff. Two because of the other issues we hope to share with the owner . I respect the way he addresses each concern here on Yelp. I want to give him opportunity to discuss the situation first prior to posting anything detrimental that he wouldn't be directly responsible for and people may judge the company prematurely. Everyone deserves an opportunity to make things right.

Update:
Talked with Dave the owner about some concerns and he was receptive and understanding. I can honestly say that this company truly deserves the merits it gets from customers. No one is perfect 100% of the time. But one thing is for sure with Legacy...100% of the time they are dedicated to your satisfaction as a customer.

It's the concept of burrito mixed with Japanese ingredients... And omg it's so good!! 

They have some popular burritos already built with certain ingredients, or you could choose to build your own. Since it's my first time here, I decided to get one of the popular ones.  My boyfriend and I had the Redondo and Rockport.  You can pick your wrapping with seaweed, soy paper, wheat tortilla or flour tortilla.  We both got seaweed since that was the most popular. 

Redondo was really good with salmon, tuna, yellowtail, Masago, jalapeño, Onion, tortilla strips.  They were so good together, the sashimi were so fresh! 

The Rockport had spicy tuna, crab, soft shell crab, jalapeño, onion. 

Both were just super yummy, and we got a side of home made taro chips.  It comes with cheese for dipping, but it totally hides the flavour, it tastes the best with nothing because it is seasoned.

It's a divey joint with limited seating which equates to bang for your buck.  A quick (assuming there is no line) delicious feast between shopping. My favourite part is the potatoes - they fill the bottom of their rotisseries with these carby nuggets and let the juice and fat from the meat drip all over them. Oh soooo dirty. I had the pork ribs with a side of macaroni salad and coleslaw. My friend had the chicken.

They gave us a private room so we can be as loud and disgusting as we wanted to be.  Great service!

Food: We did family style because the night before we ate a Society at Encore and got too stuffed we couldn't get drunk at the clubs haha...
Appetizers..Started with Bone marrow.  Comes with a side of what seems to be beef cheeks or some kind of beef meat that is tender and in small pieces.  Out of this world!  Followed by the roasted beet salad...standard.  Goat cheese and candied walnuts.  Pretty good but not AMAZING...Next was the Mussels and i think this was one of the three dishes that i was not too fond of.  The mussels were small and the wine sauce was bland.  Followed by the Foie Gras. Bomb ass liver!!!  It was thick and the fat was pouring out of my little piece...(it was shared by five girls i could have eaten one complete serving myself!)  Lastly Pate...tasted more like gnawed up meat with a lot of black pepper in it.  Not a fan of this.

Entrees: Handmade Stuffed pasta with escargot and bacon in a mushroom sauce with mushrooms. :) love!  If you are not a fan of snail...dont worry there is no funky texture or even taste.  My friend hates snail and she ate it and loved it.  Next we had the mushroom risotto with truffel flakes!  Need i say more? I licked the plate clean after everyone had their share.  On to the Meats...Hammered Veal...skip.  Didn't like the stringy texture of the meat again it was in ""dog food form"".  It does taste ok flavor wise but texture just threw me.  Last we had the beef cheeks.  Full of flavor and tender with lots of veggies on the side.  Very delicious!

rcCDSREuFzJ8UdSnhqefjw,xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,bBDk37NRCuZndzgDG5j1Tw,3,2,1,3,"Where once we had very limited taqueria options in Montreal, now every neighbourhood seems to have one. No complaints on my end although it is hard to give them all a try. For the occasion of a friend's birthday and just a good Friday Happy Hour, I found myself recently at a taco bar that opened up in Little Burgundy just a short walk from my place, El Gordo Taco Bar.

Started by the same group that owns the neighbouring Geppetto pizzeria, El Gordo is a smallish bar specializing in tacos and other Mexican fare. With the summer weather, they have a nice terrasse out-front off Notre-Dame that increases seating. The space has a nice look to it - Day of the Dead motif and lots of natural lighting through the big windowed facade. Once crowded, the space is pretty loud but the ambience is solid.

Any good bar needs some cocktails and El Gordo satisfied that nicely. Their classic Margherita with agave nectar, fresh lime juice and tequila is nicely balanced. The sweetness of the agave and the fresh lime helped to soften the tequila hit. The Pineapple express with bulleit bourbon, fresh pineapple juice, cilantro and lime was similarly balanced. All the cocktails are available by the pitcher which is a great for a group as we were!

A couple of starters before the tacos. First was the chips and guacamole. The guac was pretty smooth in texture and had lots of lime juice. A little bit of queso fresco on top added a little twist. The plantain empanadas were served with a spicy paste that my girlfriend enjoyed a fair bit. The empanadas had nice crunch to them but they were not that exciting flavour-wise.

El Gordo has 9 standard taco flavours and a special of the day. The standard dish has 3 tacos each and they are pretty small size-wise. For me personally, 3 wasn't enough to satisfy my hunger although the server said as much to me ahead of time. Just be aware of that when you order. My girlfriend ended up regretting not ordered more as she was still hungry later on. The good news is that each taco only comes up to 3-4$ a piece so the price is fair. I tried 3 varieties on this visit. First were the chorizo tacos - served with pickled onions, habareno jam, queso fresco and salsa verde. All the tacos are served on soft tortillas which is my preference. Nothing of that hard shell B.S. The chorizo was nice and tender and the rest of the topping provided a slightly sweet and spicy edge.

The second variety was spicy braised beef brisket with creamy apple and cabbage slaw and pico de gallo. Another hit to us. The smoky brisket was excellent and I really enjoyed the slaw and the hint of sweetness that came from the use of apples. The pico de gallo added some extra freshness.

The final variety was the special of the day and my personal favourite of the night - fried chicken with guacamole, chipotle mayo and creamy coleslaw. I really enjoy the extra crunch provided by the fried chicken. The addition of the guacamole made these tacos feel a little more hearty and the mayo really had a kick to it.

The big negative of the evening was the service. Over the course of the evening, we had two different errors on our order - once our entrees ""disappeared from the computer"" and in the process of re-ordering, our waitress forgot the nachos we had asked for originally. Second time, my friend's order of ceviche was mistook for ""vege"" tacos. Now, we didn't make an issue of the nachos as by the time we figured out she had forgot them, we were ready to move out anyway. However, two errors like that are not really acceptable regardless of how nice the servers were in acknowledging the mistakes.

Good tacos, excellent drinks and a nice decor - El Gordo definitely has a place as a solid happy hour and dinner location. The lack of good happy hour spots around the Market plus the fact that they open at 3pm weekdays and don't take reservations means that El Gordo can certainly fill a nice niche. A few service tweaks and I would be satisfied. I'm just happy I have excellent tacos to enjoy so close by.

I came here with one other friend for dinner around 6pm on a Tuesday evening. We know that Fresh can get busy and does not take reservations, so we decided to come earlier as opposed to later. When we arrived the restaurant was about 80% occupied and there were still a number of tables available. Despite this, the hostess said it would be a few minutes wait and she took our names. We were a bit confused because there were clearly empty tables available for parties of two. Nevertheless we were seated about a minute later.

This restaurant is jam packed. Don't come expecting any privacy at all. Our table was literally no more than four inches apart from the gentleman dining beside us. Every time I come to this location without fail someone at the table beside me (or myself) knocks something off of a neighbouring table when entering or exiting their seat.

Our server was pleasant and described the soups of the day for us and explained that they were out of the special of the day. I appreciated the she ensured we always had enough water at our table because I can find that they sometimes forget to do this at Fresh.

My friend and I both ordered our go to dishes. The macro greens on steamed greens (no sprouts, extra sweet potato) with chickpeas on the side for me and the baby beach bowel on rice with a side of corn bread and hummus for my friend. These dishes were both received as expected and we were pleased. I also asked  for their hot sauce because I love spicy food. Usually I love the hot sauce at Fresh, but this time it was a bit disappointing. It was not as spicy as usual and I had to cover my dish in it to get any sort of kick.

She's a veteran LC shopper, so she knew to go on Tuesdays when they put the new merch out supposedly.

We got there about 11:00 am or so and it wasn't too bad, like some of the crowd pics on Yelp- oh my!

I did get a ""wake -up"" call when one of the ""guards"" started shouting at shoppers to ""stand back"" and ""line up"". While they restock, they close down that section and make people line up and then re-admit them. Or they ""re-open"" and shout: ""This section of ladies tops is now 50% off the marked price.. please stay in the line for entry"" It gave it a dystopian Soylent-Green kind of atmosphere. Kinda fun, but a little scary.

I didn't quite understand the inner workings, but it seems like 90% of the shoppers here are regulars, so they just know what to do. Some of them are like vipers- eyeing the merchandise then pouncing, others rifle through the purse tables like lunatics looking for that bargain of the century, and lots of people literally pile their shopping carts 4 feet high-- just don't get in their way!

The store is much smaller than you'd think, but its crammed full o' stuff including mens, womens, housewares, accessories, purses, shoes and sunglasses. Some of the merch is in sad shape, and one thing I did not like was the fact they write the price IN MARKER on the inside of the leather goods. Would you pay 488.00 for a purse that has ""488.00"" written in the interior in marker? The shoes, in particular, all looked worn to me, although they say the merchandise is brand new it was hard to believe looking at the worn out soles and insides. That being said, many of the ladies who shop here are stylish indeed, and look quite moneyed. Rich stay rich by shopping here perhaps?

I would have spent much more time in here, and I really think you need a minimum of 2 hours to do it right, but my 11 year old son was having a major caniption fit asking me every 2 minutes ""when are we leaving?"" at my elbow. Not the optimum scenario for hard-core bargain hunting.

We got the mapo tofu, pork fried rice, jajangmyeon, and the fried dumplings. Mopo tofu was disappointing. Mapo tofu is known for that numbing spiciness. It didn't have any sign of that. Meh. 

The jajangmyeon was the best of what we ordered and it was the cheapest thing we ordered. It is a bit on the sweeter side. But it was weirdly inconsistent. My friend got the same thing and his sauce was thick while mine ended up watery. I'm not sure if its just because I eat slower or not. 

Fried rice was supposed to have pork in it but somehow there was no pork? I'm not really sure what happened to that dish there. 

Fried dumplings were yummy so I can't really complain about these. I don't think you can really go wrong with those anyways. However, dumplings cost more than the noodles. I don't really quite understand that.

So we got there early for our reservation, but were seated anyway...good point. We were sat at a high top table....but our menus and the wine list were too big to fit on the table, making for awkward shuffling of menus, trying not to knock anything off of the high top table...not the best planning on their part. The place is very loud, as the decor is kind if industrial and all of the sounds bounce around a lot. I got a glass of the riesling and it was very good. The bread they brought out was good, I liked that it was warm and toasted, I wish the oil had more vinegar in it, but it was tasty all the same.  I ordered the short ribs and the BF got the capellini. The capellini was actually very good....the sauce had a very robust flavor, even a little spicy and the portion was big. The short ribs were kind of meh. I thought the flavor was fine, but they could be cooked longer. There was a ton of fat still on the ribs (usually it has largely melted away by the time they are served) and although I did NOT have to use a knife, I had to work very hard with my fork to eat them....which should never be the case with braised short rib. The gnocchi that came with the rib, however, was very good.... it was a stuffed gnocchi, which I have never had before. We ordered the tiramisu for dessert and thought that the tiramisu itself was good, very light and airy, but with a lot of espresso flavor, but they plated it with very pretty lines of strawberry sauce and chocolate. The strawberry sauce had a strange flavor....not good, and the bites with it (which were many of them) had a strange flavor from the sauce, I saw the pic on here with the tiramisu in a bowl and the sauces on the side....that would have been the perfect presentation so we could opt out of the strawberry.

I have been to this place so much because I have tried to like it and to be open-minded. Their durian smoothie, avocado smoothie, and iced coffee all taste really delicious. 

Their sandwiches, however, are horrible. There is not enough filling. When I paid extra for the patê, I never received it. I went back and asked for it and they literally opened the sandwich and showed me the smear of patê that was vaguely there. Their bread is really hard. I have seen them bake the bread with the dough, but I have also seen them take fully cooked baguettes out of boxes twice that I have been there.

For a while, I was addicted to their coffee and would return. It's pretty neat that they have a line just for coffee, however, they do not really sell coffee. It is more like ice that they sell. If you get their coffee without ice, it is like an espresso shot in a really big cup. 

Also, after they seemed to have figured out that their competition was Mr. Sandwiches, they decided to come out with a banner that said, ""Buy 5 sandwiches, get 1 free. Buy 2 coffees, get 1 free."" Nevermind that coffee is a non-countable noun, but their ad shows that they are trying to compete with one of the already better-than-them places. 

I also kept going back because they have free wi-fi (password is ""springmountain""). I would say that is a big plus, although when they first advertised it, I was really excited, only to find that they have a lack of electric outlets for any computers, which is not normal for a place that advertises free wi-fi. 

I haven't been back in a long time, because I really enjoy softer bread with more filling, over at Mr. Sandwiches. I haven't rated them yet, but will do so soon after I try a couple more things.

My 8 year old loves hibachi (can you say onion volcano) so off to the back we went.  I was very impressed with the friendly service and the willingness to accommodate (they made a deep fried California roll on request and answered all our questions.)  I especially like that they let you pick your combinations so you aren't stuck with something you don't like just to get the steak or lobster.  You pay a basic 8.95 for salad, soup and the table seat and then you choose your entrees ala carte ranging from 4.95 for chicken to 12.95 for lobster.  (prices may vary).  They also have a kids menu with large portions.  

The show is the same you get at any hibachi place with our excellent chef making a rice heart, an egg roll, an onion train, fireworks and volcano.  I was impressed that the chef gave us all a shrimp toss and all but one of us who tried, caught it. (My daughter was too shy to try).

The quality was good and the chef cooked the steak perfectly. We opted for the fried noodles instead of the rice and they were excellent.  The rice looked good too.

Even the ginger dressed salad and the onion soup were very good.

The sushi roll was a little on the skimpy side but tasted very good.

We dropped by around 4:30 on a weekday and it was fairly empty which is nice because you're not forced to sit beside strangers in tight quarters. We both ordered Islamic noodles with 10 chilies and were served fairly quickly. For the price, the food portions are quite large and arrived hot to the table. 

Based on my experience, I believe the chilly system is flawed because different menu items are affected differently by the chilies. For example, the first time I went to Salad King, I ordered the Islamic noodles with 10 chilies. It was spicy but I enjoyed it. Another time I ordered the Golden Curry with 10 chilies because I knew I could handle it based on the Islamic noodles. Unfortunately, the curry was waay too spicy and I regretted my decision instantly.

Those with prior Thai experience will see most of the standards on the menu here: plenty of noodle and rice dishes, served with your choice of protein, or curried dishes to pack in a bit of spice.  House specialities are familiar, but well-executed (particularly the whole fish and duck).  

Largely Americanized, the dishes can be made spicier upon request.  Saying nothing usually results in a rather mild dish.  Also, as everyone tends to do their ""standards"" just a bit differently, your experience with your ""go-to"" favorites will vary here.  I, for example, do not care for their take on Pad Thai: lacking in peanut flavor and a bit too ""sweet"" for what I have come to like in that dish.  Your mileage will vary, so just keep that in mind.

Drinks are a bit on the pricy side here, and I bemoan the loss of half price wine night on Sundays (it's now 1/3 off), but this is uptown and the price point is on-par with the higher-end neighbors.  A couple of interesting cocktails on the menu will get things started for those just looking to bar-hop.

Do use the ""free"" valet parking here, as otherwise you're pressing your luck for a space on the street or paying a hefty fee to use one of the not-so-close decks.  Given then steep hill the front door is on, it's better to let the pros do it, IMHO.  But, once you're done you are in the middle of the ""uptown"" action: very easy to get around to some of the other hot spots in this area.  In all, this is a welcome presence in uptown for the diversity of cuisine in an upscale setting.",2013-12-30 21:34:11

Honey Salt is tucked away in the corner of the shopping plaza on the corner of Rampart and Charleston, as the hidden gem in the corner of the plaza. With so many different reviews of the fried chicken sandwich, I definitely had to try it as well. It is described as the Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken sandwich on the menu and comes with a creamy slaww, house durkees dressing on a nicely toasted brioche roll. It comes with a lightly dressed chopped salad. Two perfectly fried pieces of chicken - what is not to like about that...besides wanting a larger portion or more of it (but that would just be gluttonous). The portion size is just right.

I read that they are small, sweet peppers so I decided to go with it. Oh my goodness were they delicious! They were grilled and seasoned with miso salt. They had came with radish slices, cilantro, and lime wedges. Around the end of the plate was a spicy sauce that sort of tasted like spicy mayo. I can't get over how good they were!

In an effort to find something to do and stay out of the heat, we decided to check for local shows that our 4yo and 6yo might be interested in seeing. I had driven by the Herberger during trips downtown for work conferences and noticed that Mary Poppins was coming up. Well, this past weekend was showing Annie instead (MP to come next week!). Our kids knew one of the songs from Annie because my son takes theatre classes in Scottsdale and figured they might connect with the younger cast.

We booked balcony seats, front row. We loved seeing the orchestra play-- which is so cool-- live orchestra in front of the stage just like on Broadway! The only downside was that the music almost overpowered the singing/talking. It was, at times, difficult to hear. I'm not sure if it's because we were high up, above the orchestra or because we were just far away-- or maybe their mics were turned lower. Either way, I wanted it tad louder.

So of course, my expectations of the event has become elevated and I would expect no less than this marvelous display.

I initially went on Saturday because it was a nice day to go for a walk, and as I approached the distillery district, rows upon rows of cars could be seen stuck on the roads. I guess these must be the people that are trying to get in, or perhaps get out.

Getting to the event area itself, I could see nothing but throngs of people everywhere. Hundreds of people crowded around each exhibit, with lines going way past where they should be. Grabbing an event map, it looks like there were only 21 exhibits scattered around the district. I guess having 100 people assigned to each exhibit sort of makes sense.

Moving around was a challenge.
Seeing an exhibit was quite difficult.
Trying to take a picture? Good luck.

You could hear a lot of people commenting on what a waste of time this is and how nothing good ever comes from this place. Well, I wouldn't be surprised: it's like waiting for an attraction at wonderland during the weekend, but then when your turn finally comes up you realize it's done in half a minute.

I came back on a Tuesday evening. Weather was a bit colder, and it had rained earlier, but there was barely anyone there. 100 people max, and most of them were probably there for the pubs or some board of directors meeting at the Young Theater of Performing Arts.

This time, I actually had the opportunity to see what these exhibits were about and to take some pictures without a hundred people in the background, or having to wait half an hour to get a glance in. And they weren't too bad actually.

However, it was definitely nothing like the teaser pic that blog TO showed. Reading over the article again, there was a small disclaimer at the very end of the article that said the picture was actually taken from another light festival in a completely different country on the other side of the world.

They could have served it with a roll 1/2 the size and eased up on the amount of the apricots, which totally masked the flavor.  I also had the fries, which were very good, and the blue cheese bacon dipping sauce that had no flavor at all and looked like milk more than a dipping sauce.

440 W. Warner Road, Tempe, 85284

Our group arrived at 6:00 and was promptly seated. This is a relatively small restaurant and they had three large groups all at the same time, which made service a tad slow.  Drink orders were taken, and I had a wonderful cup of hot green tea (possibly Genmai Cha) which had a nutty flavor to it. Over the course of the meal I think I drank at least 4 cups of it, it was so good.

For the starter, I ordered the Baked Green Mussels - Very nicely made - not smothered in sauce like some places do. We were off to a good start.

Next I tried some of the sushi. Because it was Eel Day in Japan I ordered Unagi (freshwater eel). It was nicely presented with the proper sauce on top and still nice and warm. Next was Tako (octopus). It was cut nice and thin so that it was not chewy at all and had nice flavor. I ordered Tamago (egg omelet sushi) and Inari (Tofu pouches filled with sweet rice), but never got to taste them because a number of my companions grabbed them before I could! They loved them.

Because happy hour was not over until 6:30 and we arrived at 6:00, I ordered a California Roll and a Crunch Spicy Tuna Roll at a reduced price. Both rolls were nicely made and of a good size. Special kudo's for the crunch roll which was extra delicious and had wonderful flavor.

Finally, I got to the Izakaya Menu. In Japan, Izakaya shops are known for small plates usually served with good cold beer. Most often they serve Yakitori which are individual small pieces of chicken on skewers, grilled over special charcoal and coated with a flavorful glaze. 

The waitress brought out a large assortment of them for me. The Sunagimo (chicken gizzard) was nicely chewy, and the Hatsu (chicken hearts) melted in my mouth. The Negima (chicken breast with green onion) which is very popular in Japan was excellent and the Tori Momo (chicken thigh) was delicious. The Teba (chicken wings) were nicely cooked and had just a touch of spice to them and the Tori Kawa (chicken skin) was so good it brought tears to my eyes. At every bite I was reminded of eating in Japan because the food was so authentic.

Lastly, I had Tako Yaki (Octopus flour balls), a favorite street food in Japan. They were nicely made with a hardened outer shell, a type of bread filling, and a piece of octopus in the center. It had some Japanese mayonnaise over the top along with some bonito flakes. It was so good.

My ending bite was Saba (seasoned raw mackerel sushi) which was some of the best I have ever had.

Companions (6 of them) had some wonderful super light tempura, as well as a Curry Katsu (pork cutlet curry) and a Katsu Don (Panko breaded pork cutlet over rice with egg and sweet onions).

The restaurant was nice and clean, and while service could have been better, one has to take into account that they were trying to handle 3 large groups at one time.

4 stars for outstanding food, cleanliness, and trying their best to serve three large groups in a small restaurant. I will definitely be coming back to eat here again and again.",2015-07-19 04:16:07

We decided on Kwality Sweets as they are very familiar with this place. I really enjoyed having all of the dishes on the menu explained to my by my extended family, I defer to them as they are the experts on this type of cuisine ;)

I ordered paneer pakora as my starter. The best way to describe this is like deep fried mild cheese, served with a spicy sweet sauce. This is one of my very favourite Indian fast foods, I just love it and could eat this all of the time!

We also enjoyed gol cuppe, which are little fried puffs that you stuff with a mixture of chick peas and potatoes, dunk into very spicy water, then pop into your mouth for a flavour explosion! So so so yummy!!!

We ordered a tandoor mixed grill for the table with Afghan and Haralyi chicken, and a goat kabob. The meats were super flavourful and tender.

For my main I selected a thali, which is a platter of veggie dishes that you select yourself which comes with rice, salad, dhai (yogurt) and a sweet of your choosing. I chose the aloo gobi (potato cauliflower curry), mutter paneer (cheese and peas in gravy), and the galab jamun (round little sweet ball). It was all very tasty and fresh, I just loved it!

My BF ordered an amazing dosa, which comes with various dips, including an amazing coconut chutney - very tasty! I liked how you can actually watch the dosa chef making the dishes in the restaurant, lots of talent that man had!

To wash it all down, I ordered a special Indian coffee which my BF's mom recommended (not sure of the name but try to order it when you are here - so good!).

The drink is sweet with lots of blueberry taste. Not only was the drink amazing, but the service was too. I was confused on the difference between Milk tea and fresh milk tea and the cashier was so friendly and sincere she explained everything to me.

When she gave me my change, she placed it in a little wooden tray, like in Japan -- how cute! I appreciate the tray instead of dumping change into my hands, gives me time to organize my change ^^

Most of food was very good overall.  They do have some flaws.  The service was good but needs improvement.  The server was a friendly but seemed little too eager to push certain items.  First the server greeted us with a bottle of wine they wanted to sell at $29 a bottle which we did get.  She mentioned the specials but did not give any prices for the items.

One in our party had the lobster special which was very good.  Another had the prime rib which was good but nothing special.  It did not have much flavor.  Two others in our party had the rack of lamb which ended up being $45.00 each which was not mentioned by the server.  We should have asked.  There did not seem to be very much on the plate and had this sweet sauce of the lamb.

The table that we had was very cramped for four people and were stuck under a hot heating vent.   The server did spill the wine twice.  Also when grating the cheese she got it all over the place including my pants.

Overall I think the meal could have been a little better for what they are charging.  We got there right at opening and by the time we left there was a line out the door.  It was a Saturday.  If you do decide to go here stick with the printed menu items.",2015-10-18 11:21:22

This location is near downtown Tempe/mill. If you come here on the weekend, apparently the Parking Garage next door is free. Good thing to know if you're looking for a parking spot.

Pretty nice area and location.
We had a group of 10, divide the group into 5 and 5 for seating, as It was a faster waiting time. It did take at least 50 minutes to an hour of waiting, and this was around 12pm. 

Luckily we were seated into booth next to each other, even though it was back-to-back.
Server and waitress were all friendly and pretty attentive.

For food, I had the snooze breakfast burrito. The burrito had hash brown, beans, eggs, and I decided to add in the chicken meat, which cost additional $1 or something I believe. Everything was topped off with tomatoes and their green chili sauce.
What I didn't like about the burrito, was there was way too much hash brown in the burrito, which does fill you up, but I wish there was something else inside the burrito.
Definitely wanted more chicken in the burrito, but maybe a few bites had a little bit more chicken.

Burrito overall was just okay, nothing special. Also the burrito was a little dry. I had to use their table green chili sauce for additional sauciness. And ketchup for the hash brown, wish I dissected it out. 

But if you're hungry, the burrito will feel you up for sure. I only finished just a little over half of the burrito.

Pricing was around $13. 

They do have inside and outside restroom.

Also when you are waiting, there is a person on the patio making mimosa and drinks for you while you wait. which is a nice touch. There is also a ping pong table outside.

---
I was able to try one of their pancakes as well. Not sure what type of pancake it was. But the pancake had a cinnamon / some caramel / mostly butterscotch syrup on the pancake. With a brown sugar butter cream on top. The pancake was actually pretty delicious. Would probably recommend having their sweet or pancakes, as opposed to the burrito for sure. 

Also it is ridiculous that a single pancake cost $4.75. 

Would I come back to snooze?
If there wasn't a wait, maybe. But I will probably check out other breakfast/brunch places first before coming back to snooze. Their pancake was good though.",2018-03-26 07:06:18

Made a reservation for my husband and I along with another couple for a Sunday night.  We were on time and the place was pretty deserted (which was nice).  We were seated immediately at a hibachi table and our drink order was taken.  

I opted for the chicken dinner and my husband went with the filet mignon.  Fair warning:  it's A LOT of food.  They start with a flavorful beef based broth-type soup with mushrooms, fried onions and scallions.  Next is a small salad with a light, tangy vinaigrette (I suppose) dressing.  It was a nice accompaniment to the soup.  The chef then started his show on the grill and it did not disappoint.  He made fried rice (you pay extra for that at Benihana, by the way) and grilled mushrooms, onions, zucchini and bean sprouts.  I don't know what that pink special sauce is but they need to bottle and sell it!  It gives everything an amazing flavor and, um, hello?  It's pink!!!  My husband is allergic to shrimp so he did our entrees next and then the shrimp last. The chicken and meat were cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.  

The food was excellent.  There's just something about watching food being cooked right in front of you that makes it taste better.  Am I right?  Like I said, they give you lots of it - I had to give about half of mine to my husband to finish.  The chef was wonderful - he did all the standard tricks and had a fun personality to boot.  The service was excellent - our drinks were refilled without having to ask and we were doted upon the entire time (the benefits of an empty dining room, I suppose?).

The restaurant itself is clean and updated from the last time I had been there (years and years and years ago).  They've separated the hibachi tables from the sushi bar so there's a nice distinction between the 2 dining areas.  The hibachi booths are comfy and roomy and the bathrooms are clean (always a non-negotiable in my opinion).

The only drawback that I saw was the potential for a long wait time should we not have had a reservation.  There was only one chef that night and it was pretty slow in there but if a walk in party had arrived, I imagine they would have had to wait for the chef to finish with us and that would have made for a long wait time.  My suggestion?  Make a reservation if at all possible.

I honestly feel like this place blows Benihana out of the water.  The food was better, the service more attentive and I kid you not, our total bill at Geisha House was HALF of what it was at Benihana.

There are an astounding number of flavors you can add to your beverage, from almond to salted plum (umeboshi flavor...not sure how I feel about that).  They have a limited number of fresh fruit smoothies per day.  Many of their beverages are choice of tea+1-2 flavors for free+either tapioca pearls or jellies. They have a ""base"" of different mixtures, like a black, green, thai tea, chai, mix ready to go for making drinks. If you wish for some sort of crazy combination like a certain type of tea + flavoring and milk, they will do that too.  They'll also heat seal their cold beverages so it doesn't spill when you are carrying your drink. 

As for things other than tea, the Steepery has cupcakes, cake pops, and macarons from Cupcakes A Go Go.

My only caveat is that I find the sweet beverages almost too sweet.  I'll have to ask staff if the prepared tea mix is sweetened; maybe it can be less sweet if they maek the tea from scratch then just add the flavoring.

They also always have some delicious sweet treats from sweets from the earth. Make sure you save some room for dessert.

Coquette is unique in that it's intensely beautiful and contains some refreshing wittiness (most likely inspired by Shane Culey, Owner and Cheerman of the Bored) to break up the stark class of a typical French patisserie. It has less of the classic, fine French patisserie style and more of a rugged French patisserie style. Which is nice, actually.

They also excel in food quality. The Maple Bourbon macaron was easily the second-best macaron I've ever placed on my tongue. The texture was perfect which would make it worth it with no flavor at all; but the maple and bourbon taste combination made it more than divine. 

They have some drinks too. I guess. I'm only assuming that the bottles and the menu weren't only decorations. I have a macaron eating habit, but not a wine drinking habit so I didn't try any.

The value here is exceptional and the dining space is actually comfortable and clean.

Surrounded by other larger and brighter restaurants in Market Square, I'm not sure we would have stopped in on our own but glad we did.

The first day we went we sat downstairs at the bar where we watched the food being prepared.  It was fun to interact with the cooks and staff as we waited for our meals.  We ordered the mojo fries, OG mac and cheese and a couple burgers to split.  The mac was outstanding.  The pasta was perfectly cooked.  The fries were fresh, well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  

I ordered the ""I don't care whatever"" burger.  I had a slight misunderstanding with the waitress about how I wanted it cooked but she quickly resolved the issue and the cooks quickly made me a new burger.  All I can say is it's one of the best burgers I have ever had.  The meat was fresh and cooked perferctly.  The toppings we're diced small which lends to the eating experience; I got a mix of everything in each bite.  The had a good selection of craft beers.  

After dinner we went upstairs and ordered a drink at the bar.  I wouldn't exactly call it a full bar but they do have a great selection of burbons and scotch.  They seem to specialize in Manhattens and Old Fashioneds.  I ordered Blanton's burbon on the rocks.  The bartender realized he didn't have enough so rather than giving me a weak pour, he gave me Four Roses Single Barrel at the lower Blanton's price!  Great customer service.

We loved this place so much we went back two nights later this time sitting upstairs.  We ordered the beer cheese fries which were great.  The beer cheese wasn't overly cheesey, it had a slight gravy flavor.  We also ordered the blue cheese and garlic mac and cheese.  If I were to be super picky this is where I would have my only complaint.  I expected more fresh garlic and the blue cheese they use is very mild and didn't really stand out from the regular cheese sauce.  I'm not sure it was worth the extra 5 or 6 dollars over the regular mac and cheese.  That being said it was still quality and tasted great.  I ordered the same burger I had before.

I don't give 5 stars easily but this place deserves it.  Anything this place lacks in size and space it more than makes up for in armosphere, food and customer service.",2015-08-11 13:48:25

After flunking out at McFadden's, me and a group of friends decided to try our luck at Miller's. We walked in at about 11:30PM on a Friday night. Lucky for us, the Happy Hour had started at 10PM. The place was decently full and since we couldn't find any seating at the bar, we grabbed a table. The server came right up and took our drink orders.

Holy moly! The drinks during happy hour are super cheap! For $2, you can get a 16oz. Bud or Bud Light. For one more dollar, you can upgrade to a hefty 23oz. Happy Hour Appetizers were $5. There were drink specials like a $3 Martini and other ridiculously cheap drinks. Those prices alone make me a fan of Miller's Alehouse. Being a lightweight and all, I could get smashed for around $10. ;)

Miller's Alehouse is a sports bar with a rustic edge to it. The vibe at Miller's felt upbeat and sociable (a refreshing change).  The server kept the drinks coming. I think we just found our new hangout spot for drinks at Town Square! Next time, I'm planning on trying one of their appetizers....

Their cocktail list mirrors their menu, replete with classic cocktails, many stiff, but plenty not.

Desserts here might trump appetizers.  Checkout the chalkboard overhead and make sure you save room.  They change often, but the homemade ice creams are awesome.  You never know which flavor they'll have, but you almost can't go wrong with all the flavors they put out.  Plus, they once had a cookie ice cream sandwich that was to die for.

The food is so-so -- not as good as Wildflower, but slightly better than Paradise Bakery. I had their panini and soup combo. The panini was fine and for the soup I had chicken tortilla, which I must say was pretty tasty. Their bakery selections, however, did look delicious! And they do catering, which might be nice if your having a small gathering or a work meeting.

The staff seemed very friendly and helpful. I was greeted by a ""hostess"" when I entered and then directed by another ""hostess"" to an open ordering station. The dinning area is pretty large, with plenty of places to sit as well as a good sized patio.

The food is usually good, but we've had experiences of getting sick after we eat there as well: That may be because we already have tricky tummies, and not necessarily because of the food itself.  The waiters and waitresses are usually good, but can become overwhelmed. 

This is a place where what you find usually depends on --when-- you go. You go on say... Easter? Expect chaos. You go mid-week lunch hour? Much better.

Another thing Yelp reviewers must admit --- the cleanliness of the dining area, and sometimes the buffet often depends a lot on the attentiveness of parents and their willingness to supervise and accompany their children as they should. Emphasize the word ""Supervise"". I've seen big family parties where the adults are so busy laughing and gorging themselves that the kids are running wild. That said, the employees and managers have a duty to say something to the parents. But........ in the way the world is today, that might be construed as racist or prejudice in some manner.

Depending on how you get in your opinion may differ; my suggestion is to monorail it and walks on in.  For locals Hmm pretty much out of luck unless you know someone who knows someone!  I got lucky with my rental placement at the time and so did my friends :) 

One of the things I noticed for the both big conventions is the monorail is a huge asset and convenience for locals who don't mind planning ahead and getting a local monorail pass at a seriously discounted price (conveniently placed at any stop or load point along the way if you look for it) and parking down the road or for travelers to get to and from.  The off loading point for this stop It is situated in-between the north and south halls makes it easy to roam.

This place looks large from the outside but when you get inside it is even bigger, (are sure you wear your comfy shoes) there is food/drink Kiosks inside during the large shows they also had them outside.  I believe that is an on demand thing though; the smaller shows make sure you have drink and a snack or 2 to be safe.

As many reviewers have already stated, you need to go in here with realistic expectations. It's just ice cream. Despite the elaborate preparation, which is fun to observe, the taste is pretty basic and identical to your standard, run-of-the-mill ice cream.

We opted for the Decaffeinator and Thai Sensation. The Thai Sensation consists of thai tea flavored ice cream with some lychee mixed in. The Decaffeinator is coffee flavored with oreos added. You are then free to add two toppings or more at an additional cost, similar to what people do with frozen yogurt. Both were fine for what they are, but as I said, it's really just ice cream - so don't expect to find a different texture (a la snoh).

Server was very polite and price is pretty much typical of what most other places charge for rolls - which might be off-putting for some. We've visited a few other places where I've enjoyed the rolls a bit more, but I think this is attributed to them offering more desirable combinations.

I think everyone should sample it for the novelty at least once, but I'm not sure if the trend will stick for very long.

Great banh khot (mini luna pancakes with shrimp) and above average bun cha gio thit nuong (cold vermicelli rice noodles with egg rolls, grilled beef), and nuoc cham (sweet fish sauce). Price is pretty steep (I think it was about $5 for 2 spring rolls), but it sure beats driving 4 hours to Brodard so I'll take it!!)

I think I can speak on behalf of a lot of my foodie friends, when I say - OMG! They have Brodard here now! With the crack sauce and errrrythang!

Sitting pretty in the heart of China Town, right next door to Beauty to Beauty Salon and in the same strip mall as Joyful House Chinese restaurant, you'll see a large Grand Opening/ Vietnamese French Cuisine banner for them (they don't have their official signage yet).

Alright, so you might be wondering why am I so freaking excited that this restaurant is in town...We just moved here from Southern California and Brodard in Garden Grove was the dominating force in (Vietnamese) spring rolls. Their (crack) sauce is the most talked about sauce in Orange County! (I eat it like soup, it's that good...) Turns out that Nem Nuong Bistro gets shipped the real deal nem nuong (pork patties) and (crack) sauce from Brodard weekly! What a relief! 

One of the brothers from the wildly popular Brodard in Garden Grove owns Nem Nuong Bistro. So the rumors are true, they're offering up the same spring rolls as Brodard in CA! Well, almost the same -- They put more of the crispy fried eggroll wrapper in their rolls and a little less nem nuong meat compared to Brodard (to cut costs?), but you really can't tell the difference. It's still bomb as fuuuuuh. The sauce is exactly the same! Rocked my face off! Damn good. 

The rest of the dishes are still being ironed out and are not identical to Brodard, but that's more than ok with me - I thought they did a great job and my compliments to the chef! 

We also tried their banh khot appetizer (mini luna pancakes with shrimp lettuce wraps.) The luna cakes were crispy on the bottom and had great turmeric flavor. They were extremely addicting. 

We shared the bun cha gio thit nuong (cold vermicelli noodles topped with grilled beef, egg rolls, veggies, peanuts, and served with nuoc cham (sweet fish sauce). It's the perfect summer dish for Nevada's scorching hot weather! I'm typically very picky with this dish since I'm Vietnamese and cook it all the time, but I found their version to be delicious, refreshing, and I scarfed it down. They gave plentiful moist grilled beef, though the egg rolls were heavy on the wrapper, it was still better than most. They also gave a heaping amount of noodles - there was an excess of noodles at the end. 

The restaurant is new, clean, with modern asian decor. They have only been open for 5 weeks and they are already running out of those spring rolls! When we ate here, they were down to their last rolls, so we were limited on how many rolls we could order - we were only able to snag 2 rolls total. (Yup, they are that sought out!) 

Also, amazing service from start to finish! Our server Lam is a great guy! Very respectful, friendly, efficient and all around stand-up guy. Felt like we knew him for years!

Just an FYI - Parking sucks, not the restaurant's fault but it's very limited.

For starters, I asked for a water to drink. The waitress brings out what looks like water, but after the first sip (which I almost spit back into the cup because it grossed me out) I realized it was an infused water. I remembered another yelper posting a pic of their water which was very obvious that it had pieces of watermelon in it to show that it was infused.  Mine tasted more like it was infused with only the skin part of the watermelon. Gross. You've been warned.

The cucumber appetizer had a nice sesame based sauce to it with a very light drizzle of chili oil, but the way they have it stacked - the bottom pieces didn't have any flavor at all. It would have been better if the cucumbers were at least lightly pickled or marinated. Very bland.

Beef pancakes were good, they took 15min to make (and they did tell us) but came out nice and hot. They are very very juicy - seasoned just right. Dough is a little thick but this is typical. 

Beef shank - soup base was very bland.  It was a very light white colored broth. It was literally 5 pieces of beef shank, some noodles and a pile of green onions.

Beef brisket - (I stole some of my wife's soup since mine was so boring) soup base was much better, had a darker red color with a little kick to it. But still dressed up with only some green onions.

I'll tell you where the was place really good, and that's their hand shaved noodles - the texture of the noodles with the intentional imperfect cuts was really great. It's just a shame that I had to use 3 spoonfuls of hot sauce to give my soup some flavor.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again.",2017-10-16 06:05:24

But here is my question, why are all of the staff beautiful young boys?! I have only seen one girl ever behind the counter at Capriotti's. The rest are these cute young things with a knack for making great subs, and girls sweat while they wait! I am in love and completely happy, but I am always begging my boy to go to Capriotti's. I think he is starting to catch on, but I don't care. Girls, Capriotti's has awesome sandwiches, and awesome eye candy while you wait...what could be better for lunch?

It's a 5 I say! A FIVE. We stopped in for a bite before heading to BotaBota and it was all because I had a fish & chips craving from earlier in the week that had yet to be satisfied. My poor victim of a guest is NOT a fish and chips person whatsoever and told me as we were waiting that they had literally never had an enjoyable fish and chips meal.

We grabbed a seat on the terrace and took advantage of the $18.50 for a full fish & chips + a pinte. We ordered the Salmon (stout batter) and the Cod (beer batter). The service was relatively quick and efficient in ensuring we were enjoying our meal. OH BOY WERE WE. We split the two dishes so we could taste some of both. The Cod plate was honestly what most higher end restaurants would aim for if they had fish on their menu. Very moist, thicker but light batter, and of course, perfection in the form of potatoes. Every bite was perfect in taste and texture. There was no excess oil, burnt corners or the usual slew of crap in the batter or frozen fish to be seen. This was the real deal. Then to make the meal even better, I had my first bite of the Salmon. The fish itself was perfectly moist, flavorful and wrapped delicately in a thinner layer of a thicker (stout beer) batter. It was too good. Literally, now I'm mad I haven't been going since its farther from home.

Honestly, that Salmon Stout dish... The Keg would be lucky if their chef's could regularly put out a fish and chips dish at that level. And they CERTAINLY wouldn't be doing it for under $14.

In classic British form, the shop's front window gives you a view to the ""kitchen"" (open). You can see for yourself not only how fresh everything is, but how clean and well managed it is. I love that they have seating that overlooks the direction of the kitchen for when you're here solo. I'll definitely be back in the next 10 days to try their ""of the month"" which in September 2017 is JERK. I can't wait!",2017-09-21 16:44:44

After a week or so, the countryside beckons and I head out to the villages, find a little local restaurant in what was once a family home and become enveloped in true French hospitality and cuisine.

Or, I just go here.

Others have said it all, and very well.  The owner is a delight.  Flirts with my wife.  AND my mother-in-law.  (In a few years, probably my daughter, too.  They're all babes, so I'm used to it.)

Quirky, quaint, and quixotic.  Quiet, most nights.  If you haven't yet been, why?

I took the 506 across from Yonge and I knew it was going to be a bit of a ride along Carlton and Gerrard to get to Greenwood.  When I arrived at Greenwood and crossed the street I noticed there was a bit of a line up.  I thought to myself was this line up for Maha?  It was about 1:20pm in the afternoon on a Tuesday and there was a line of about 20 people in front of me.  For the 10 or so minutes I was there the line did not move at all.  I was meeting a friend and I was texting saying that there was going to be a bit of a wait.

I was in line pretty far away from the storefront so I couldn't even see how busy it was inside.  I asked the person in front of me to confirm if this was the line for Maha and she had said yes.  I said wow this was quite the busy place.  She said that they were featured on TV and blogs so I could see how this place would be packed.  That happens in the city sometimes where a place gets popular and then it's harder to get into the place at least for a while and sometimes that popularity can last.  

A server came out to the line looking for parties of 2.  The person in front of me who I had spoken to was a party of two so she moved right on in to get a table while everybody else in line was 3 or more it seemed.  Since I was a party of 2 I was hoping she'd return asking for another party of 2.  She did in fact come out and I was able to get a table outside on the patio for 2 before my friend arrived so it worked out.  It seemed rather lucky there were only 2 of us otherwise who knows how long we would have had to have waited to be able to get a table.  This place seems so popular that people are willing to wait in line mind you this around 1:30 on a weekday and there's a line.

When my friend arrived it didn't take us long to decide what to get.  We went with the Cairo Classic which is a plate of seasoned fava beans, tomato feta, sliced boiled eggs and balady bread with a single falafel ball.  For our other dish we wanted to try the mind blowing chicken which is a plate of salad with tomatoes, onions and parsley mixed with the chicken drizzled with mayo and tahini with more bread on the side.  To drink we ordered the black tea with mint.

We were catching up because we hadn't seen each other in about a year and a half and while the weather was basically perfect outside it seemed that the meals were taking quite some time to come.  It was quite busy the place but I rarely eat this late in the afternoon for lunch (now after 2pm).  The tea came and it had quite the presentation with tiny cups with mint coming out of the top of the pot.  When the food finally came we were quite famished.  I have to say the wait to get the food was only offset by the fact that we had pretty much been seated quite quickly and didn't have to wait too long in line luckily.  

The classic came out first and we had started on that.  The chicken shortly followed.  We were making space on the table the best we could considering we were sharing both dishes.  The servings are decently sized and the taste was good.  I especially liked the classic because the beans although spiced were not overwhelming.  The falafel was good as was everything that made up the classic plate and I especially liked the texture of the balady.  The chicken and salad while good didn't really blow my mind.  I'm not sure if the anticipation or the wait made it more of a higher expectation but overall for both dishes and the experience I can't say if I had to wait longer that it would have been worth it.  

The wait for the plates was quite long to the point I was getting worried.  We had some places we wanted to go that day and we had to skip one because time didn't really permit.  From being seated (around 1:30pm) to the time we ended up paying and leaving it was about 3:15pm.  That's almost 2 hours for us at the table ordering, waiting, and eating.  While the food was enjoyable the chicken salad dish wasn't spectacular (it didn't necessarily blow my mind) the wait seemed much longer than expected.  If it was this busy on a Tuesday afternoon and it was this long for the food to normally be served I can't say it was really worth it.",2017-07-31 15:26:23

You will be locked in one of the rooms in an hour to try to solve many of the puzzles to unlock and advance to the next one. Six rooms are available to chose from, all different from each other, so the first challenge is to chose which one. The staff is very friendly and the waiting room or lobby makes you feel in a different world already. It can be quite addictive and expensive if you want to try all six rooms (more to come I hear), so it would be nice if they had a package deal to get a multiple of rooms for a better price or some kind of a year pass (for those who do not succeed in solving the rooms on their first try. I made that suggestion to one of their staff and they were happy to pass it along.

Great for a group of people too, and you can find some deals on Groupon as well.
Good for kids over 12 maybe because the puzzles are quite challenging, but would be fun for a family ""adventure""; I recommend for anyone to try it, and I promise you will come back for more (which is why it would help if they offer a package deal); I will not suggest a room over any other because they are all quite unique...",2017-02-22 09:04:31

Broths: I got the tonkatsu broth, which includes two sauces - Goma and Ponzu.  The server added a few extra seasonings to my sauces (I can't remember everything he put in there, but I do remember chilli oil and sesame seeds).  My brother got the spicy miso broth and that was full of flavor.  I've been to other shabu shabu places, and I've never had broth like this.

I ordered the Yojie's Cut dinner Sumo size (10oz of beef).  This comes with rice, veggies, and noodles.  The 10oz was super filling, but it was so good that I wanted more!  I like the presentation of the beef and veggies.  

For dessert, we ordered the strawberry and bananas fondue with green tea white chocolate.  I'm not typically a fan of green tea chocolate, but I was mind blown with the flavor.  It was shared with 6 people, so it didn't go to waste.  Typically, this dessert can be shared with 2-3 people.

APPETIZER: Brussels Sprouts ($7)
--------------------------------------------------­­---------------------
Smoked Cheese Sauce, Parmesan, toasted mustard seed. Pretty tasty. A little cheesy, a little salty. 

APPETIZER: Buffalo Cauliflower ($8)
--------------------------------------------------­­---------------------
Beer battered cauliflower, buffalo hot sauce, ranch dressing. SO GOOD. Standout out of all the dishes. Unfortunately, looking at other Yelpers' pictures, it seems like either it's not regulated or they've shrunk the portion, but we got maybe 10 pieces. It didn't really fill the plate, but other Yelpers' pictures look like they're about to overflow. Delicious nonetheless.

MAIN: Chicken & Waffles ($16)
--------------------------------------------------­­---------------------
Crispy chicken, sour cream, spicy maple, green onion, sourdough waffles. A waffle sliced diagonally sandwiching three pieces of boneless fried chicken. The syrup was great. Not too spicy or overpowering. The sour cream was an interesting addition. Can't say it added much, but I like sour cream. The chicken was crispy and could've been a tad juicier, but it was delicious nonetheless.

MAIN: Home of the Brave Burger ($13)
--------------------------------------------------­­---------------------
House ground ribeye, HOTB pickle mayo, House American cheese, Tomato, Lettuce. I don't like pickles or pickled things, but I didn't taste anything overpowering. The burger was just delicious. I don't like when burgers don't come with any sides. I don't consider it a complete main course and a bit of a money-grab, but the burger was good though. 

There are actually more desserts than are shown on their website's menu. We had these two:

DESSERT: Fluffer Nutter ($6)
--------------------------------------------------­­---------------------
Twist, peanut butter sauce, marshmallow coated ruffles, peanuts, white & milk chocolate. Lots of peanuts. That's the predominant flavour with this ice cream cone. The first few bites were like peanuts, peanuts, chocolate, and more peanuts. They give you a dish so that you can lay it sideways and eat it with spoons because I bet it'd get messy otherwise. The ruffles aren't that prominent, but the chunks that you do find are delicious. 

DESSERT: Red Velvet Funnel Cake ($8)
--------------------------------------------------­­---------------------
Red velvet batter, fresh berries, cream cheese icing, sweet Jesus vanilla soft serve. Way too sweet and I usually like sweet stuff like white chocolate. Maybe they've improved the batter because despite other reviews, the funnel cake was not hard at all. It wasn't fully crispy either. I guess it was a comfortable middle. The cream cheese icing is overkill. With the ice cream, the dish is already sweet. The icing makes the dish unbearably sweet. Everything else was pretty good. 

I was satisfied with every dish with the exception of the icing on the funnel cake. The portions weren't huge (despite our server's warning), but I think you could comfortably share an appetizer with someone, have your own main, possibly skip the dessert, and be satisfied. We ordered everything just cause we wanted to try it all. 

Aside from the obvious choice of fried chicken and waffles, the buffalo cauliflower was a clear standout. Would definitely recommend that one.",2015-09-03 18:05:37

The bbq served here is just as good and consistent as their location in Vegas. Difference here is, the dining area is not rinky dinky and you can get your bbq fix till 2 in the morning!! Well, at least the night owls, swing shift workers and hangry people tired of getting tacos late night welcome it for sure!

--BBQ--
I skip sandwiches and go for all meat!! Yeah, straight up hardcore! The 3 meat combo...sure why not it's just a couple dollars more. $19 gets you your choice of 3 different meats and one side. Good size portions too. I had enough to share with Mr. B. 

Spareribs still my favorite, see why here [ http://www.yelp.com/biz/jessie-raes-bbq-las-vegas ] then pulled pork and then brisket. The first two being the fattier cuts of meat of course. Yum!

Mike bbq pitmaster/owner used a combo of apricot and hickory woods to smoke the meats. Combined with the spice rub used, you got a smokin hot bbq, with winning trophies to prove it from well known bbq competitions.

There's 3 different sauces offered. A spicy one. A killer hot sauce, and THE God Sauce!! This bbq sauce is sweet and fruity based.  Really should be renamed Crack Sauce, because I really wanted more and was tempted to snag the bottle from the table and take it with me, like a crack addict would. It's not for sale, I asked already. But it's in the works!!

--SIDES--
I stick with the usual, corn with smoked garlic butter! The coleslaw was nice, more fruity light taste, less mayo based.  Mac n cheese was ok, but then again, not much a pasta fan, so others may like it more than I do.

--ENVIRONMENT--
NAYS -  21 AND OVER ONLY - SMOKING is allowed - No walled off/enclosed area between bar and dining area. 

YAYS - There's more room and more seating. Full menu available from early am till late night! The bar itself is pretty chill, The patrons hanging out on Friday night was a fun bunch. Good vibe and good dancin playlist I might add. 

--SERVICE--
Not quite ready but functional.

The staff was pretty friendly and helpful the times I went. Met up for early dinner with my favorite friends Jessie B and Jaime W. The dining room had a closed sign but owner/bartender seated us, gave us menus and took our drink order. 

Mike came out and took our order and served us too. He apologized profusely for not having everything set up yet.  He's the only one so far here, still in the process of hiring and getting a POS system in place.  So for now you have to pay at the bar.  No worries from us.

Second visit in, I just took my order to go. I called first and was told to place order at bar, so I did. Bartender knew the menu when I asked what sides I could get with my combo order. Waited a couple minutes in the dining area and another guy came out of the kitchen with my order already bagged up, but took out each box and personally verified my order per the boss man. I liked that!!!

Also, it was 80's night. Okay, if they expect me to deal with AC/DC and GNR remixes they need to GIVE me some 80's to deal with that. The workers were in their 80's garb dancing atop the couches (I totally just typed ""douches""). I kept getting nasty, poofy hair in my face. It was everywhere.

There were NO cute guys and NONE of them were buying any drinks for the ladies.
No one was really dancing. If they call swaying like a blade of grass in the wind dancing...get me the hell out of there.

Loved the restaurant set up, I can't remember my waitors name but he was awesome, great attitude and positive vibe. Very much appreciated. 

FOOD:
Man oh man... I started off with the ceviche which I'm very very picky about. Super fresh and tender octopus, shrimp wasn't fishy, and had a nice citrus touch. I ordered the seafood enchiladas and my significant other ordered the carnitas. Both were outstanding. I'm not saying the enchiladas werent delicious but I definitely will be going back for my own carnitas. Cooked to perfection crispy outside and juicy inside, seasoned just right, best carnitas I've ever had in Vegas. 
Let's not forget about the margaritas, nice and flavorful and strong. I got the jalapeno one, spicy kick, and the tamarind one was tangy. Recommend both. Even the salsa and chips were good here! All worth the price! 

Will be going back for sure.",2017-09-12 16:58:22

Gave the restaurant a call to make a reservation but was told it would not be possible as they were fully booked. However, was suggested to get there before 6pm for a seat. I obliged. 

Got there at 5:38pm and had a great start as there wasn't a lineup! Was quickly seated and server payed close attention. Started with the free KFC(Korean fried cauliflower). Mind was completely blown at how they made cauliflower taste like fried chicken!

Next came the pit master for 2, corn bread and collard greens. On the pit master there was 3 delicious meats to chow down to. First the brisket. Oh my god did it melt in your mouth. Extremely succulent. Ribs just fell right of the bone. Chicken thighs were battered to perfection and golden. Every bite just made me want more. The collard greens were standard. The cornbread was okay.

I have to disagree with others about the service once you're seated, I was taken care of on both my visits by a young waiter and  waitress. They got to me as soon as they could and checked up on how I was enjoying my food multiple times and if I needed refills. Maybe I came at a good time when they were less busy but for 10-12 full tables 2 or 3 of them seemed to do just fine making everyone happy.

Beer-battered avocado tacos: the sauce reaaaally makes the taco for me (and of course, the avocados)

The Thrillist: basically the chicken sandwich but with donut (yes, DONUT) buns and soy bacon strips. I felt really adventurous that day, but honestly I like the regular chicken sandwich a lot more.

BBQ pulled jackfruit tacos: very tangy, not my favorite since it was too BBQ-ey, but still very tasty.

I had a hard time trying to figure out what was what on the menu.  I'm so used to seeing the nigiri sushi in Romaji English.  I forgot this is Las Vegas.  I sat on the bar and listened to a couple of Mexican ladies complaining that the ""spicy"" sushi wasn't hot.  ""You call Jalapeno hot?""  Oh, this is not going to be good.

They're pretty generous with the two-hour time limit.  I had a double order of nigiri maguro, hamachi, saba, unagi and sake - tuna, yellowtail, mackerel, eel and salmon.  The cuts were horrible, the fish undersized and the quality average.  The maguro was a light pink rather than a rich red, which would identify it as either previously frozen or possibly tombo - a low quality tuna.  On a positive note, the rice was served warm and portioned suitably for drinking/snacking.

Sushi Kaya has a large selection of specialty maki (handroll) with eye-catching names like Crazy Orgasm, Who is my dad? and Sex bomb,  I ordered the Lasagna Roll which consisted of a baked California Roll with Philly cream cheese and unagi sauce.  This was the best thing I had.  I also ordered the Viagra Roll - deep fried tempura style maki with maguro, sake, hamachi, avocado and masago (fish roe).  Not bad,  but not great either.

To round off my dinner I ordered the Sho Chiku Bai Nigori for $12.  Not a bad deal.  When I asked for my check I had 3 of 6 pieces of the Viagra Roll and 2 of 8 pieces of the Lasagna Roll on my plate.  The waitress informed me that if I didn't eat everything, the restaurant might charge me for the leftovers.  My response ""Go ahead if that's what you guys think is right.""

I ordered the special of the day which was a breakfast croissant with 2 eggs cooked the way you want, two sausages or two slices of bacon--your choice--and your choice of cheese.  It also came with breakfast potatoes they called hash browns.  They're really not hash browns but they were very good potatoes.

Everything was very good.  My coffee was refilled quickly.  Angel, the server, was very pleasant!

Angel brought a case with pastries--doughnuts, cupcakes, etc--and at first I thought she was offering a complimentary one.  When she told me the price, I then knew they weren't freebies.

I did not eat anything but tried their house martini.  A mistake I won't make twice.  I'm sure it was a fine martini but it definitely was not tasty to me.  The server did bring me some coke so that I could mix it and at least finish my drink. 
The most fun came in searching for the bathroom.  On the way they had an empty elevator shaft with a glass bottom so that you could step out on it and look down.  Kind of fun actually.  Once I made it upstairs it was not easy to find the bathroom that was located at the end of a hall of mirrors.  The doors have no outside handles so I walked past them initially as with the mirrors and the dancing figures painted on the doors it felt more like a dance studio then a bathroom.  After much fun searching we discovered that if you push the doors it opens into a bathroom.  Kind of a fun set up once your in the know.

It tooks 45 minutes to get some appetisers and then another hour for steak to arrive. Are you really that busy?? Do you know we are paying more than $600 to get that kind of treatment?

Absolutely never come here. He even put the steak at the wrong place!! I ordered medium and get medium rare while my girl ordered a medium rare and get a medium. 

How f up can u be if you dont even know how to serve one table?  From my experience, I would never come to this steakhouse anymore, if you are in Las Vegas and u want to pay a satisfying steakhouse, go to Vick and Anthonys in Golden Nugget. Now thats' a steakhouse!!!!",2011-10-08 03:25:04

Also they have a new combo I'd be interested in checking out. For $9 you get a sandwich or salad, chips or popcorn, a banana and a water bottle not bad at all.

As for the food, the burgers are unique, I think the actual burgers are ok but the flavors they add are what makes them. Their truffle fries are amazing and highly recommend. The onion rings are also good but different, they have a little sweetness due to the coconut they use in the batter. I normally don't like coconut but these were really good.

We arrived tonight around 5:45pm. We were promptly seated and our server arrived within minutes of us being seated. She was very nice and attentive. I asked her how the mojitos were and she suggested that I get one. Unfortunately I would have to say the mojito was probably the best item of the night. My fiancé ordered the filet cooked medium and I ordered the King's combo (fried shrimp, fish and scallops). The shrimp were pretty good, the fish was okay and the scallops were just the same as the last time I reported, gritty. My fiancé's steak was severely under seasoned and had no flavor at all. He also got a baked potato which instead of being overcooked (previous visit) it was cold in the middle. I got coleslaw and corn as sides. The corn was good but the coleslaw had no flavor at all.

My family has been buying meat from John Mull's for over 40 years and the quality and customer service have always been top-notch. Chuck Frommer is a 2nd generation butcher and owner following his father and an uncle keeping the shop as a family run business since 1955. This certainly speaks to the consistent product quality John Mull's turns out. Chuck is on the premises everyday working in the shop as is his wife, making sure their customers are getting the best of service.  

  A lot of folks are gun-shy when it comes to purchasing meat from a butcher shop as opposed to the grocery store because they think the prices are going to be substantially higher. This is not the case at John Mull's. The prices at Mull's are very competitive with those at the supermarket and the quality of the meat and poultry is head and shoulders above the grocery stores meat. Checkout their website and you can compare the prices to what you find at your neighborhood store. John Mull's is also a game processing facility where hunters have been bringing their deer, turkey and wild boar to be butcher for decades.

  John Mull's is also home to the Roadkill Grill which was recently featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.

It's a rather large place, with a register in the very front, a long salad bar (think Whole Foods) in the middle, some tables and big, comfy booths. There's also a small dessert case and some books, snacks and supplements for purchase. All vegan.

Before stopping in, I checked out the menu so I was pretty sure of what we wanted- just a snack to share and a smoothie. We ordered the Cheese Fries and a large Berry Good smoothie. The portion was small. Extremely small, for $8. As was the $8 smoothie. I would have hated to see what the actual small smoothie size looked like.

We got 2 or 3 normal sized waffle fries and the rest were like the remnants in the bottom of the bag, which only took up 1/3 of a small salad plate. They weren't crispy. At all. In fact, and I even hate to say it, but they were soggy. The vegan cheese was melted (as much as it can be). It was like they put them in a microwave. I buy the Alexia waffle fries and the same vegan cheeses they have, and use them on a daily basis, so I know what's up.. My son, who's the fry king, didn't even want to eat them. That might not really mean anything to you, but that speaks volumes to me. He's legit a fry critic. If they are actually good, he'll wolf them down. But he doesn't like soggy fries. Sorry. The pico and guac were meh. It seemed like there wasn't anything on the plate that was made in house. But there were micro greens decorating the plate.

The smoothie was good. It's hard to mess up a smoothie though. But for $8, I can't believe at how small it was. I'm going to give them another shot because I do really want to like it and it's somewhere that can accommodate all of our families food allergies/intolerances.",2017-03-19 04:33:00

The dim sum is ok.  I've had better uptown but by downtown standards, its totally adequate.

The worst thing about this place is that as you walk in, there is no numbering system while you wait. The guy who is the host just eyeballs you and you hope that he remembers the order when people came in.  There is also a back section that i've never been to but the line up system at the back is equally as confusing.

The service is fast and the staff is typical for Chinatown. They take your order without too much small talk.  When i asked questions about some of the dishes (since my chinese is not fluent nor can i read every character), they are patient and polite in trying to respond in english eventhough it is clearly not their first language.

The nightime menu items are pretty decent.  I would not recommend the striploin beef ribs there.  It is tough, chewy, and does not taste great.  The cantonese chow mein or chicken/salty fish fried rice are good.  The food comes fairly quickly.

As a southerner, 2 hours from LA, I have higher expectations of cajun food than others.  E.g Hot & Juicy would be slightly above average compared to what you can get in the South when looking at quality and price.  But everything is relative to where you live, so this place really stands out for cajun/louisina food.

 I ordered the Crawfish Etoufee and cup of Gumbo.  The Etoufee was well seasoned and spiced.  I liked the bread they served with the Etoufee to mop up all the juice.  The gumbo could have used a little more kick.  

Next time I'll be sure to try the charbroiled oysters, soft shell crab, bronzed catfish n grits, and the new orleans style bbq shrimp.

I come here once a month for all my Korean and Japanese staples, including some of the harder to find items that you can't find at T&T Supermarket. It's always fun to just wander the aisles and look at all the new and interesting products I may have missed on the last visit and everytime I come back, I am surprised.

Arirang carries a vary vast selection of everything you could possibly need for Korean and, to a smaller extent, Japanese cooking. All the basic staples like rice, seaweed, gochujang, ssamjang, house-made kimchi, pickles, sauces and spices are all here. They also have a fully-stocked meat department with all the great cuts you're used to. 

The staff is kind and helpful, always friendly and willing to help you find what you're looking for. If you go next door through the doorway by the freezers, there's a great shop for all kinds of houseware items like dolsot stone bowls, ceramic pots, butane burners, plates, serving ware and more. 

If you come by on a nice Sunday afternoon, the bakery next door may have some nice hot Bungeoppang (the red bean fish pastries) fresh from the iron!

The convenient location is perfect if you want to do all your grocery shopping since Community Natural Foods is next door and Co-op is a short walk away.

Perhaps the lunch buffet is still a good deal for the quality and quantity of the food they serve.  For dinner, it's offensive to charge $.99 for a side of rice to go with an order of Chicken Tikka Masala.  It's not an issue of the cost, but the principle of the matter.  Obviously, I'm going to order the rice.  Just up the price of all the dishes by a buck and throw us a bone with ""free"" rice.  And nearly $3 for a bowl of soupy Raita?

So I asked him what he felt like and bam he said, good thai at reasonable prices. The thought of Thai Country Kitchen came to mind. Now I have never been to Thai Country Kitchen but I've heard nothing but good reviews about this place. Thai Country Kitchen is located along Spadina near the end of the north side of chinatown and kinda looks like a hole in the wall place. No special decor and tho we went to dinner pretty late, there wasn't huge traffic only a few tables. Which sometimes could be a red flag.

My friend and I started ordering and wanted to get a decent amount of food. We started with a calamari appetizer and it wasn't bad. It was freshly deep fried and it was deep fried just enough. However, it did feel like it came from a frozen package, but surprisingly it was okay. For this price, you can't complain.

We ordred pad thai, a panang curry with beef and a yellow curry with chicken all with coconut rice. We also ordered a shrimp pad thai and thought it was slightly above average where once again no complaints. The noodles were cooked well, the flavour was good and it was saucy enough where it wasn't too saucy nor was it dry. And I would probably say, it was the curries which were a surprise. They were delicious. Now, I like my curry a little sweet, some even say I like it a little too sweet but meh. The curry that we were served had good consistency and the texture was well balanced. It wasn't watery or too thick, it was perfect. I liked the flavour and for me, outta the two I did like the panang curry slightly better than the yellow curry. But seriously both were definitely good. I felt the coconut rice was a little lacking, but that was probably the only negative.

Overall, I have to say I liked Thai Country Kitchen. Is it a good looking restaurant, no. But the food and the prices were definitely good. You can tell its family owned and operated where they cared about the food and how their customers were treated. And yes, my water was always filled without asking. So I would definitely come back if I was in the region and they have lunch specials too. Thai Country Kitchen will grow on you if you give it a chance.",2011-07-06 04:18:16
