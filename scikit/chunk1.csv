Very authentic and balanced Eritrean/Ethiopian food.

Mostly meat dishes on the menu with a three vegetarian options. The proportions are HUGE and they give you more than enough injera to finish your dish (and someone else's!).

1-2 stars for the grounds & amenities.

3-4 stars for prices, staff & the service I got.

I'll go with 3.

In general, Spa Lamar feels very run down. Very sad. It is not like larger hotel spas in the area so don't come in with that expectation.

All spa areas are co-ed, so you gotta keep your clothes on.

No food on-site, but they ordered Jason's Deli for us and had it delivered. No booze either, and we didn't bring our own. Shucks.

Pool wasn't working and it was 105 out. No lounge chairs, just wooden chairs, so do not come here to lay out until that problem is fixed. 

Massage was good - can't believe how quick 85 minutes go. The prices are higher than a chain like Massage Envy, but much more reasonable than a big hotel spa for instance.

In summary: Don't come here to take advantage of the amenties (there are few). Come for the treatments and bounce.",2012-10-10 01:36:44

Donuts are no exception as they are my weakness of all weaknesses.  You can bribe me, tempt me, or buy things from me with donuts.  But don't mix my fondness of donuts with the stereotype that Cambodians like to own donut shops.  I am Cambodian but I'm a person first and I just happen to love me some bomb diggity donuts.  Low and behold, Donut Parlor.  The answer to the heavy busy street of Elliot and Priest, near the I-10 freeway.  They are situated from the street view on Elliot Road, so you cannot miss them.  

What I love most about the donuts here is its simplicity and pure quality and taste.  It begins with that mentality that makes them outstanding.  If there is one kind of donut that I often go for, it is the classic raised glazed.  I measure a place by how soft, chewy and tasty it is.  Donut Parlor did exceptionally well in this department.  One can never go wrong with this selection.  Most of their donuts in fact are raised based.  

Some of the raised options include cereal toppings with colorful icing.  Essentially you are faced with a dilemma of trying to choose your favorite childhood cereal, anywhere from Fruity Pebbles, Cocoa Puffs, Lucky Charms, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

My other raised favorites are the Twisties, the ones that look like hair braids and to a limited raised extent the Fritters--soft, chewy, with a hint of crispiness.  

Beyond the donuts, you can also order special fruit smoothies like watermelon and plenty others.  Because I'm in my summer dieting routine, I've opted for some strong, smooth, delicious coffee, straight up black.  For sure, I would order that over and over with a raised glazed donut.

The decor is a modern industrial look--clean and simple.  The donuts are displayed in a clear glass above a bamboo counter with some marble trimming.  The folks behind the counters are extremely friendly and humble and will not hesitate to deliver you the best service you can get for a high quality Mom-n-Pops.

The future is bright for Donut Parlor.  I know they plan on introducing more to the menu in the future.  Stay tune to my posts, picture uploads, and check-ins.",2016-07-04 01:28:09
L9SznzAG59PZ1hS9SXRRtw,_uqIpl5tzucKuIlZZPBZRw,NFm869_w6cvVaWaNpAzjeA,5,5,2,3,"We went to Soul this past Saturday night for dinner for the first time.  We were impressed by our initial entrance.  The restaurant/bar is situated on the 2nd floor of an old restored brick building.  The outdoor seating offered fantastic views of the Charlotte Uptown skyline.  Inside there are a few booths (with high backs), a few tables, a bar, a DJ booth with stools, and some sofas and chairs.  All in all, it offered a great, casual, fun atmosphere.  The place was ""hopping,"" but luckily, we were seated right away at some empty stools indoors around the DJ booth (who wasn't there at the time).  

The menu offers a variety of tapas.  We had a hard time picking out which ones we would order, but finally were able to narrow it down to five to share.  We chose the (1) Sashimi Tuna Tacos, (2) Lamb Lollipops, (3) Bone Marrow, (4) Boursin Cheese Stuffed Piquillo Peppers on Bruschetta, and (5) the Sushi Crunch Roll.   The tuna tacos were very flavorful and were like very mini tacos.  The lamb was good and tender, but I probably wouldn't order them again because I'd rather try some of their other (cheaper) skewers of meat.  We were adventurous with the bone marrow, but it was our least favorite and something we wouldn't order again.  It was a little too gel-like for my taste, although one of them tasted like egg (?).  The bruschetta was creamy and rich with flavor.  I'd definitely order that again.  The sushi crunch roll was huge!  It was very wide, so we had to cut it in half before eating it.  I liked it, but I've had better crunch rolls, so I'd try a different kind of sushi roll next time.  

Our server was fantastic.  She was very friendly and, being that it was our first time, she explained a little bit about the menu.  Even though she had several other tables, she kept checking on us after each tapas was brought out.  

All in all, we had a fantastic time and it's a great place to hang out for a date night, with friends, or to bring out-of-town guests who like a vibrant scene.",2010-05-17 13:42:51

I stalk them regularly on twitter and Instagram for daily menus and their current location, which they are great about sharing.

To date we've tried the black bean tacos and the curried potato tacos (my favorite!!), but they also have a tofu taco on occasion and a samosa type choice which I'm desperate to try. I'll have to keep stalking I guess!
The turn around has always been quick considering the quality of the product. The ingredients are incredibly fresh and high quality. They even offer vegan cheese and I believe all tacos are 100% gluten free! Bonus!

This is sadly just a review of the consistent failures presented to us within 5mins of entering the establishment, as I opted to save myself further stress and indignation and leave without having a meal here.

I arrived at 1:27p.m. for Brunch with two friends, unfortunately 12 mins past our reservation time of 1:15p.m.. However they were willing to seat us due to this horrendous tardiness on our part *Note sarcasm* (We were stuck in the freezing cold, warring with the pay and park machine which only took coins or credit card and would eject the credit card until we were forced to allocate change). The Hostess was kind enough to ask if the seating in the bar, with high chairs and tables would be ""ok"", She never truly expected me to say ""No it's not ok, I am in a short dress and 4 inch heels"" You could at this point see the world about her crumble, as she had no idea how to actually deal with me refusing the seating arrangement. I asked her why they would take a reservation and then within less that 15mins of the booking give away my table? 
Without another word she ran off to speak with the other hostess seated at the laptop, who called out from where she was sitting that our reservation was for 1:15p.m. As the 2nd Hostess returned, I asked her once more if there were any other options, she stated no and progressed to lead us to the bar area, I at this point refused to continue with this and told her thank you but no, I was then met with a rather nasty snarky remark of "" Well good luck with that"" beautiful and professional service from an establishment in Yorkville no less.
My guests and I at this point left, as if they could not even hold a reservation for 15mins there was no point in enduring this location further. 
We returned to the car and I called to speak to the manager, I was met with a voice mail, left on hold a second time for 5 mins and so on. My boyfriend at this point called to find out what the issue was, and the Hostess then stated my name and said ""Oh this is the 'name' party"" He said yes and was put through to a male who informed us that our reservation was at 12:15... REALLY? A restaurant unable to actually make a reservation and the manager on site and the Hostess having different times? I suspected this level of unethical conduct was perhaps commonplace at this restaurant at this point.. to lie to your patrons.
Not only were they unable to actually seat us, when there was a table at the bottom of the stairs that we could see was empty and could seat up to 12 guests, but taking the correct time for a reservation was beyond their ability. He continued his condescending apology and stated ""Well if you had waited 5 mins, other seats were available and opening up. Half our restaurant was closed"" NOT only did his Hostess refuse any other options when asked, but had frankly dismissed us in a haughty manner with added bonus of a nasty comment. All I received from this gentleman was an arrogant apology without a solution, at this point we left the area and proceeded to have lunch elsewhere. 
This experience from a Yorkville establishment, that tries to project an upscale image? I was disappointed yet relieved to never be compelled to return. 
Perhaps, if they trained their staff on how to take correct reservations and how to communicate with patrons they would have scored higher and be at the level of a basic McDonald's. 
After reading the other reviews posted on Yelp, I am glad we didn't stay. Unethical, consistently incompetent behaviour should never be rewarded and this seems to be the standard of this Cibo location.
I caution you before choosing this location, staff are lacking and as one reviewer said ""It's lipstick on a pig"" with their renovations. Your restaurant might look good, but your service and food is what makes you exceptional... yet your establishment has failed at the very basics of service, I shudder to think what your food is like.

For a good brunch experience with servers who know what they are doing, and for exquisite food I suggest Sunday Brunch at the Omni, well worth it...

At some point they filtered back in to finish their half melted ice cream treats. I have to say as a local I will only return with out of towners who appreciate the novelty of the place. It is just your average ice cream shop.",2013-07-12 23:00:34

Their appetizers are the stars here.  We really enjoy the cold spring rolls (shrimp and pork), crispy egg rolls (solo shrimp is an option), and crispy rice with egg (seriously, this is the one to try!). Their rolls are nicely filled, and served with delicious dipping sauces.
 
My husband and I have tried their pho and vermicelli entrees.  For pho, I prefer the seafood noodle soup, and my husband prefers the beef varieties.  Sometimes, the broth is a bit more flavorful on different visits.  But I really like that different sizes are available for various appetites.  

Service has improved since they initially opened.  They are now speedier, and while we still aren't fond of the pop music they stream, we appreciate how efficient they've become.

Their menu has also expanded since opening.  They now have a shrimp vermicelli dish on their menu that is OUTSTANDING.  It rivals Lang Van's vermicelli bowl (seriously).  The shrimp are huge, plentiful, and extremely flavorful.  

Their prices are very reasonable, too.  If you've tried them before and decided not to return, I highly recommend that you give them another try.",2014-11-30 01:11:49

The leek seafood pancake ($13.99) is loaded with seafood and is a very sizable portion. It's crispy, light, and not greasy. Comes with kimchi, japchae, and bean sprouts. 

The Bulgogi bento box ($10.99) has a heaping portion of good-quality lean sliced beef and comes with three dumplings, kimchi, and japchae. Also comes with a mountain of purple rice, which is much nicer than the standard steam rice served elsewhere.

xAFQ1qnlie4uwEpMS8Ze8Q,P2sQVHyHmy4WA0I7NI5hWg,6Pk9PJOD7EWd1tv3lk0ajA,5,8,0,2,"Living in a town of spas and resorts, with so many local ""stay-cation"" destinations, there is fierce competition to offer the best amenities, facilities, pools, spas, dining, and relaxation.  My number one choice for all of the above is Firesky.  Romantic, intimate, superior accommodations, outstanding food and drinks, unbeatable amenities, outstanding customer service from the front desk to the bar and grill.

Things I love about Kimpton Hotels as a whole:

1.  The ""In Touch"" loyalty program:
-Customizing your stay and an added surprise.
Not only can you customize your personal preferences such as the type of pillows you want on your bed, or whether you want a yoga mat in your room, but you receive a $10 ""raid the mini bar"" card upon each check'in.
-The mini bar is fantastic with everything your snack-loving heart could desire from Goodie bags with gummy bears to Clif and Luna bars, organic dried fruit, Snickers, nuts, and even more specific essentials such as Tylenol, band-aids, and intimacy kits ranging from $3.50-$6.00.
-Free Wi-Fi in your room and around the resort.

2.  Meeting all of your needs with amenities galore.
-This is a big one! 
Perfect example of exceeding expectations here was although our room did not have a DVD player, the front desk had one sent up and connected for us, free of charge.  (I have stayed in other local hotels where there was a $25 charge just for having one in the room).
-A long list of complimentary items in (case you forgot them at home) such as computer/mobile chargers, feminine hygiene products, razors, clippers, USB cards, and humidifiers.
-Take one of their custom designed bikes around town, and you can even add a gourmet picnic basket
-Complimentary transportation within a 3 mile radius, perfect for going out in Old Town.
-Hosted complimentary wine hour every evening at 5p in the lobby.

3. Superior Accommodations.
-Pillow top mattresses and super plush feather pillows make their beds a dream come true
-Rain showers and C.O. Bigelow Bath and Body Products
-Funky and comfortable bath robes, ours were cheetah print
-Fully stocked honor bars
-Flat screen televisions

4.  Exclusive offers sent to your email. 
-Often that means you can get a room here for $99 - and if you find a better deal on another site (i.e. Hotels.com) they will not only match but either give you an additional credit, or in our case - matched the price and sent a bottle of chilled champagne to our room.

5.  Eco friendly practices:
-They recycle everything from phones to batteries.
-They buy organic coffees and teas 
- They serve organic wines during their evening complimentary wine hours. 
- The cleaning staff uses green products.

6. Pet Friendly.
-Pet beds and food and water bowls delivered to your room.
-Your furry friend even gets a welcome board with his or her name.

Things I love about Firesky:

1.  Taggia Restaurant.
Coastal Italian with modern twists, superior ingredients.  Locally sourced ingredients, seafood flown in fresh daily.
-A must try and one of the best pastas I have had: Chitarra (langoustines, artichokes, truffles, mascarpone).
-Offers delectable pastas, pizzas, halibut, scallops, even roasted bone marrow.
-Extensive wine list, custom cocktails such as Prickly Pear margaritas or Basil Pear Gimlets

2.  The Property.
Small, intimate, easy to get around - has the look and feel of a Hawaiian resort.
-Torch-lit Pool, known by this name at night when torches magically illuminate the pool has poolside bar and wait service, ideal for adults, and features some comfortable canopied day beds.  No tto mention the ""Aqua Bar and Grill"" has fanstic burgers.
-The Sandy Beach pool is ideal for families and young children, and features a sandy beach
-The Lagoon.  Sitting areas and fire pits make this a perfect and calming space for relaxing with the morning paper, or sitting around a fire with friends at night.

Absolutely perfect in every way!",2013-08-15 16:16:34

We found a sofa and put down $150 since the sales person said it was 4 weeks back order. In the mean time he said that the item wouldn't be ordered until it was paid in full. We came across something nicer that we liked better and now Ashley is refusing to refund us the $150 that they took and did nothing for us. The item was never ordered so I believe it's unfair and unethical to keep money and deliver nothing in return. I understand when returned furniture there is a restocking fee but we didn't even have the item ordered.  I will never shop here ever again.

The only dish worth any attention was the ""Poppers"" which featured raw ahi and hamachi on crispy potato cakes with tobiko. It was delicious, however, did not justify the 22 dollar price tag. I also tried the king salmon, scalloped potatoes and roasted artichoke (who drowns a small dish of chopped up artichoke hearts in overpowering goat cheese, and for 15 dollars?) and mini donuts; all of which only deserve a shrug. 

The service was substandard; we felt ignored. My fiancé is nowhere near as pretentious and particular as I am, however, he was equally disappointed with our meal and experience.

You can request a particular vet at each visit or get one a random. They are all so friendly it will be hard to choose! 

Dr. Sherl has been our pick so far. One of our dogs had to be sterilized fairly young due to a possible cancerous testicle. Our pup came out of the vet office in top-top shape.

It is quite a drive for us, about 30 to 40 mins but worth the trip for us given the excellent care our dogs receive.

Chicago style pizza dip
Bacon and beer nuts
Roast pork sandwich
Sweet Italian beef sandwich
Green chili pork
Poutine

Meeting at noon, the Goose Island Pub was empty save for two other patrons.  All sandwiches were shared between us.  I also ordered an iced tea which was refilled frequently.

Starting with the bacon and beer nuts and the Chicago style pizza dip, I found the beer nuts nice and spicy with small pieces of bacon mixed in.  The beer nuts were quite spicy.  The pizza dip is a different way of having pizza without getting a pie.  It's served with pieces of garlic crust and you spoon the dip onto the crust with some giardiniera (if you want) and it's quite good.

All three of the sandwiches had good flavors and the breads were soft and good.  The green chili pork sandwich was on a kaiser roll and had a fried egg.

Finally, I have to mention the poutine.  This is the only place in Las Vegas to get authentic poutine.  It was the first time I had tasted real poutine and it was quite good.  

Service was very good.  The place was very quiet.  I'm not sure if the Hard Rock's clientele were all interested in going to the pools but I sure saw a bunch of scantily clad ladies heading that way.

You simply walk up and ask for what you want and they fill the take out container to the brim. They usually have something on sale for a dollar or two off.  The food itself is mediocre, but every so often there is a diamond in the rough, mind you,  for the price, you can't say its bad.

Met my friend Mike E. (shout out to an elite yelper from Seattle in our area for the week!) for drinks and dinner on a Wednesday night and it was ideal.

We also had a sampling of the 3 salsa choices which were all quite unique but as you have all commented, the tortilla chips left a lot to be desired.
A spot opened on the patio so we moved our drinks outside and decided on dinner.  I went with the delicious grilled peach salad with chicken and found that even after an intense yoga class, the half portion was plenty.  As for my dining partner, he went with the servers suggestion and enjoyed pork chops with green beans.  Needless to say, we were both members of 'The clean plate club.'

First off, for anyone that looks at the outdoor spas like that in Blue Mountain or Whistler etc. I must caution you that this is quite a different atmosphere and significantly smaller area being indoors.
There was a great special (Mon-Thurs $35 for the baths) which we availed of. 
The locker rooms were very clean and excellently maintained with electronic bracelets to access the lockers. Bathrobes and towels included along with slippers.
Upon entering the spa i was first taken aback by the relatively compact size of it, but nevertheless I would find out later that the experience was very relaxing and refreshing. The hot bath was quite spacious with a waterfall and jets. 15 minutes in there was followed by a 15 second plunge in the cold pool next to it. We opted to go to the quite room in the far corner which was a great place to unwind in silence with the soothing music to relax your mind. The sauna was also a great hot therapy area and the cold shower followed that.
I was disappointed that the steam room was closed for renovations, but happy that I got to experience the other options.
There are plenty of beds, blankets, pillows and areas to rest, although I highly recommend going during the day time to avoid the evening rush.
Finally, what set this place apart was the fact that they had healthy fruit snacks and juices and tea around to keep you hydrated and refreshed. Definitely adds a great touch to the place.
Would return if I'm in Montreal.",2016-08-25 18:08:53

Admist the casino and other dining options, located next door to the sports bar area, we were told it would be a 15 minute wait but then called immediately. Score!

We were seated and given drinks shortly after. We saw the table next to us of 3 young boys (10-12) given 3 large pizzas for the 3 of them! We were in shock as they annhilated all 3 pies! they all passed out right after, and it was fun free entertainment.

My friend and I shared their caeser salad, which was really good but glad we asked for the dressing on the side. If you're not a fan of anchovies, avoid this salad as it's really strong. They also provide a side of egg yolk for the dressing as well, but we didn't touch it.

We then asked if we could do a half and half pizza as I'm a white sauce fan, friend is not. The waitress warned us that it would turn pink in the middle and we were okay with that. When I ordered the forager (mushrooms, bacon, spinach) and my friend ordered the margherita, the waitress then told us the whole pink sauce again (within 30 seconds of telling us the first time) and again, we told her it was okay.

Pizza arrived not too long later, and can't go wrong with woodfired pizzas. Mine was slightly burnt around certain parts, but it was super tasty. Hit the spot. My friend's margherita was excellent as well. I couldn't even finish 2 of the 3 slices, so we took it to go and it was a great midnight snack. The pizza was around $26 which was not bad at all.

The bar was completely crowded, which from our perception seemed like a very local group, it reminded us of the feeling we have at our go to spot, so we felt comfortable right away. We sat at a high top table in the lounge and immediately were greeted by our waiter, Ben!  Let me just say, even if the food was terrible, he made the experience five stars! The food was very tasty though! We ordered very small, just a bowl of cavatelli with a meatball, again we were just trying to get an idea of their cooking. Ben brought us out hot garlic rolls which were delicious and even replenished them once we devoured them. The pasta was cooked well, the sauce was up to par to me, an Italian girl who can cook a good sauce and the meatball was okay. Throughout the whole small meal, we had a few drinks and Ben never had us waiting or wondering where he was. He was on point, polite and just all around one of the best servers we've ever come across. We spoke briefly to him about our wedding and he surprised us with a bowl of Spumoni to finish our meal. It was chocolate, cherry and pistachio and they were fabulous! We will absolutely return, one for the top notch service and two to give some other dishes a try!",2018-05-09 14:49:25

If you're looking for a place for great soups and sandwiches, this is definitely the place to go! I haven't heard of this place before until one of my friends took me here. The decor is a little confusing with mismatched things here and there, but you get a sense of wholesomeness as you sit down to eat or sip coffee.

When Lazy Loaf & Kettle isn't catering, they serve a variety of breakfast items (french toast, pancakes, omelets, granola), sandwiches, soup, salads and deliciously tempting baked goods. Sandwiches start at around $7 and if you get a combo with a soup it will be around $11. A pretty PRICEY meal but definitely filling and fresh.

Once you walk in, you can grab an order form for a sandwich with your choice of condiments, cheese, deli (ham, Montreal smoked meat, roast beef, turkey, tuna/wild salmon salad, vegetarian, egg salad), and veggies.

I decided to try their special which happened to be a Turkey Melt (turkey, cheese, lettuce, mayo, tomato) on freshly baked cranberry bread with tomato dill soup. After ordering, you will be given a number and once it's ready servers bring it to your table. The sandwich was delicious! The bread was nicely toasted and the flavors melded perfectly together. The soup on the other hand didn't have enough dill and the texture was more like a marinara sauce which was off-putting.

Overall, I love how fresh the sandwiches and soups are and the specials keeps things interesting. I just find that the sandwiches are too pricey to make me a repeat customer (plus it's out of my way). However, I suggest at least a visit if you are in the area to try their specials. If you're at the University and have some time to kill it's also a great place to visit for a quick lunch.",2011-08-24 23:54:56

But if it's a good grocery store, who really cares? This one is my mom's favourite because they carry really good deli meats and a huge aisle of freshly baked bread from local Italian bakeries. This area of Scarborough used to have a huge Italian population, and the ones who still linger around will head over to Highland Farms or Colangelo's on Midland to get the best cuts of meat or the packs of tuna preserved in olive oil.

Their produce section is usually spotless and filled with gorgeous fruits and veg. I love walking through the aisles and picking my vegetables from the top of the food pyramids (or sometimes the bottom, if I feel like causing a bit of chaos for no reason) (I'm obviously kidding).

Anyway, if you live anywhere nearby, this is a great grocery store to pick up your necessities, and especially good if you have an interest in products imported from Italy or made by Italians. Prices are cheap and staff have always been nice to me, so no complaints!",2008-12-04 20:35:00

On the very corner of Arcadia's Gaslight Square is a hybrid dine-in restaurant with curbside catering. (If you're short on time prepared food is available for quick ""grab and go"".)

I popped in for a speed lunch with my Yelper friend Su-Shien and was *delighted* by the food, service and decor. Think fancy pants (chandeliers sprinkle the room) with rustic touches (cord is used to tie silverware). The space is intimate yet casual. Two top tables can readily be combined for larger groups. 

I would love to return for dining IN the kitchen. That's right: There's a bigger table where the magic happens. Friends of mine have eaten there and raved about it. (Soon!)

The food is made for sharing. Nosh boards range from meat, veges, cheese, fondue and (get this) plain ole' bread and butter. My first experience was with the charcuterie (meat) board. The menu doesn't do justice to what is delivered. Delicate sides accompany prosciutto, sopprasata, bresola and spanish chorizo. Thinly sliced wafers of bread can be layered with violet mustard, apple chutney and pickled shallots. We made our selection while enviously eyeing the table next to us.

....where The Very Jennifer was seated! She's a breath of fresh air! So sweet it (almost) hurts. You'll love her (and everyone else that works there).

My friend and I split the Roasted Pork Cuban Sandwich. The pork melted away, deliciously prepared and served on a brioch bun with a side of sea salt chips. Generously sized we were very happy with our portions

It is here that no detail goes unnoticed . . .from the interesting wall art that frames the wall by the stairs, to the marble bar to the copper accents and even the narrow restrooms with beautiful appointments- this place is a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.  And it is almost like two restaurants for there is an energy and noise level inside the restaurant that is totally opposite from the serenity that you might find with a table on the patio.

We sat outside and had just a wonderful time.  Our server, Leticia and the manager, David, went out of their way to make sure that everything was just perfect on this visit . . . .and it was.  We started with some of their sangria as well as drinks off their specialty cocktail menu.  We were very happy with Leticia's suggestion of a full bodied wine as we were less familiar with the Spanish choices on the menu . . .so much so that we drank two bottles of it!

The food is tapas and meant for sharing so leave the quantity of how much to order to your servers as they will not steer you wrong.  We ordered what sounded like a lot of food- but it ended up being just perfect.

So on to the food- know that if you want one of the three paella's- they do take 45 minutes to prepare so be sure to order it with your other choices.  We started with the Pan Con Tomate with ham which was really good.  Next up the bacon wrapped dates and the croquettes with manchango cheese . . . also quite good.  One of the specials on the day we were here was the grilled Spanish octopus which was probably my favorite served over a crispy slice of potato.

And then the Paella arrived.  We went with the meat version (there is also a veggie and a seafood version) but all three sounded amazing.  The Paella de carne mixta came with duck, pork rib and chorizo and was rich and decadent.  The rice absorbs the flavors of the meats along with the tomatoes and creates a richness that you can taste the second it goes in your mouth.

As for dessert- we tried some of the more odd sounding choices although the chocolate pudding with sea salt is purported to be their best seller.  Thinking we could get that most places- we chose to go with the fried milk and saffron ice cream (kind of like a deep fried flan) which I really liked although my dining companions didn't like the texture.  Our other choice was a combination of coffee ice cream with black olive marmalade (who comes up with these combinations?) served between slices of a nut wafer.  Certainly one of the most interesting flavor combinations I have had in a while.

A wonderful evening with friends was made even more special with great service, outstanding food and an ambiance that had you second guessing where you were . .the streets of Barcelona, perhaps?

All in all a great choice for a great night out!",2013-07-14 15:06:38

I'd been wanting to go to this place for awhile now.   I've read some reviews about how this place reminds them of a Subway and I can see why.  While Subway focuses on the sandwich, this place offers soups, salads, and sandwiches, which is ok.  (Note: Before I go to a restaurant, I usually look at the menu so I know what I'm going to order when I get to the place.  I was disappointed to see that for the CYO Salad, while they had a decent variety of dressings/lettuces/toppings/etc. to choose from, they were pretty limiting to how many toppings you can choose!  What about those people who wants lots of vegetable toppings and not just 4?) Regardless, I decided to try it out tonight.  I have to admit that I'm not terribly happy with my first time here.  Having had nursed an upset stomach for the past few days, I decided to go with a vegetable soup with a clear broth and the vegetarian sandwich.  The soup was pretty salty.  That's about all I can say about it.  The sandwich wasn't too bad, but I wasn't too impressed with it. For the portion amount, I feel like both was a bit overpriced.

31 Kitchen is mostly a place to indulge in sweets!  But like most bubble tea joints, it seeks to diversify in to the savory side of things so that they can still attract customers during regular meal times.

The ominous glow of green inside the restaurant reminds me of a poor TVB portrayal of what hell looks like.  The décor is simple, but overall a clean presentation.

This place is like a Demetres, Destiny Tea Cafe & Hung Fook Tong all rolled in to one.  The only thing we missed was the lack of cakes on their menu.

We opted for the House Special Milk Pudding ($4.95) and the Black Sesame Pudding ($4.95).  Of the two, the black sesame definitely had more flavour with coconut milk providing a rich and creamy texture.  The milk pudding had very subtle flavours and was sprinkled with some crumbled wafers.  Both were refreshing.

The Mango Pudding ($4.95) came in its usual heart-shaped molded form (which you will have seen frequently at dim sum restaurants) topped with evaporated milk.  To their credit, this was not just all powdered flavouring + gelatin, but had actual chunks of mango in it.

The Strawberry + Blueberry Crepe with Ice Cream ($8.95) was pretty standard.

The Chinese have many ""old wives tales"" when it comes to beauty secrets.  Cue papaya, which is rumoured to enhance the size of your breasts (though I think I'm way past puberty for that to have any effect) and egg whites which is supposed to make your skin smooth.  With those promises, the Steamed Whole Papaya + Milk Pudding ($7.95) is a staple in most Chinese dessert places with variations including egg white or egg custard in place of milk pudding.  The use of smaller, individual-sized papayas does away with the usual bitterness that is found in larger papayas and the milk pudding is steamed to a nice and creamy custard consistency.  Beauty scams aside, I always enjoy this dish.

V E R D I C T

The service at 31 Kitchen is stellar.  You are served cups of hot Chrysanthemum tea and we got refills frequently.  We didn't have to do a monkey dance to get the attention of the staff.

The food and drinks is pretty standard of your usual bubble tea or dessert shop.  I think I have found my newest spot for my weekly catch-up session with my girl Andrea.  Thank God we don't ever have to go back to Go For Tea or Destiny.  The damage at the end of the day was $11 per person including tax and tip. CASH ONLY.",2012-05-29 15:55:15

I had high hopes for our dinner here (all you can eat meat - who wouldn't?) but while walking out of the restaurant after our party of 6 finished dinner, we all had the same sentiments...meh....waste of money...

Having never been to Copacabana before, we relied on the instruction of our server, who sent us to the salad buffet first, before any of the meat came. We brought our plates back to the table, and about 30 minutes after chowing down on salad the meat started to come. It almost seemed as if they were waiting for us to fill up on salads so we would be full by the time the meat came. 

The meat then came in HORDES....all at once! - but this was short lived. The servers with skewers of meat were at our table one after another, with no time to eat the piece already on our plates. They also failed to describe the meat they had (super loud in there and when asked to repeat they just ignored - they need to have signs or something..). After we told a few of them to come back in a bit so we could tackle the meat already on our plates they completely ignored our table for the remainder of the night, even when summoned. 

We also asked four different staff for more salmon (the one hit of the night + the grilled pineapple) and all said sure! no problem! ....and then it never came -____-'

The meat was super super salty and I have a feeling its intentional as they keep coming with bottles of water for the table - maybe hoping you will keep chugging and get filled up?

Basically the night was rushed, loud, poor service, salty meat, and with tax/tip/no drinks came to $45 per person (it was sumerlicious mind you, so it's probably even more expensive on normal days). For that price we could have gone to the Keg and had a great slab of steak with proper sides and better service. 

Save your money.

Would I return? - No. 
Parking? - Street parking on side street and on Yonge, Green P's around, Eglinton subway station right beside
Value for $? - Not great
Space? - Medium sized/limited waiting area (they will take your number and text you when the table is ready). Inside is pretty big. 
Ventilation? - So so (aka you will smell a bit like food after)
Service? - Poor",2015-07-28 14:41:55

My husband and I came in for lunch. We were immediately served chips and two kinds of salsa; spicy red and a mild green. I only had a small taste of the red because I'm a wimp, it had quite a kick. The green was very fresh tasting and really good. I decided on the chicken noodle soup, shared guacamole, and my husband had the torta. 

The chicken noodle soup was like a Mexican version of Pho. It was a big bowl of chicken broth with a generous amount of rice noodles and chunks of chicken. Fresh mint, basil, cilantro, bean sprouts and lime were served on the side. The broth combined with the fresh ingredients made for a very good meal. 

The guacamole was very fresh, similar to Gallo Blanco with hints of citrus in it, it tasted great. 

I only had a bite of my husbands torta, but the flavor was fantastic! The rice on the side was much different and had lots of fresh vegetables like squash and kale.

Oh and they serve passion fruit iced tea, which I love!

Service was very good too, they explained the menu and also warned me about how spicy the sauce for my soup was before dumping it into my whole bowl. I like being able to adjust the spice in my meals because I'm such a wimp when it comes to spice. I will definitely return to Otro Cafe.",2013-04-10 21:20:43

This place is very close to our homes; in the Amall strip mall on the corner of Sahara and Maryland Parkway. And, got great reviews on yelp too. (That is always encouraging).

Today was our time to come here- it's hump day. It was empty until we walked through the door. We were walk-ins. Then another customer walks in. After that a couple, more walk-ins, come in. They leave but are advised to come back in an hour. And two other customers walk in but are appointments. Dang, this place got very busy in a short amount of time.  

Well it is small but surprisingly nice inside. There are chairs along the wall where the front door is located. At the main desk there is an alter & Buddha statue. There are 4 pedicure stations. The TV was on along with some upbeat music (old school R & B). There were three technicians, two female and one male.

It was a nice experience. We each chose a nail color. I went straight to the OPI colors (10 rows, are you serious?! Heck ya!) I got a nice deep burgundy shade while my mom opted for a bronze copper tone and not OPI brand. We each started off with pedicures. The water was almost hot and the massage chair was on. I like it very much (ok, maybe not the hot part). I've had a stressful week at work so far, very busy at home, so it was a nice change of pace for me. Plus, I don't often get to day spas, either. Anyway, one lady worked on my feet. Another lady worked on my nails. I loved the attention to detail, from both of the ladies. I have only gotten this done twice in my life so yes, this was a treat. (My mom said the man who worked on her feet was very gentle. I noticed him always checking in with my mom and he smiled a lot too.)

From the location ( close to the Mustard Seed) and the bland front of the strip mall, I wasn't expecting to walk into the clean and busy it turned out to be. The man who greeted us at the front door seemed like he didn't usually do that job, so he his half acknowledgment to my friend and I was followed by us being seated by a friendlier lady who was also a server there.
The menu isn't huge but has a variety of staples seen in Jewish delis: pickles, latkes, challah etc. 
I chose the latkes to start and them the Chicken Club. The latkes were served with thick sour cream and were thin, crispy and delicious. They offered a sample of their chicken liver with bagels chips. It looked like cat food and tasted organ-y ( that even a word?) but I ate it all. Would I ever eat it if it wasn't given toe for free? No, but it was nice of them to offer the patrons there something different to try. My gigantic sandwich came on an amazing onion bun, which was soft and buttery. The chicken was tender, and the vegetables fresh. It was served with pancetta, which I couldn't taste, but that didn't bother me. On the side was potato salad and slaw. Both awesome, the slaw not being too tart or bitter. My friend had the bagel with lox and capers, served with a generous portion of fruit salad. He lets have a bite. The salmon was nice and thin, the capers not too salty and the bagel was also thinner and had a slightly sweet taste to it.

Due to the multiple requests of my partner, we decided to try it out again to see if there is any improvement made.

We had an appetizer, a dish of vegetables, and an order of seafood dumplings. The taste of the appetizer was a bit plain so we asked the server to add more spice to enhance the flavour. Overall, it tastes pretty refreshing in the summertime because of the mix of the cucumber and parsley. The dish of assorted vegetables was very favourable. The potato and eggplants were well cooked, so soft and easy to chew. The sauce was well permeated through each slice of vegetables. Last but not the least, the dumplings were better. The stuffing was made by shrimps. It at last tastes fresh. The skin was still thick but was more softener than before.

The area is nice for corporate or private events. The lobby area is large and leaves a fair bit of space for mingling, coat check etc. Our event was held inside the Palomino room  which is large and quite spacious.

The serving staff were quite professional and ensured water glasses were filled, plates were cleared in a timely fashion etc. They weren't overly friendly but they got the job done.

The food was very creative and flavourful - I was surprised at the plating and flavour combos. As with most banquets of a large size, it wasn't overly hot but it tasted good. The beef was a little tough and we could have used better knives but again, I appreciate how hard it is to serve so many people at once and have everything be perfect for every diner.

The spa and salon are located on the 14th floor. Use the elevators right by the lobby. When you walk in, it looks like a store more than a salon or spa.

After checking in for my aroma mani and pedi, I was given an iPad with a special app. It led me through a series of questions, which were used to determine my own special and unique oil blend for the aromatherapy aspect. I thought that was quite neat.

My nail specialist was incredible. Super friendly and nice. And as she led me back to the nail area, she gave me a tour of the salon and told me about all of their offerings. She didn't try to sell me on anything - it was a great informational tour, which I really appreciated.

The pedicure chairs were pure bliss. Hands-down the best massage chairs in Vegas. It was just the right amount of pressure and stuff going on. It felt divine. I could've sat in that chair all day.

And the massage of my feet, legs, hands, and arms was the best I've ever experienced. I also liked the fact that their water wasn't just a small bottle of water (like you get just about everywhere else), but an actual glass of cucumber and lime water. And my nail specialist filled me in on all of the spa amenities and let me know that I had free use of the spa for the rest of the day (while this is typical, it was not mentioned when I booked the appointment).

After finishing up my mani and pedi, she personally led me into the spa area and gave me a tour. Overall, she did a really fantastic job and was just great.

The spa itself was a bit underwhelming. It was very nicely done and the staff were great. But I was just expecting more. It was on the small side. All in the same main room were a decent-sized pool with ""monsoon"" rain shower, steam room, cool mist room, and sauna. I liked that they had a cool mist room - that's not something I've seen before.

They also had the standard shower area, locker area, and ""get ready"" area. I was impressed with the ""get ready"" area in terms of the quality of products they had. Far too many of the high-end spas have had Aqua Net and Suave. But here, it was ceramic ion dryers, salon brand hairsprays, etc. But they also didn't have razors, toothbrushes, etc. like I've seen at other spas.

The downsides were the slow and mumbling receptionist, the small spa with few amenities, and that they forgot to give me the locals discount (though, they did correct it later).

It is just like how I'd imagine a coffee shop, with the vibe, kind of akward build, and character that so many coffee shops lack these days (ahem cough cough Starbuckscough!). It felt strange to be in because I am so use to the ""other guys"" set-up that I've been going to for years, but I liked it...it left me wanting other experiences there. The latte I had was pretty good, hand made with care and time invested, instead of just thrown together quickly by a barista in a green apron. The 2 guys behind the counter were nice, one welcoming me back for a future visit. I thought it was cool they have a side-bar where they serve a couple different micro-brews and wine, something at least I've never seen in a coffee shop. Just an interesting place all together. I wish I could've spent some more time there but I enjoyed my brief visit. As of now, they have a new customer!

I believe it was like $13 or 14.99. My salad was small, and oddly enough it came with a freakin muffin? Not to mention the muffin was the BEST thing i tasted in there....sad,but true, the blackened chicken was the smallest little diced cubed up chicken pieces i have EVER seen, it didn't even taste as if it was blackened. The greens were wilted, and usually a $12 salad anywhere ya go is a good salad with a nice pieces of chicken cutlet, and our server was trying her  best, but came off as annoying to us unfortunately. We also ordered the appetizer of the crab fritters, i think like $5.99- and it was not great, the crab tasted old....This came off as one of those restaurants that want merely nothing but your money, the food isn't authentic whatsoever and the servers look as if they could care less..I will never be coming back to this place",2012-03-30 06:18:37

The meat was on today. There was sirloin slices that were quite tender. Tongue is always pretty good. I appreciate that they always have the thin sliced radish which I use for wrapping meat and lightens up the taste. 

It's not something I can do often but I enjoy it when I do splurge on a meatfest.

Silly us, we forgot to make reservations. No worries as the restaurant was almost empty (more people filed in as we were eating). A few minutes after we were seated, our waitress came over to take our drink order. We casually eyed up the buffet in the back of the room and asked our server what was on it. Fat kids paradise, they should have called it. Bacon, eggs, potatoes, ribs, pepper steak, mac and cheese, lasagna, french toast casserole, grits, dessert and a salad if you were looking for something green. Yep. Who could pass up that spread? I eagerly dug in and tried just about all of it. Our server also brought over their homemade biscuits and cornbread muffins. Delic! My favorite part of the buffet was the buffalo mac and cheese. Creamy, smooth and a hint of spice. All in all, a great ladies brunch. My only criticism is that our server took an extremely long time to bring our drinks (or at least it felt that way as we all tried not to stare at the buffet).

My mother-in-law ordered the shaved prime rib and my father-in-law ordered the smoked turkey. About 10 minutes later, our sandwiches were delivered to our table in a brown paper bag. They were large and hot.

I unfolded my Cubano and it smelled good as the steam arose from it. I noticed mustard all over it, but I still had high hopes. My first bite was heavenly. The bread was perfect, the meat was hot, moist, and delicious. I immediately noticed the care and quality of the ingredients, especially the meat. The sandwich was oh so flavorful. I loved it.

This is the best Cubano I've ever had.  Sorry, Isla del Puerto Rico, you were just demoted. I have a new lover and her name is Herbntwine!  My in-laws really liked their sandwiches too.  They didn't want to put them down.

Maybe I had over expected the quality and taste of the food... since Yu Seafood presented themselves as this 'luxurious' and 'high class' restaurant but their dim sum did not meet this standard. They have limited dim sum - only one column (half side) of the sheet was dim sum and the other side was dessert, fried rice/noodles and entrees (like rack of lambs). 

Here are things I DIDN'T ENJOY: 
- Lobster seafood steam bun (L): This was extremely overpriced for 3 steam buns since the filling inside hardly had any lobster meat or even taste to it. 
- Fresh fruit napoleon (L): It looked pretty, and it came in approximately 3 layers of puff pastry with cream, mini strawberries and sliced kiwi. However, the puff pastry was STALE which is the biggest turnover for this type of dessert (and I even wondered if it was fresh... perhaps a day old?). 
- Scallops, egg white, king oyster fried noodles ($18): This is the worst Chinese fried noodles I've ever had! Although the scallops were a good/decent size, it didn't taste fresh with an almost frozen after taste.The noodles have absolutely NO TASTE and should be avoided. It definitely did not match the high price they charged. 

Here are things I ENJOYED: 
- Special BBQ pork bun (M): This was essentially 3 mini pineapple buns with BBQ pork inside. Overall, the bread was very soft, and it was very unique. 
- Steam pork ribs with pumpkin (M): Pork ribs was plentiful! They definitely did not cheap out on the portion, and every pork rib had soft meat. So there weren't pieces that were just bone or fat. 

As for service, for my most recent experience, the server did not engage us or even respond to us. When we asked for toothpicks for a table of 5, he gave us only 2 packets of toothpicks. Furthermore, when we ordered the big plate of fried noodles, the servers did not give us bowls to share which is very uncommon for Chinese restaurants. I tried getting someone but no one came, and in the end, I had to get up myself to grab bowls they had on the side.

I took the family to dinner a couple nights ago and used their new Mobil app to order.  The claim to fame for the app is to ""pass the line"".  

So I get there and walk to the pick up area. I then stand there waiting while the cashiers take the orders of the people who are in line and tell me they will be with me momentarily.  So I wait. One they clear out the line of the customers who were in line, they greet me. I tell them I'm there to pick up. 

I wait...and I wait. 

As I stand there waiting I am watching food go out the side door to the customers who had walked in at the same time and after me. 

Once those customers begin eating. Shortly after another mobile app customer comes in and gets her order quickly. She leave the restaurant and come right back in minutes later explaining her order was wrong. The employee collects the food they had given her and says, ""oh it this customers food"".  She then takes the kids meals from the lady and hands them to me. I tell the employee I don't want that food as it had left the restaurant and then came back. She rolled her eyes and scratched her two toned skunk hair. After trying to reason with her that I didn't want to give the food to my kids, she throws the bags in the trash and gets another employee working on the order, while she begins messing around on Facebook swiping through photos and showing anther employee at that manager station. 

I finally get my order after 35 minutes of waiting and the customers who had came in behind me are walking out with full stomachs. 

Won't use the app again and it frustrates me the lack of service here because that's what chick fila is all about. It's too bad because I love those brand and their food. Sad. 

Update:

I took the wife to breakfast and out bagel sandwich was burnt.  Reached out to them on Yelp by messaging the business. But they never responded. I called, left my name.  No call back. So now I'll share with you the horrible sandwiches we had.  This is the message I left:

We have never tried your breakfast. So with your message addressing our previously experience, we thought we would give you guys another chance. I took my wife out for breakfast this morning and one of the items we ordered was the bagel sandwich. To our displeasure, the bagel was burnt. Couldn't enjoy it. I have never tried this sandwich. So if this is how it's supposed to be, I apologize and disregard my complaint.

One of her customers came and raved about the pizza at Mangia and Bevi - a very cool looking joint on the east side (right across from the Toronto Sun building) on King Street East ... and I was excited to try something different. 

We had a simple lunch:  I had the Salata Pizza, pretty nice with ricotta, black olives, roasted tomatoes and arugula and my girlfriend had the Giudaica, which was excellent! It had percorino, artichokes, mozzerella and mint. One of the nicest combinations I have tried. We shared both pizzas and unanimously declared the Giudaica the champ!

If they had a wood-burning oven, it would put their pizza over the top!

I also love that they serve hot antipasto with the pizzas!

The wine was basic, but the portions were quite generous for the price.
Good simple quaffing wine. I had a really nice glass of Nero D'Avola for eight bucks!

Service was really nice and the everyone appeared to be very down-to-earth.

We went last night prior to fright dome and all I can say is that I make better food at home! That is not good! 
We ordered a large 6 to 8 person appetizer platter that was supposed to be loaded with nachos, quesadillas, a spinach dip with chips, mozzarella sticks, barbecue spareribs, and a few other items. The platter came and it was loaded with all of these things, all of which tasted like food that was taken from a package from the freezer that was bought at Albertson's! To add to that,it also tasted like that same food was leftovers from another party. It was disgusting and we only touched 10% of it. The platter cost $40 and we all agreed that we threw $40 down the drain. 
The drinks were average but that is not what we came here. We were literally hungry and we left hungry!

We initially came here on a Wednesday night and it was jam packed inside and out. Little did we know that on our girl's night out we stumbled in at the right time to enjoy Ladies Night. Call it dumb luck. The drinks were delicious and at half price even more delicious. Love how they bring your drink in a cocktail shaker that give you at least two fill in your martini glass. Oh and then there's Industry night on Mondays. Definitely a smaller scene than Wednesday but made for a great outdoor patio party. The dj was on point. 

I have loved every cocktail that I've tried here. My favorites by far are the Chyna Doll and the Summer Fling. Both are sweet, though not too sweet, and flavorful. I've tried my friends cocktails and seriously have yet to try one that I haven't liked.

While I loved the rice, I found the chicken to be too much like Indian tandoori chicken and didn't really differentiate itself.  Don't get me wrong, the meat was pretty flavourful, but I expected something different than Indian tandoori chicken.  

Also, the salad was limited as it was just a few leaves of lettuce and some diced tomatoes on top.  I was expecting a bigger salad, with sliced tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce.  The naan was not bad.  

So while I think this place will do in a crunch for Afghan food and that the rice is delicious, I think Pamier Kabob (about 10-15 minutes north in Brampton) is better as they

a) Have a tandoori chicken special, which also includes a beef skewer
b) Bigger salad
c) but rice isn't as good as Watan.

As soon as we sat down we were served chips and salsa then our waiter came to our table and took our drink orders.

I have three standards when it comes to judging Mexican restaurants beans, rice and salsa. These three items will tell you whether or not you are in a quality Mexican restaurant. Thankfully, all three passed my test. 

(1) The salsa- The salsa here is to die for. WARNING: The chips & salsa here is addicting. I could make a meal out of their salsa and chips they were so awesome. The chips were crispy, tasty served hot and so fresh. Their salsa adds a zing to anything you put it on. The best part is they are FREE with an entrée .
(2) Beans- the beans was cooked to perfection. They were very tasteful.
(3) Rice - was cooked perfectly. They tasted homemade. 

All ten people got something different. By the silence during dinner they all enjoyed their meals. Afterwards everyone commented how they ate to much chis and salsa because they were so good and how delicious everything was.

For my entrée I went against my usual instincts and ordered something new and different. I got the  Carne Macha (Shredded beef sautéed with fresh tomatoes, onions, green bell peppers, and a special seasoning. Served with guacamole, rice, beans and choice of corn or flour tortillas). The Macha beef was overdone, dried out and looked burnt. I ate everything except the beef. Thank goodness I had chips & salsa to fill me up. I told our waiter how disappointed I was with the beef and pointed out I ate everything else. He offered to get me something different. I declined because everyone else was just finishing their meals. Later he took the meal off the bill.

The atmosphere is very festive and vibrant. The only thing keeping me from granting a 4 star rating is my meal was not to my liking. If my meal was expectable / enjoyable I would have given it a rating of 4. 

FOOD: The portions were ample so if you're a big eater you'll be pleased. They use fresh ingredients and their entrees look very inviting. Salsa and chips (complementary) is praiseworthy. Flavorfully spiced with a nice consistency, I wanted to take home a 5 gallon bucket of this stuff. The rice here is perfect!  AMBIANCE: The restaurant is really interesting to look at. You can tell that the owners take great pride in the restaurant.  They took the time to nicely decorate the restaurant although the décor is what you'd expect in a Mexican restaurant.  PRICE: Average for a quality Mexican restaurant. SERVICE: Our waiter and his helper were both very friendly attentive and efficient . CONCLUSION: characteristic décor. The atmosphere is great. Portions are big.  I enjoyed this place -- food, price, service, atmosphere -- everything you'd want.  Highly recommended  RETURN  FACTOR: 100%.

And I didn't die after so I'm guessing they were telling the truth ;) 
The Cajun wings had a dry rub and they were just okay. However, this could have just been because beside the awesomeness of the honey garlic and garlic parmesan, anything else would fall flat. I didn't try the other wings bc I'm not a fan of a burning mouth but I'm told they were good.
The service was pretty fast. The guy shouted the number of wings we wanted to the kitchen before he even took down the types in order to get them started. Definitely took way less time than your average wing place in discount night. Under 15 mins. We also ordered fries. They were just okay. Nothing special but good enough.

We arrive on time and are seated immediately. Nice.

We order some drinks and some wings for an appetizer. Wings were a little crispy, I am not sure if that was the intent. OK, only OK.

The burgers were good, cooked medium and a good size. But it's $5 extra for fries. Burgers , in my opinion, should be served with fries NOT soggy potato chips. I believe it is complete gouging to charge 50% of the burger price for the fries.

Smaller son had kids chicken fingers and fries and it was ok but the portion was small.

Everything so clean and in order, even the washroom is immaculately spotless!

Order at the counter with the option of eating in or takeout. We decided to share 2 entrees which both comes with a choice of soup or salad.

Koobideh Kebob ($6.99)
- cooked to order, fresh of the grill taste
- Mixture of grounded lamb and beef, a little gamey for my taste. The meat though is moist 

Lamb Shank ($9.99)
- Surprisingly tender and well flavoured! 
- Rice on the side is mixed with rosemary and fava beans

Portion is quite decent at this price point. We left happy and fulfilled!

Love how our meals are served on real plates and cutlery! I just can't stand eating from Styrofoam!

Definitely would be back again for their stew! Fesenjan ($8.99) and Ghormeh Sabzi ($6.99) which comes with rice and soup/salad, sound delicious!",2013-05-08 03:55:07

I used to live right down the street from Harris Grill, so I would come here often. I like the sangria, but since I only come for happy hour these days, I generally just stick with the $3 cosmopolitans. I've had a few different dishes for dinner and they're OK. I remember going ape over the macaroni and cheese a couple of years ago, but I had a bite of a friend's macaroni and cheese on July 4 and was completely underwhelmed. Maybe my macaroni and cheese tastes have evolved, or maybe the quality has just gone down. 

My typical happy hour snacks are hummus with pita and the pierogies. I like the hummus - nothing bad to say. I actually love the hummus. I like texture and there are chunks of whole chickpea. I also like that Harris Grill lets me pick whether I want pita, pita chips, and/or vegetable sticks. The pierogies, to me, are hit or miss. I've had them probably three times and once they were so cooked that they were crunchy and dead, once they were perfect - lightly panfried but still softish, and the other time they were somewhere in between. They always taste like butter though. Seriously. Paula Deen would love these pierogies. 

My favorite thing that I've ever had at Harris Grill is the deep dish cookie with the ice cream on top. I dream about that thing, but since I am not actively trying to gain 400 lbs, I stick to eating it once every 6 months or so. 

The menu is... cute, if you like cutesy menus. The outdoor seating is great on a warm summer evening.",2013-08-04 05:48:18

What we liked:
-Central to downtown Scottsdale
-Very beautifuly lobby and relaxing pool/outdoor area
-Nice rooms and bathrooms
-Free wine hour from 5-6
-Free upgrade to a nicer room
What can be improved:
-If you sit in the area where the pool with the sandy beach is, there is virtually no pool side service unless you go and find a person to serve you.  
-There was a really loud party until 2am in the building next to us and security did not stop the drunken yelling
-The corner rooms near the gate are the loudest.  Everytime some opened the gate or got ice, we heard it clearly.

The most impressive entree was my dad's skate wing special, but my soup/salad, mom's steak frites, and my husband's scallops all left us a bit disappointed. For me, Georges jumped from a Yelp 2 to a Yelp 3 based solely on the cheese platter (tres bien!) and the charcutrerie board, particularly the foie gras.  We have been eating foie gras regularly for decades and we've had some of the best that NYC, California, Chicago, and several parts of Western Europe and Canada have to offer. That being said, our most memorable foie gras experience was at Racine's in Montreal (sadly, no longer open) when we had raw foie gras which was literally the Nectar of the Gods. We have never experienced foie gras of that caliber before or since, until now. Georges gave us a tiny sliver of foie gras that was identical to what we had in Canada and I was just giddy over it. We will be back to Georges for the foie gras alone and next time will give their raw bar a go. I'm game for the $1 oyster Thursdays and am hoping that they are large and ultra fresh. A good oyster and foie gras joint close to home would be a slam dunk, even if we're not 100% in love w/ the entrees.",2016-04-23 19:45:53

I first found out about the Velveteen Rabbit when I was reading reviews for a similar spot ""The Laundry Room"" by Yelpers saying this bar (The Rabbit) was much better. So I was curious and on a mission! With my love in toe we decided to check this spot out and it didn't disappoint!

Outside the parking lot there is an  artistic indie wall mural that is a really cool photo opportunity for anyone who appreciates art. The street marker for the bar is a rabbit silhouette, adding to the mystique.

Inside is a generous seating plan with bar seating and Victorian themed furniture for group seating (my favorite part!). There is a DJ booth for live music that begins at 10pm. On an accent wall by the booth is a blank space used for 3D digital projections. Adding a moving artistic element to the space.

The house cocktails are offered on a paper pamphlet with art stories and quotes on various pages. Very fun!

The house signiture cocktail list is comprised of a summer selection mix. Now i personally love sweet and fruity cocktails, so under that bias lens (Lol) there is one drink that stands out as delicious and a desert treat: The Breakfast Club. Amazing flavor! Outside of my bias flavor preference lense, the signiture cocktail list offers crisp clean and tart varieties. 

This is definitely a better option of creative space than the Laundry Room.

I came in knowing exactly what I wanted: a blue tooth keyboard to use with an iPhone. I thought this should be a simple purchase, but I underestimated the lack of competence of the Best Buy staff.

Things started well enough. I walked in, asked for Blue Tooth keyboards and was directed to a certain section of the store. In this section, computer keyboards greeted me, and although some were wireless, it wasn't what I had asked for. I proceeded to search around for several minutes on my own, but then decided to heed the voice of my husband in my head and ask for help. 

Dramatic interpretation of events that followed.
 
""Hi, I am looking for a Blue Tooth keyboard to use with an iPhone.""

Best Busy Associate: ""I don't think they make those.""

""Yes, they do. I have owned one in the past.""

Best Buy Associate: ""Why would you want a keyboard with your iPhone? The screen is so small.""

""I want one. I know they exist. Can you just tell me whether or not you have them?""

Best Buy Associate: ""Um... let me get on the computer and do some searches. What is it exactly you need again?"" 
 
[Aimless searching on computer commences.]

Best Buy Associate: ""Maybe he can help you?"" [points to someone else]

""Can you help me find a Blue Tooth keyboard?""

[Blank stare from second associate. Aimless computer search continues. I just walk away.]

I eventually find the best option for what I need, which is really the only option they carried. My previous keyboard, which was better, came from Radio Shack.

It's been about nine years since my last visit here and now I remember why it's taken me this long to go back. The last time I was here I remember it being so ghetto kinda like a cafeteria setting almost and now it looks more like a food court setting you'd see at a mall. My little beef with the seating arrangement is that you are so close to other people that it kinda ruins your meal a little. For one I'm not one to ease drop on someone elses conversation or do I like hearing other peoples conversation but it's impossible not to ignore it b/c you are that damn close to other people. 

Besides the seating arrangement the interior looked very nice and clean. The bar area adds a nice touch to it with sports, mostly soccer, playing on the screens. I wanna come back here just to see what it is like during the World Cup! I betcha this place would be crazy during that time. 

The one item that stands out here is the BBQ chicken. The chicken is very well done, cooked properly and the flavour was nice. But when you add that hot sauce that they supply it makes the chicken so much sweeter. The white meat on the chicken was very good not dry at all like almost every other place I've been to. The one item not to get is the sausage. Presentation wise it's served on a pig that's on fire, very wonderful site to see where it gets everyones attention. There is alot of meat in that sausage but the flavour wasn't the greatest and it was very dry that we didn't even finish half of it. 

I don't know when the next time I'll come back here maybe another 9 years but who knows if I happen to be craving Portuguese chicken and I happen to be around the area I'll grab some for take out.

Apple Crunchy Muffin (score 3/5)
It looks very good by its appearance and really attracts me to choose it. I really love the apple meat that I could eat from the muffin, it may because I love apples, but I find it too sweet. I couldn't finish eating the whole muffin due to it is too sweet, not because I am full.

Cheese, Bacon and Egg Sandwich (score 3/5)

We arrived at about 7:30 on a Friday night, and I was surprised at how very small this place is. There are about 10 - 15 tables and a bar area, and unfortunately we got there just as the last table was snapped up. Luckily there were 2 spots left at the bar, and we were able to get a drink while we waited. A nice surprise occured when our would-be waitress approached us and asked if we'd like to order before we got our table, as the food would arrive as soon as we were seated. Nice one. My stomach at this point was practically jumping out of my throat, so speed was key.

Once seated (about a 20 minute wait at the bar), our food arrived approximately 5 minutes later. I ordered the Tre Carne pizza, with a ton o' meat and banana peppers, onions and tomatoes. The ground beef was fantastic, really flavourful. The pizza itself had a nice thin crust and a thin but balanced layer of sauce and cheese. I personally am not a fan of thick crust or too much sauce - less is more, so this suit me perfectly.

All in all my pizza craving was asauged, and the leftovers (and unless you are ready to eat a small horse, there will be leftovers) tasted even better warmed and with a little hot sauce the next day. The place itself is a little small, so if there are no bar seats I'd move along, as the wait isn't worth it if you're standing around for 20 minutes.",2011-03-23 19:30:09

I find all of their menu options to be just slightly over the price I'm willing to pay for Mexican food, no matter how ""modern"" it claims to be. The ""taquitos"" (actually just small tacos) platters run around about $14-$16 for 5 small tacos, which seems like a pretty good deal, however I found the amount of protein you get in the portion to be quite small for 5 tacos, and they overly rely on pickled options and sauces to supplement the portion sizes.  

Their margaritas are similar to Barrio's in my opinion, quite sweet and flavored with a thick juicy pulp. I think a lot of people like these type of margaritas, but I prefer something a little less sweet and a little more tart/sour. 

I will say that the chips and guacamole were fabulous, but at the same time it's a little disappointing when after spending $60 for a meal for two, the best thing is the chips and guacamole. I also do want to point out that our server was awesome at making recommendations and I had no complaints about service, my complaint lies only in my unwillingness to pay such a high price for Mexican when there are so many other places I can find that do it cheaper and dare I say, better.

The Benny:

I liked everything but my party did complain that the food came out warm and wasn't hot enough. This didn't bother me since it complemented my cold papaya salad well.

I know two people that work here, and they are really nice. Add one star for that lol. The second star is for the nifty little nail salon they have inside. The third star is for cleanliness and safety.

I kept it simple and grabbed a small burrito with spicy pulled pork for about $8. They call it small, but as is often the case with a burrito, they'll fit a lot of love into those pita walls. Like any self respecting man, I said yes to all of the toppings, which includes: rice, tomatoes, lettuce, green onion, refried beans, cilantro cheese, green pepper, and guacamole jalapeños. It's generally hard to find a ""bad"" burrito so my expectations were rather neutral, but God damn did I like this burrito. Sure the ingredients appeared relatively fresh and the burrito was filling, but the superb refried beans, the spicy pulled pork, and the extra bit of hot sauce took me to a special place. Fair warning: they do not mess around with spicy here. If you ask for hot sauce, they'll give you Mexican attitude hot sauce, not North American tingle-your-tongue hot sauce. Fight through it though and appreciate a dynamite burrito.

HERE IS HOW YOU PROPERLY GREET AND ASSIST A CUSTOMER: ""Hello, my name is __________. How may I assist you today?""

I dropped by T-Mobile during my lunch break as a ten-year AT&T customer hoping to make the big switch. They had this huge promo going on ""switch from a carrier and get a free iPhone 7 (when you trade in your current iPhone)"". Upon every transaction, sales associates should 1) assume customers are there for the promo or 2) at least talk about the promo.

Imelda assisted me without proper above-said greeting, so she missed the whole point of why I was there and our time including a lot of backtracking and waste. I tell her I want to make the big switch, so she proceeds to activate a new line, makes me pay for a $25 SIM card, then looks at me - ""So you already have a phone for this SIM card?"" ""No, I wanted to do the free iPhone promo."" ""Oh. I saw you had two phones so I just assumed you already had a phone for me. If I knew you wanted to do the promo, I wouldn't have charged you $25 because under the promo, activating a line is free."" Huh?? Maybe if you fully questioned my needs without jumping the gun...

She then had to void the $25 transaction which for some reason she was reluctant to do. Her whole manner was rushed and lacked genuine concern when explaining things to me. When going over details of the promo, she rambled in her jargon that only phone courier sales associates who have to talk about it 100x a day would understand. She sees I do not get it, emits an exasperated sigh, then condescendingly writes on a sticky note what my options are. I have questions, and she responds to them in a nope-you-can't-do-that tone.

Ugh, the whole ordeal was so stupid. I made up in my mind that I wanted to switch from AT&T to T-Mobile and she changed that buying power in an instant. I stopped the transaction saying I'd think about my options and return after work. She said she's working there until 8pm. Hell no was I returning to her. I took my business to their Silverado location where THEIR T-Mobile associates absolutely redeemed their company's name and went above and beyond for me.

Wow, this location is SMALL!  My first taste of Four Peaks was at the cavernous Tempe location, which I found to be too large, too loud, and too busy for my taste (plus there's not enough parking spaces!).  This one in Scottsdale is more to my liking.  Intimate and not too dark inside (outside, however, I couldn't tell if there was patio seating since it was so dark), open sight lines from most points in the restaurant, the women's restroom looked and smelled clean, AND parking isn't a problem.

Came in to order a pint of peach ale, knowing that I can't buy it at stores.*  I inquired about the possibility of taking some home and was told that I may purchase a growler.**  A pint costs around $4, but during happy hours costs $3.25 (pitchers $14/$12).  Reverse happy hour starts at 10p.  Please note that their register's clock runs slow, so you may have to wait a few minutes longer before you can start getting happy.***

FYI, if you've misplaced your driver license, you may use a passport to get past the I.D. checker at the door.

*Whole Foods sells growlers now, and most keep peach ale on stock.

**Growlers are pressurized receptacles that hold 64 oz. of whatever beverage you want to take with you.  A new growler costs $14 and can be refilled for $10.  It is recommended that people finish the 64 oz. within 24 hours of opening, but I was told that the beverage will stay fresh for longer than that.  BTW, peach ale is offered for takeout AND isn't a seasonal variety like I thought it was.  FYI, I didn't enjoy the ale here as much, since it wasn't ice-cold, like the one I had at Tempe's Lucky Break.  I'll have to remember to ask for a frosted glass, if it's available.

So I recommend it for a business outing, which gets everyone excited. Drinks are fine, orders are taken and the guacamole begins to get prepared table side. As soon as we begin to dive into the guac, the soup arrives. One of our guests was in the restroom, and his soup was served while he was away. BAD, BAD waiter. Hot, cold, warm dish... whatever, you do not serve an empty seat. 

While enjoying our soup, entrees come out and were placed right next to our arms on sizzling hot plates. No one was even half way through their soup. I was furious and felt obligated to quickly shovel my soup so I could bring the dinner plate to my front and eat.

Bamboo - cocktail off the main menu with melon liqueur and 1.5 oz alcohol. Delicious and light, but not much in terms of booze.
Chicken Karaage - fried chicken is always a keeper - juicy inside, crispy outside
Beef udon - we needed some carbs too - was ok, but not the highlight
Salmon and 7 friends - beautifully displayed, server mixes up the dish and eat with seaweed. Delicious and salmon was so fresh.
Black cod sushi - beautifully served, and yummy. Love the big portions
Grilled black cod - this came last and was sizzling off the plate. Sweet and delicate, HIGHLIGHT!
Scallop sashimi - off the daily menu. Super duper fresh, came with wasabi and soy sauce.
Baked brie - crispy and melty brie. Was a lot less interesting after it cooled down, though...so eat quickly.

I have been looking for some place like this for a while! Everything on the menu is purchased from local farmers and businesses. The restaurant is small and intimate and that makes it well worth the wait - You can actually hear yourself and your companions without having to talk loudly.

 I had the Eggs Benedict with roasted red pepper and avocado - It was to die for! I am not sure what it is with most places in Calgary but they do not know how to make eggs Benedict right; there is usually too much hollandaise sauce, about 1/3 more food on your plate than you really should eat, combined with lame fruit or package-cooked hash browns. Some places even go as far as using a margarine-made crescent: not cool people!

I can without a doubt say The Dairy Lane Cafe makes Calgary's best Eggs Benedict! 

First off portions: You get two half English muffin slices each topped with a medium sized egg, and just the right splash of hollandaise. You get all the flavor and don't feel sick afterwards for consuming 1/4 cup of butter. The fruit it came with (you can also have the standard hash browns) was fresh with a hearty portion. When I finished the meal I was full and pleased.
Next flavor: homemade delicate yet tasty hollandaise, multi-grain freshly baked English muffin, locally sourced free-range eggs, fresh vegetables. The toppings (in my case red pepper + avocado, but also you can choose back bacon + tomato or smoked Salmon) were perfectly cooked and placed appropriately.

Awe yes and the coffee is fresh and a good blend, bottomless with attentive service.

So come check out an amazing breakfast Calgary!",2011-02-13 22:06:33

Mike submitted his work order to my home warranty company. Home warranty company called me and told me that I needed a temperature and pressure modification and a vent modification which would not be covered and would cost me $330.00 out of my own pocket.  My house is fairly new and no modifications should be needed.  Called my handyman and he installed a water heater and the two modifications WERE NOT needed. Complained to AHS who will have someone contact me in 2-3 business days me to offer me some type of financial settlement.  I guess something in the area of what they would have paid AMA.  Maybe not much that's why AMA was trying to get $330.00 more out of me.  Even if it cost me a bit more out of pocket I would rather give the $ to my honest handyman and not to a company who has no business ethics.  All I have to say is with Yelp and my big mouth the word will spread.   My water heater was installed the same day. AMA would not be able to install same day.  Than to top it off Mike the plummer recommended a restoration company to fix the water damage.  He called them on his phone and his friend showed up lickety split.  Wanted $1500.00-$2000.00 to cut holes in to platform and walls and dry out water than a second unknown cost  to be determined when he completes step 1 to repair his cuts and holes.  Paid $325.00 to my handyman for water repair.  They assumed I would use my insurance that has a $1000.00 deductible plus a ding on my homeowners insurance.,2015-07-29 04:13:30

Let's start with the positives. The Caeser salad is hands down one of the best in Toronto. Made fresh at your table. It was a classic dressing with the egg white, anchovies, mustard and garlic.  The garlic bread also was delicious and came out fresh, hot  and tasty. 

I had the rib eye and it arrived at the table warm. It was warm borderline cool. I mean come on guys. Who likes to eat a steak warm?  My guess is that they don't heat their plates in an oven like a Morton's or Ruth Chris. Also the travel time from the kitchen to table could be lengthy due to the size of the place (duh maybe use something to cover the plates). Also when the plates do reach the area of a table it can sit for a few minutes on a tray waiting for a server. The steak was pretty burnt out the outside and the inside was fine. It's a classic case of using to much heat. This IMHO a rookie mistake. I ended up only eating 1/2 because it simply wasn't any good. 


Service was extremely poor. Waiter made several mistakes on the order and had a stuck up attitude. Waiter was not attentive. Near the end of the meal we had to go look for our own milk and brown sugar because our waiter was nowhere to be found. The scary thing was the night we went was quiet. If our service and food was so poor on a slow night, can you even fathom a busy night?

Swans has an exterior that hides the standard bar interior with a nice cozy feeling but has a surprisingly large space.  The waitress there was in good spirits, we were greeted, sat and menued promptly and even had coasters flung at us like miniature frisbees.

Thankfully we were engrossed with funny work stories that we didn't even notice that our drinks were empty and food was served about 30 minutes later.  I think compassion kicks in when you realise that a person is working alone.  ""I haven't had a rush like that in 2 years""... she exclaimed.

I'm certainly glad that Howard Hughes picked up a restaurant that isn't a franchise restaurant. 

CHECK IN OFFER/CHIPS & SALSA: Get that check in offer! Because we all know that we love a good guac thrown in the mix of salsa. Chips & salsa re-mix!!!! In all honesty, it's the green salsa that really out shined the guac. If you're a fan of extra citrus and lots and lots of cilantro. Go green!

OCTOPUS TACO: It came with rice and beans + a side, and the got the ""elote"" type corn. It was soft, tender, and packed with flavor. Of course, if you love that gamey, seafood flavor of an octopus, you'll like this. None of the fixings overpowered the octopus, because the octopus runs the show in this taco. I definitely recommend this if you're looking to be a little adventurous--steering away from the usual al pastors and carne asadas. 

BANDITO HOUSE MICHELADA: Idk if they make their own chili powder for it, but that tajin is LIT! It is a lot spicier. They put two pieces of fried pork short ribs (chicharron style). Take a bite of that chicharron. Then, take a big sip of the Michelada with the Tajin spice and just wait until you feel your taste buds throw a fiesta in your mouth. You're welcome.

TJX (Winners, Marshalls, HomeSense) company has really seemed to have exploded downtown.  In every block, there seemed to be 1 of their stores.  However, I think something is happening where the company is really trying to make distinctions between all their brands.

I used to like coming here, but last night, their upstairs Gourmet Food/Housewares section was a complete disappointment.  It looks as though they're trying to shrink those 2 sections and maybe put them more into HomeSense??  As someone with a retail background, this is just my theory.

Strike 2: The food isn't worth the prices. I'm talking regular prices, not early bird. Small is $2.90, I think, but there are only 4 on the entire menu, and 2 are desserts. Medium is $3.90, if I recall correctly. I mean, the food doesn't suck. It's okay. I've just had significantly better at that price point.

Strike 3: I'm Chinese. I speak Chinese. I can't read it though. I read #41: Braised Vegetarian Chicken (Tofu). I know what that is. I ordered it. I also read #40: King Tofu Roll. I ordered that too. When they came, I didn't realize those were the dishes I'd ordered. I wasn't the only one who ticked things off, so I assumed they weren't my orders until I asked if everything had come, heard the answer was yes, and noticed the dishes I thought I ordered weren't there. I asked the server. She pointed to the two that came. The first looked like a piece of taro, a piece of vegetarian chicken, a large piece of shiitake mushroom, and a piece of ham/sausage wrapped in bean curd sheet. The smallest of all the fillings was the vegetarian chicken. Based on the English, I was expecting an entire dish of vegetarian chicken, and not any of that other stuff. The second dish looked exactly like the first, except it didn't have the vegetarian chicken in it, and it was wrapped in steamed, sliced melon of some sort. There was no tofu. Clearly, neither of the dishes fit the English name. We called over one of the managers and explained our problem. He got super defensive really fast. He didn't begin with an apology. He started angrily explaining that they were a Chinese restaurant and that they could have mistranslated the dishes. He asked whether I understood where he was coming from like I was dumb. He kept saying it was about grammar, etc., and made it sound like it was my fault for saying something about it. After like five minutes of arguing with him, he basically angrily said, ""Well, do you want me to take them off your bill?"" Well, I wanted you to solve the issue in a civil way, but clearly, that didn't happen, so sure. Take them off my bill. I'm still not satisfied. After I said yes, he condescendingly said something along the lines of, ""Thank you for pointing out our problem. Sorry."" 

Side note: We had a server named Crystal who was delightful. She told Grandpa she'd mark that he got 10% off before the food came so he could put his VIP card away and not lose it before the end of our meal. 

Ritzy Palace? With a name like that and prices that supposedly match the high class establishment you're trying to create, if your manager is going to act like a pompous king, he can pay to come here. I won't willingly be coming back.",2017-09-10 01:36:20

I like their take out area with self-serve chopsticks, spoons, etc.

Dish temperature was really good, and the container it came in was soooo cute.  Like a stereotypical ""classic"" Chinese food take out box.

Finally stopped by after their renovations and it looks nice!  They've definitely expanded and they added a ton more seating.  I love that they kept the murals on the walls, cause to be honest, that was the best part of their decor.  Their menu is a little hard to read and that might hold up the line, so guys and ladies of Los Taquitos, if you're reading this,  laminated menus at the start of the line might be a nice touch?

Customer service, once again, wasn't great, but I've lowered my expectations since my last visit.  However, I was pretty taken aback when a very cheery and polite lady handed us our food to go.  I almost wanted to thank her for actually smiling but that probably crosses some sort of line between normal and creepy so I kept my mouth shut.

Food, food, food.  My boyfriend got the burrito bowl, which was a little smaller than expected, but still tasted great.  Was expecting beans and rice on the side, but since you already get beans and rice in the bowl, I guess you don't get more (yes, I'm greedy).  I need to read that menu again.  The tamales with beans and rice were good, tamales a little dry and crumbly and needed some reheating by the time I got home (probably takes us 10 minutes to get home).  I am in love with their red salsa though.  It has a little bit of a kick, and everyone needs a little spice in their life.

Word of advice, don't do takeout.  It's still good, but from my experience, it tastes a ton better fresh.  Plus, soak up the atmosphere - it's a much livelier place than the hole in the wall it was before.  Though I kinda liked that hole in the wall...dammit, nostalgia!",2015-02-24 04:52:32

I haven't eaten at Mim's cafe in ages!  

This Saturday morning, after a mini photo shoot, my fella and I were starving, so we decided to head over to Mimi's.  Formerly a favorite and an every weekend spot, it had  been over a year since the last time we had been there.

There was a bit of a wait, about 15 minutes, but that's pretty standard for MImi's.  
We had briefly considered hitting up Cafe Zuppas next door, since we were so hungry, but I'm very glad that we chose to wait.  15 minutes isn't that bad of a wait.

After we were seated, we took a look at the menu, although my fella already knew what he wanted: the chicken chopped salad.  Its his favorite. 

For me, while I normally get a chicken Cesar, I'm on a new nutrition plan, and so I wanted to opt for something in diet.  

I chose the open faced egg white omelette with tomato, spinach, onion, and goats cheese, served with a cup of fruit.  I also chose the French Onion soup.

The soup was exactly as I remembered it:  one of the best French onion soups I've ever had.  A little salty for me, as I'm really watching my sodium intake, but delicious.  

The omelette was perfect.  I asked for it well done (I hate runny eggs), and it was cooked well, and all of the flavors were wonderful.  

Service was very friendly, too.

They had a green Chile salsa and a Chipotle salsa, but not the typical chunky salsa with tomatoes and such. Second, somehow the chips were stale, yet the bag managed to leave grease stains on my counter at home. The guacamole was good, though. Most people put too much garlic powder in their recipe, but this was just right.

First things first the good:
Compared to Subway the bread had a better texture. It wasn't overly hard or too soft...just right in my opinion. The roast beef tasted pretty good! It actually tasted as if it could be a decent quality beef...but what do I know, this was my 2nd or 3rd time eating roast beef. The vegetables on the sub were nice and firm, and not so overpowering that they made my sandwich soggy.

The bad:
For the size of the sub (8inch) it would've been better if they'd filled the open spaces with more meat or toppings. The sandwich seemed a bit naked and skimpy. 

The ugly:
So this is the one thing that actually made me question their superiority to Subway. THE TASTE OF THE BREAD! Okay, so if Subway uses rubber in their bread, what is it that these guys use?! I can't explain the taste except if I tasted my hair relaxer, I'm pretty certain that would be it :-/ It had such a chemical like je ne sais quoi.

While the stadium is great, its location hurts it the most.  It is a must-see during a Cactus League trip but for locals, it is probably not worth the drive unless you're a fan of the teams that play there.

Situated just south of Bell Road and just past one of the worst intersections in the Valley, Suprise Stadium stands out.  It sits in the middle of a relatively empty complex which is part of the problem.  There isn't anything to do around the stadium before or after the game making it hard to make this stadium a destination.  It is best to take Grand Ave to Thunderbird and then go north on Bullard.  

Once you reach the stadium, parking is free, which is nice, but is sometimes confined to dirt lots.  The stadium is beautiful and reminiscent of the Rangers' big league in Arlington.  There are nice grass seats and newer wide seats behind home plate.  The seats down both lines are drenched in sun, however.  Shade can be found on the concourse under the press box but it is a narrow passage that gets crowded on hot days.  The upper level seats are quite nice and, like Peoria, offer shade and a wait staff.

The food options at Surprise are somewhat limited.  There isn't much in the way of independent vendors which leaves you to the standard ballpark fare.

Surprise is a beautiful park.  It stands out in architecture from every other park in the league.  It is like a Major League park that has been shrunken down.  While this is nice, it does not cater to the fans in the way that some other parks do.  It's a nice place, but I'm glad my team place elsewhere.",2009-03-03 17:07:32

Last Monday I decided I needed new tires for my car. After a little online shopping I decided on Discount Tire and gave them a call. Since I was heading out of town Tuesday and Wednesday I made an appointment for Thursday at 8:00 AM.

I arrived about 40 minutes late, but had called ahead to let them know and when they checked me in they said it wasn't a problem. After asking for the car to be done by noon and being assured it would be ready I was on my way back to the office.

12:30 PM comes and I gave the store a call to confirm the car was ready and was told it was all set. I had one of my friends come and give me a ride to Discount Tire. 

I usually don't check the work, but today something struck me to take a look at the car before I went inside. Low and behold the car hadn't moved since I dropped it off in the morning. I went inside and stood in line and when I was finally waited on I brought the situation to their attention. 

Unfortunately I needed my car for afternoon appointments and couldn't wait any longer even though they offered to get it in right away and get it done in 15 minutes.

I left the store extremely upset as I had planned on leaving on vacation the next day and was out of time to get the tires. When I got back to the office I decided to give them a call and wound up speaking to an Assistant Mgr. 

Ultimately he offered to pick up my car and bring it back to me which was the best solution they could have offered. I really appreciated it.

Before this experience I would have given Discount Tire 4 or 5 stars and in the end they made it right. I just wish they would have done the work when they were supposed to.",2010-11-22 03:17:34

The only reason for 4/5 stars is the windows don't really look too clean. But considering how great everything else looks I'm really not complaining.

They don't accept reservations, but if you have a large group then you're allowed to call ahead 30 minutes and they will start to think about where to put you. Downside is that even if they have a table ready for you, you're not allowed to be seated until your entire party is there. This is kind of a bad business practice as one in our group had a cast on her foot and was forced to stand in the doorway dodging other patrons until they caved and let us sit down at our table with six of our party there. To be fair to the few that were late, the parking get's filled up fast in the Old River Shopping area and you'll have to circle around a couple times or do like I did and park down the road and walk a little ways to the restaurant. 

For the food I got the July burger of the month, I think it was called 3 pigs or something? It had pulled pork, pork belly, ? and coleslaw on it. Although the burger patty seemed a little plain and lacked seasoning, overall the sandwich was good and big enough to share. The burgers are priced at $7.50 for plain and up to $16 for a bison burger with most burgers falling around the $10 mark. The burgers don't come with anything so you'll be set back an additional $4.50-$6.50 for a side of fries or onion rings, but the portions are enough for two. I opted for the sweet potato fries with a horseradish mustard sauce and they were pretty tasty. My dining companions all seemed to enjoy the various burgers they got and we passed around the sides. The onion rings are huge, but I didn't really care for them, they seemed bland. The chili cheese fries were tasty. The truffle fries were okay, but a little too herby and oily for me. Our waitress was pleasant and informative (even showed me a picture of the July burger special on her phone) and I liked the décor (they have those garage door windows that can be pulled up in the summer), only thing is it is really loud in there and it was hard to hear the people at my table talking.

I've been back for the one red door burger and the mac & cheese with BBQ brisket. The mac & cheese came in at $9.50 and looks a little plain and like it is lacking sauce but don't be fooled, I found it to be pretty good. Again with the burger I wasn't that impressed with the meat, but it was good overall. My sweet potato fries were a little well done and salty, but I ate them. 

Overall I'd say FlipSide is on the same level as The Rail, Heck's, Jammy Buggars or B-Spot. They all serve a ""higher-end"" version of the burger with alcohol in the milkshakes and aioli dipping sauces. I'd hit up this place again. Also, the Old River Shopping area is a nice spot to take a stroll after your meal and maybe even get some gelato at Rosso's.",2015-07-17 16:58:10

My bosses from out of town like Miller's Ale House for lunch because it's rarely busy on the weekday, there's enough on the menu to satisfy anyone, and the food is okay. The service has been great both times I've been here and the prices are decent.  The menu is comparable to what you'll find at an Applebee's, Chili's, and BJ's.  The difference is that the food here cost less and you get a lot more. Miller's Ale House even has a daily lunch special.  I've been to this location a few times and have tried their Chicken Caesar Salad and Salmon.  Both did its job and pretty much satisfied my hunger. The salmon is portion is average, but they're willing to hook it up if you ask nicely.  Overall, I really had no complaints and the service was great.

Chicken!!!  Best Ethiopian Meat Dish I have eaten so far!  Spicy and FULL of Flavor!  Perfectly Prepared!!!!  Biggest difference must be the blend and volume of seasonings used!!! 

Most Unique Timatim and Spiciest though my least favorite of all the ones I have eaten... I do not think it is on the menu...Also they prepared it with no Injera ""in"" the Timatim by our request!

Injera was very good for Injera... Funny every time I eat this bread I like it more!

Lentils, Mmmmm and Excellent version of this popular Ethiopian Dish! Maybe my favorite of all the Ethiopian Style Lentils

Collards very GREAT flavor, Perfect!

Cabbage A-OK, nice flavor,very similar to what you would expect.

Sambusa very flavorful though it was missing the usual accompanying Spicy Green Sauce, still Excellent flavor!

Chicken Taquitos (from the freezer section of a Grocery store) Awful!  Is this Tex-Mex on Ethiopian?  This was the only part of the meal that was a Total Disappointment..

Dishes are ""Made to order"" so it will take a little longer than you may expect if you are not used to eating at Very Good Ethiopian restaurants!  Service is OK, do not expect the man to be overly friendly until he knows you, do not expect your order to be 100% !  Still it is some very good food except the Taquitos!

It was quite a coup for the new Downtown Phoenix Hilton Garden Inn to get a restaurant as popular as Nook as their marquee restaurant.  Curious to see how it stacked up against their original location, I decided to treat my Mom to a meal here on a hot summer Wednesday evening.

The Downtown location is much larger than the original with probably about three times as much indoor seating as well as patio seating (not in use during a 110 degree day of course, but still).  The interior does bare a pretty decent resemblance to the Arcadia location, albeit with a decidedly more urban flare.  You have to walk through the lobby of the hotel to get there, just FYI.  Also, I strongly recommend walking or biking here as parking is expensive.  It's valet parking only and costs $12 (and that's after validation).  One other thing a few Yelpers have accurately pointed out is that while the menu here is almost identical to the Arcadia location, the Downtown location's prices are noticeably higher.  Maybe the rent is way more expensive here?  On average it seems like most of the items are about $4-$5 more expensive at the Downtown location.  Just a few things to keep in mind.

Alright the food.  I'll just go into what I had.  We split an order of the Arancini to start off.  Seven fried balls of risotto and mozzarella cheese with a tomato puree and balsamic reduction.  A delicious start to be sure.  For my entree, I went with the Bolognese.  A hearty beef and pork pasta covered with copious amounts of a ground sausage and tomato sauce.  This will fill most stomachs all by itself and I really want to package that sauce for future use.  For dessert,  I grabbed a slice of the Ooey Gooey Butter Cake.  Basically a slice of super soft cheese cake topped with cream and a blueberry compote.  They hit all the right notes with this one and I really liked the texture of the crust.  

Total price for my half of the Arancini, the Bolognese, the Ooey Gooey Butter Cake, tax and tip came to about $70.  If you're looking for a cheaper experience, my advice would be to come during happy hour and work the happy hour menu tapas style.  And again, arrive via bike or on foot (or even via light rail) if possible and save your car from the expensive valet.  So I'll say 3.5 stars for my first time here.  The prices are a little steep both in the restaurant and getting a parking spot, but the food at Nook is reliably solid and worth the trouble.  I'd probably still recommend the Arcadia location as a first option if you're on a tight budget, but the Downtown location is a welcome addition to the continuing Downtown culinary renaissance.",2016-06-24 03:39:25

Bottom line is that there's nothing new here that you won't find at any other buffet in town, and although it's a self-perpetuating problem, the lack of customers meant that the food was mostly sitting out rather than being refreshed and looked old and was not terribly warm.

We enjoyed our room on our second night, but that was only after being moved; on our first night, the first room we were assigned to seemed a bit odd - there was a massive sheet/drape covering the bed and headboard when we arrived, which seemed suspicious.  In addition to that, the phone wasn't working and the toilet wasn't flushing properly.  So we asked for a new room, and were given one right away - however, the new room was significantly smaller than the first, and quite cramped.  It also had a bit of a sewage smell in the bathroom (perhaps Montreal water issues?).   In any case, the next morning, when we mentioned that, we were quickly upgraded to a bigger and better room.  I think the issue on the first night, was that the night staff on duty was new; had we taken up the initial issue with the day staff, I think we would have been upgraded on the first issue.  Regardless, the final room was clean, spacious, and airy feeling, so we were quite content.   The day staff made a point of reaching out to us and trying to make our stay satisfactory.

One other issue - parking.  The only parking lot is down the street, and there is construction going on right next door to the hotel, which sometimes blocks off the street in front of the hotel.  So it can be tricky to pull the car up out front, and then the walk to the car feels long in cold weather.

Nice hotel with a cool vibe.  Stay here if you're looking for something ""sexy"" but not necessarily for the amenities of a regular hotel.",2014-02-27 01:39:58

You walk in and you feel you're more in a sports bar/English pub than a Chinese restaurant. The hostess seats you and then you're not served for 10 minutes. Eventually a server comes by and takes your order. I got the hot & sour soup and the eggplant w/chicken. I then proceeded to wait for 15 minutes before the soup arrived. The waitress was a little frenzied when she brought the soup and then disappeared again before I could ask her for some hot sauce.  I flagged down a busser for it instead, and he seemed pretty annoyed that I asked him to do something beyond wiping off tabletops. The soup was decent but it wasn't nearly the best that I've had.

I then waited another 15 minutes before got my entree. The eggplant tasted alright, but the ground chicken it was mixed with was downright disgusting. Smelled and tasted completely rotten. After four spoonfuls I decided I couldn't eat it anymore. But my waitress was nowhere to be found. I then spotted her from across the way and gave the ""I'd like my check"" hand signal. I then waited for 15 more minutes. I didn't see my waitress anywhere. I walked up to the hostess and ask for my check. She gave me my bill and asked if I want to pack the food for home, to which I declined. 

I pay and leave the place, and see that my waitress is hanging out at the bus stop. Apparently her shift was over and she was going home, but I was left sitting there at the booth with a plate of smelly ground chicken and a mood of anger something large.

I'm really hoping this isn't the ""best Chinese restaurant in Phoenix"" because the service sucked donkey balls and the food was nowhere near good enough to make up for it.

No. There were six rolls in each order and they were HUGE. I was only able to finish one of each and I was completely stuffed. They were homemade and absolutely amazing. The flavors were awesome and they went deliciously with their homemade ranch.

There were no surprises. In fact, things weren't as bad as I had expected. Heidi, the hygienist, was a sweetheart. She told me what I was doing right and what I could improve on without making me feel guilty. And Nicki, the receptionist, told me in great detail all of the expected costs and the schedule for the work to be done, and sent me home with a written account of those costs to look over with my husband.

The owner said though that they've been selling way more with cheddar since the mind of a chef show was there.  But swiss, for sure the swiss.  Also go with the full sour pickles as well.  Don't even mess with the half sour, because who wants a half strength picked?  

Lots of childhood memories come back with the special.  Not because I've been here before but I remember by dad making grilled balcony and cheese sandwiches.  So on that level this place might rock your world if it tricks some childhood issues.  

But how do you rate an Institution with such a long history that awakens nostalgia?  Really , you probably can't and be honest.  Part of you will want to rate high just because of the history and the fact that it is a very damn fine sandwich.  And there is probably some small part of you whispering to try and not rate it high due to some food snobbery or other issues or just being contrary.  For me, this place is something everyone should try once no matter what.  For some of you it will be 5 star and bring back childhood memories and for others you might not understand.  That is fine, but like I said everyone should go at least once.  But why 4 stars and not 5?  For me 5 has to be transcendent or reproducibly great.  I've only been once.

Another is the lack of parking in Plaza Midwood, which affects all businesses there, not just Soul. There is no parking specifically for the restaurant, so be careful were you park, many places in the area may tow your car.

The BF and I went here last night for their first birthday party...and it was wonderful! Now, we went one of their first days last year for our anniversary and once our waitress found that out, we were treated wonderfully. We were given glasses of champagne on the house... how thoughtful! We ordered the grilled cheese as a starter, and it was good. A grilled cheese is a grilled cheese, but it was good... I loved the bacon inside and the soup it came with was smokey and delicious. For entrees I had the short rib and the BF had the shepherd's pie. The short rib was very good... fell apart and had a nice flavor. The mashed potatoes and green beans that came with it were also delicious. The BF's shepherd's pie was also delicious, but it came out on the cool side... BUT when our waitress was informed, she handled the situation perfectly. She apologized and replaced the meal quickly with a new one. The new one was perfect AND the size was much larger than the first time we went to this restaurant. We ordered the pecan fig pie for dessert and it was much better than the last time we had it. The pie had a nice consistency and the ice cream was very good. In addition, they brought us a piece of chocolate birthday cake that was rich and delicious. Needless to say, I was ridiculously stuffed. When we got our bill, we were informed that they comped our pie for our anniversary. So our bill was 18$. For real. They had entrees for 1$, comped champagne, comped pie, comped cake.... This was the best deal for a wonderful meal. The service, as always, was spot on, and I like that they really made us feel special for our anniversary.

q7fbpIy1efddiBA0tufNZg,_t3BJzyGaqr9mcDazYiYAQ,G8qvbhfbCyMAeZzYrbmZxA,3,5,3,1,"Carmen easily could have had a higher rating, but the staff were so pushy and I constantly felt as though I was just a face at table that they wanted to rotate. The uncomfortable and rushed feeling that I had took away from my ability to enjoy the good food.

I understand that they have to make their money, but I was really put off by the fact that the server asked me if I wanted to order something even before my guest arrived! Why would I want to be so presumptuous and rude as to order food before my guest even arrives???

And it's not like I was waiting long. I happened to be a little early and she was a little late. The restaurant was also almost empty at this time.

Here's a tip to Carmen: If you want to sell people a bunch of food, have a table that is big enough for them to eat the food on OR bring the food slowly so that your guests can enjoy. Clearly, it's all about their profit margins and nothing about the comfort of the guest. The only decent table in the house is the cute round booth to the right of the hostess stand.

The food that they remembered to order came out far too quickly and the things that the server forgot, we had to remind her of and then wait for. At least this afforded my friend and I time to chat.

I had two cocktails and a glass of wine, my friend had Sangria. It's not like we weren't making them money.

Now the food was another story:

I was excited to try Carmen since I've always been a big fan and supporter of Torito. Chef Luis makes some serious Spanish food as well as being a super friendly guy. We were definitely impressed with everything we ate.

The Patatas Bravas were perfectly seasoned and delightfully crispy. The Green and Red Salad with Avocado was refreshing, although hard to cut. The blood sausage with Chick pea soffrito and crispy fried egg was true culinary genius with such contrasting textures and flavours. Tender octopus in a tin was amazing with a savoury red sauce and little round potatoes. The clams in green sauce were succulent, accompanied by a bright basil sauce and cucumber. The rabbit rillette was really smooth but needed a few more crostini, which they were nice enough to offer to us before we asked.

Fried artichokes were staggeringly delicious.

The paelllas going out looked and spelled wonderful. I would have loved to try the Montana Paella with Artichokes, Snails and rabbit, but snails are not for everyone.

Try the Federico cocktail. It's like a sightly spicy not too sweet margarita with sage and lemon.

Carmen was a delicious culinary tour of Spain. Something I've always appreciated  when dining at Torito. But Carmen's overzealous staff who seem to lurk behind your table and wait for you to leave or suggest ordering before your guest arrives completely ruined the experience for me. I might venture back to try the Paella, but i need to get over the awful feeling of being rushed. The server brought our bill without asking if we were finished.

Dining out is an experience that's why I pay for someone else to cook for me and bring my food, and if you've ever been to Spain and had Tapas there, you know that you are encouraged to linger and taste, watch people and engage in conversation.

But the hipsters have ruined all of this for us and made Toronto a city full of slapdash restaurants that cattle herd their patrons in and out, grinding all of our appreciation for dining to a lead stump.",2013-12-29 15:26:14

We initially wanted to go to Eat. because of the Yelp reviews, but they were busy. Saw this place pop up on the search for brunch, but... They only serve brunch on Sundays from what I overheard. LOL. Too late. Once we were seated and looked quizzically at the menu, our server had already introduced himself. Not going to lie, my sister was intrigued by the menu by then too. 
It was also cool to have the host recommend Eat. to other patrons that were looking for brunch. Shows how supportive the area was of other establishments, and honest to a certain extent. 
Let's see... 
I ordered a Bloody Mary, and for appetizers we ordered the Tuna Tartare and Margherita Flatbread. Our server, Rodney, seriously persuaded me to order the Bloody Mary. Hahaha... Not that it takes much to convince me when it comes to drinks. I was sold on the idea of mixing it myself 'cause sometimes bartenders tend to make it too spicy for me. Anyway, we both liked his style which wasn't too pushy to make us order more, and helped us relax in trying a new place. He was pretty much like ""If you guys are still hungry after your appetizers, and just want to hang out here a little longer, then just order more later. No pressure."" 
Oh my gah... The Tuna Tartare... I was lucky to even get a third of that plate! The taro chips were yummy by itself, and the tartare had fresh ingredients that paired nicely with the raw tuna. My sister seriously didn't want to share! The Margherita Flatbread was just as yummy - I always like it when the tomatoes are baked along with the rest of the ingredients, and having the basil be the fresh part of the dish.
Coming back to check on us, and joking about how fast I needed a second Bloody, we ordered entrees... Goujons (sweet Thai chili) with fries added (technically an appetizer) for the sister, and I got the Chimichurri Chicken Sandwich. 
Rodney gave us a story about the sandwich being too spicy for a past patron as a warning. LOL. Dude... That was not spicy at all. I kept biting into my first half of the sandwich looking for spice! It was still pretty good though. I love the fresh avocado with it. I had more avocado mouse/sauce on the side, but I honestly liked the Aioli sauce my sister got. Liked dipping my fries into that. My sister also enjoyed her chicken with the Thai chili sauce. Sad to say we couldn't finish it all, but we were just being polite and saving leftovers for our dad. LOL. He wasn't too happy that we went on a sibling date without him. 
Anyway, food alone, this place gets 4 stars for flavor and variety of dishes. Giving it 5 for the outstanding customer service provided by Rodney. 
Noticed that he was the only server on the floor. The impressive thing was that even though he seemed to have to take care of the entire restaurant, the indoors and the patio, he still managed to check up on us several times. If anyone can make my sister smile and relax as a first time patron, I can seriously appreciate that. Seriously... Thanks to him, my sister's mood got a little better, considering she didn't even want to go to Downtown for a meal.

Seriously though, don't let Jilly's next door deceive you- our brunch gathering at Prohibition certainly resulted in a happy ending. 

What I ordered:
Bison burger ($13)- DELICIOUS. Admittedly, the best burger I have had all summer. The bread is made in house, super moist and chewy. The bison was also grilled to a medium rare perfection (or however you like it). Just deliciousness, deliciousness all around.

Soup of the Day ($6)- Smoked Tomato. Equally amazing and my favourite tomato soup to date. The smoky flavour had a strong presence, but not overwhelming as you can also taste a nice background of spices. I definitely thanked Past-Sisi and gave myself a pat on the back for ordering this. It was one of those mid-August days where you start to feel the chill fall air creeping in, and the soup felt like a warm Snuggie in my tummy. 

Other impressive things:
- Unique menu: It is filled with plenty of  fun items that you don't typically see on brunch menus, from Mexican Waffles to Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese to Pulled Pork Grilled Cheese (Future-Sisi better be seriously grateful for Present-Sisi for resisting the temptation to get this. Seriously. Grateful.) The menu also describes each item in fancy sounding words like lardon and essence of truffle that makes you feel like you're at a fancy brunch place when in actuality you are not and are actually only in a pub next to a strip club. 

- Most things are made in-house: I.e. they have an in-house smoker that smokes fish and meats to my delicious smoked tomato soup. They also bake their own bread. They fry a lot of the items with duck fat aka extra delicious fat. 

- Friendly service in a relaxing atmosphere

I suggest buying your own bowling shoes even if you only bowl once or twice a month for fun. It eventually pays for itself and you won't get other people's foot cooties.

Seriously, I dig this bowling alley because it feels like a local joint. I would recommend this place for a fun date night or moderately-priced family activity.",2013-08-17 05:46:25

Bartender brought us water but did not take a drink order. When we finally got her attention we asked about the food since it is a complicated menu. They seem to be excited about their pizza but have their own lexicon and she did a poor job of explaining, but in her defense there is a lot to explain and it was busy. Manager standing around watching instead of helping. Back to reading menu. Decided to just get the pizza special. 
Beer came. Very short pour.  When I questioned I was told it was a higher alcohol beer so, like many places, it was an eight ounce poor in a snifter. Ok. But I poured out water glass and poured in beer and at best it was a six ounce poor. At best. Additionally, they are charging $8  for that small pour for a mid-range local craft beer. 
Then we were told the kitchen was backed up and the wait would be at least 30 minutes. Time to leave. 
Bartender talked to the manager and came back and offered some cheese curds but we were already heading out. Paid for the drinks snd left.

We both have never been disappointed in the breakfast. I had their Florentine Benedict every time and I think it is very tasty. I love the hollandaise sauce and the English muffin.

I was happy to finally try it with a friend courtesy of Groupon.  The menu has some great choices.  But it's definitely on the more expensive side. My friend ordered the Greek Pasta and really enjoyed it. I had the Lemon Chicken with Greek Fries. The fries were terrific. The chicken was tasty, but given than it was a half chicken I thought it was a little on the petite side.  I ordered a piece of espresso cake to go.  It was good but when I went to eat it later that night it seemed to be missing most of the bottom layer which was disappointing after I had to wait ten minutes for it to be boxed up.

I've since returned with the same friend (this time with a Pittsburgh Dining Card).  We decided to get the Greek fries as an appetizer since we both liked them so much last time along with the spanikopita.  For our entrees, my friend got the tapenade pizza and I selected the lamb kabobs.  I'm not usually a fan of olives, but that pizza was quite tasty.  My lamb kabobs were exactly what I wanted, sitting gently on rice pilaf.  For dessert we both decided on the warm comfort of the milopita.

My hubby and I frequent Bouchon as one of our favorite strip restaurants for dinner. The foie terrine and hot epi bread always has us coming back for more. However on a recent brunch the service was less than stellar. 

Things were off to a good start as we were sat at ""our table"" which they also call the Anthony Bourdain table. A crescent shaped banquette made of crushed velour is super comfortable and always romantic. You can ask for it by name and they'll know which one you're talking about. 

We were sat promptly but once seated we were left hanging for a very long time before our server finally appeared. When she did stop by she seemed less than impressed by us

I ordered the Apple Croissant and the Gravlax for me brekie. Apple croissant, wholly hell man, this is fuck-yeah pastry. Imagine this super light flakey buttery heart stopping layers of sheer awesomeness topped with caramelized apples and strudel. Now imagine that this is no imagination, its real, its good and I ate this delicacy ever so slowly as to not miss a single flavor moment. Honestly this alone is worth 5 stars however its the combined experience that makes up these stars. 

Gravalax. First off I need to say that I don't eat salmon very often unless it's coming from a trusted source and yes Thomas Keller is definitely a trusted source. For me this his is like Swedish sushi, beautifully fatty cured raw salmon with accompaniments of capers, tomatoes, onions and chive cream cheese. No bagel here, you get a warm crispy baguette instead. Im not bitching about this as I love anything baked from Bouchon and was a really nice way to stack and eat this dish. I felt very euro. 

Back to the service.. our water glasses went empty, nobody checked on us after our food was delivered (my dining companion had an issue so we waved down a busboy so he could find our server), it was like we were abandoned. I don't like that the food was better than the service since to me both should have equal standing. 

While I would go back for dinner Im not sure if its worth going for breakfast/brunch especially since all the pastries can be purchased at one of the Bouchon Bakeries inside the Venetian. I still think about the croissant.",2013-01-29 01:38:07

Don't worry, I'm not going to get on my soap box and preach about how they help the local economy by keeping more of their revenues in the communities they serve. Nor will I go on about the way they support other small businesses by sourcing ingredients and supplies locally. What I love most of all, they take risks that many corporation restaurants wouldn't dare.

Take Maui Dog for instance, l mean really, who opens a restaurant specializing in Hawaiian style hot dogs? Ask owner John Stamatakis, who started his hot dog venture last year in the building that housed Ricky's Philly. The tiny structure has gotten the island treatment with tiki torches, bright colors and a warm friendly vibe. What they don't have in square footage they make up for in charm and of course menu offerings. 

The menu boasts a series of hot dogs, sliders and some serious toppings. There is one nagging question though, what's a Hawaiian hot dog? To be honest, I had no idea until I did some research. Ends up Hawaiian hot dogs are just like any other hot dog except for a slightly sweetened bun, some variation of garlic mayo and a laundry list of tropical flavors including passion fruit infused mustard to chopped banana and coconut. 

Before I go on about the food, I have to give you one bit of advice, ask them to make sure they steam the buns! On my visit this crucial detail wasn't fulfilled so what I ended up with were slightly dry and mostly stale buns. I made mention of this to the owner who quickly offered to replace the order, this is what I call great customer service. 

On first bite I felt deep love for MD's Lava Dog Shaggy Style ($5.50). Its a beef hot dog slather in lava, which is their house made chili, then topped with cheese and coleslaw, the later making it shaggy. I went further and ordered it Maui style, which means that it will additionally be topped with chipotle garlic mayo, Maui mustard, coconut and pineapple. I had no idea you could pile so much on one hot dog and still have it work. It's a whole lot of flavor but melds so well together. Fortunately the heat from the chili and hot dog also managed to make the extremely soft and what I love saying, squishy. 

Okay canned meat has a really bad wrap, nothing like congealed animal parts to make a person run for the hills. So bear with me when I say go ahead and try a Spam Slider ($1.25). Ordinarily I would have never ordered one but the lady at the counter assured me it was worth a taste. My only experience with Spam was my mothers doing, Span sandwiches, come on, you've had them too! Anyway, once you top a slice of grilled Spam with sweet mustard, coconut and pineapple, Maui style, I think you might have a different impression, sweet and salty is a great combo. 

If Spam isn't your bag, go for the Teriyaki Slider ($1.25), Maui style of course. This version replaces the Spam with a tender ground beef patty and a smothering of teriyaki sauce. 

If you love potatoes with your hot dogs and sliders, be sure to order a basket of MD's hand cut French Fries ($1.75). These are the real deal, tender with a slight crisp. If you want sheer crunch good times order up the Tater Tots ($1.75). These little chubs of shredded potato come out super crispy and well seasoned. 

Judging by the steady stream of diners, it seems like this indie resto is a hit with the locals. Just be sure to get those buns steamed.",2011-03-20 15:29:31

The location of this restaurant is primo.  They're right in the middle of Desert Ridge, close to the movie theaters and other stores.  

The atmosphere is nice and the food is mediterranean.  Pita's, gyros, falafel, kebabs etc, can be found on the menu.  The time I went, it was pretty busy in there.  It was around lunch time, but the servers still managed to hold it together.  

But the time of day just doesn't matter with Desert Ridge.  No matter when you go, it will always be busy.  I've always wondered why too. How can that many people be shopping during the day?  Don't these people have jobs? Anyways, so my guess is that Pita Paradise will probably always be a little busy, but the food is good, so check it out.",2007-05-25 15:40:45

First, I am really confused by the raw bar situation. It's summer. In the desert.  I may be a seafood snob having lived on the east coast a long time, but damn, there is no water anywhere near and these people are sserving up raw oysters in July.  Ya don't eat oysters if there isn't an ""R"" in the month; and in the South , March/April are still shady months to eat them.

Um, no.

I ordered the ""Famous Chinese chicken salad"".  I'm not sure why it's famous because it's flavorless.  To me, Asian based salads as such should have more of a peanut presence. Nada.  No seseme, peanut, cilantro. It was rather bland. Fresh, but bland.

I did enjoy the meat/cheese board appetizer. 

I love Fox restaurants, but I have to say , based on my one experience it was just so so.  I'd give it another try, however.  My service was impeccable, the food was fresh; but perhaps I ordered wrong. (not as wrong as people who eat oysters in the desert in July though)",2014-07-28 04:43:58

From the second I walked into the Pawn Shop in the afternoon to check if they had any availability that night, I could tell this establishment understood hospitality. I was treated like a welcomed guest rather than a last minute bother. 

When we showed up early for our reservation, we were greeted like regulars even though it was our first visit. We stopped at the bar and ordered two glasses of Cava from Casey, our pleasant, friendly, informative bartender.

Before long, our table was ready and we were escorted to our table in the beautiful, if a little dimly lit dining room. The menu here is mainly small plate, meant for sharing type of set up. There are a few larger options listed under the Prime Meats section, but since we had steak the night before, we decided to stick with the smaller options.

Dish #1
Roasted Bone Marrow with Rioja Braised Shallot Marmalade and Grilled Bread.

Bone Marrow is everywhere these days, but we love it and order it just about every time we see it. This was one of our favorite versions ever. The combination of the Rich, Meaty Marrow, Sweet Shallots, Crunchy, Perfectly Grilled Bread was one of the best bites I've had in a long time.

Dish #2
Grilled Cheese and Smoked Bacon Dumplings on Tomato Soup.

These one bite wonders were the highlight of the night. They brought back childhood memories of dipping my grilled Velveeta sandwich into my Campbell's Tomato Soup, only a thousand times better!

Dish #3
""Fish and Chips"" Tacos, Beer Battered Sea Bass, Chile-Lime Slaw, Crispy Matchstick Potatoes.

This was our least favorite dish of the night. It was still very good, but more one note than our other selections.

Dish #4
Basil Pesto Ravioli with Rock Shrimp and Tomato Fondue.

Excellent little pillows of pasta filled with a flavorful Pesto. They would've been fine on their own, but the sauce and perfectly cooked, juicy Shrimp took it to another level.

We were filling up so we decided against Dessert, but there were several items that looked very interesting that we will definitely save room for next time. Beauty and Essex is easily wheelchair accessible and service is wonderful. With so many dining options in Vegas, we only have two restaurants on our must visit list (N9NE and Julian Serrano Tapas).

The food is simple yet authentic, especially love the Country Style Egg Soup, so good, especially on cold days.

The fried fish with special sauce was also really good, two big filets of fish with a spicy sauce over it. Other dishes like the eggplant with garlic sauce, shredded pork with smoked tofu, and other dishes were generally very good. 

However, came here again yesterday after a few months of not eating here, things changed. The Country Style Egg Soup was still very good, but other dishes were not as flavorful as before. The Mapo Tofu has to meat like before and tasted a little bland, fish was the same, not as flavorful. King Pao shrimp tasted good but very little shrimp with tons of whole chilis and peanuts.

from the outside this place looks ghetto... especially since there is a 168 attached to it ... some sort of ghetto pool hall downstairs with wanksters and a tiny convenient store to the right...  its located upstairs inbetween both of these places... 

once up the stairs,  its not as bad as i thought it would be..  service was poor, the tea throughout my stay remained empty.  i saw endless amount of people try to pour tea but was never refilled.  luckily i sat next to all the food.. i saw when the ""good stuff"" came out.. such as lobster.. but guess what.. it rarely ever gets filled and they put the nastiest garbage pieces.. im talking pure shell and no meat pieces at all.. no exaggeration.. they put the head and just shells... i dont know if that is because people want the flavor for their broth .. or people like to eat boiled lobster shells... maybe its just for looks.

all the meats were really frozen to the point its in one big clump.  and i see this old guy who keeps bringing things to the back.. and bringing it back out with maybe one or two more items added to the bin.. which makes me think they are recycling the food..   wilted vegetables.. and they kept advertising icecream all over the walls and flyers.. but guess what.. NO ICECREAM.. in fact no dessert.. only dessert you will get is a sour orange if you want.

Looking for something exotic, inexpensive, fast and within a 10 minute drive to our final destination, we brought up Yelp! on my phone and searched for nearby restaurants. 

I love Vietnamese food. So much so, that when I lived in California and I would go back east to visit my family, I would drive an hour in rush hour traffic in Arlington, VA to go to my absolute favorite Vietnamese place called Cafe Dalat. Anyone familiar with traffic in the DC area knows this restaurant must have been amazing to suffer a voluntary 2 hour commute and it was. Alas, Cafe Dalat has since closed and that is a different story for a different day.

Pulled over on the side of the road and huddled over the phone, we saw that there was a new, modern Vietnamese place within a few minutes drive and that had great reviews and our minds were made up. 

The restaurant is a small but well designed coverted store front house on 7th Street in downtown Phoenix.  Although they specialize in spring rolls and fresh rice paper rolls, they also offer a selection of pho (soup), goi (salad), bahn-mi (sandwiches) as well as a few mini entrees. If you get 2-3 rolls per person and share a soup or mini entree, you'll be full by the time you leave. The service is pleasant, knowlegable and efficient. The bathrooms are unisex. The seating is cozy and intimate- think party of 2 or 4 rather than 6-8 although if you get there early enough, there is a bar style table in the middle of the restaurant that can seat around 6 people. 

As for the rolls, my favorite were the crispy ""Budda"" and the fresh veggie tempura soft rice paper roll. If you are looking for a meat filled roll, try a traditional pork or grilled chicken with basil roll served with hoisin sauce. 

The last time we went, I think we ordered crispy calimari and lemon grass chicken with garlic noodles; both great. We were sitting next to a woman and her daughter who were both eating Pho and the fragrance of it was so amazing that I had to ask them how it was. The mother said that it was some of the best Pho in town and if it wasn't 115 in August, we probably would have ventured to try some. 

At around $15-20 per person including a cocktail (they have great HH prices too), this was definitely a modern take on some Vietnamese classics.",2012-11-08 04:35:04

All night happy hour on Sundays from 3p til 2am. 

What kind of happy hour you ask? half off appetizers, of which the Teriyaki Ribs are part of... half of maki/house rolls and half off (insert angels singing in unison here.) half off all drinks in house. yes you heard that right, half off u-call its, specialty drinks, sake bombers, sake infusion drinks... i'm telling you it's heaven for the Sunday lush!

So, why should you go other than the three things listed above? Because when you have a hankering to end the week with good times or start the week in a drunken daze this my yelpers is the place to go. The atmosphere is great, good music, good vibes, good drinks, music videos to watch, oh and yummy teriyaki ribs to scarf down, oh and good eye candy, girls and boys alike to secretly check out. Oh, and if you have a big group make sure to reserve a table for groups 10 or more coz it's crowded by 5. and when they say the wait time is at least an hour, believe it coz no ones leaving a good happy hour at Geisha! deuces!",2010-08-23 18:22:08

I was seated promptly in the back room rather than take a table at the bar.  The whole place including this room are very dark with mirrors most notably running the length of the ceiling.

My server brought a menu and a water glass was filled.  The server stopped by again and asked about drinks and I ordered my usual iced tea which was soon brought.  My dinner consisted of three tapas plates--octopus ceviche with grapefruit and pickled jalapeño, shrimp risotto with a tomato fondue and arugula, and ricotta gnocchi with braised short rib and pea purée.  For dessert, I got the chocolate makeout--a warm chocolate fondant with salted caramel cream, peanut brittle, and caramel sauce.

The octopus ceviche was very good.  The dish had a good citrus flavor from the grapefruit and the pickled jalapeños added a good contrast.  Served with the dish was a small amount of corn chips which I ate along with the octopus.

The shrimp risotto was OK.  There was nothing special about the dish.  The shrimp were large but the dish as a whole lacked any wow factor to make the whole standout.   The shrimp were also a bit chewy.

Last was the ricotta gnocchi with braised short rib and pea purée.  I really liked this dish. The short rib was very tasty as opposed to the bland ricotta gnocchi and there was no discernible taste of the pea purée at all.  Still, I liked the flavor of the short rib and the softness of the gnocchi made a good fit.

Dessert was the chocolate makeout--almost a chocolate lava cake but mercifully not another rendition of this ubiquitous dessert.  The chocolate fondant was rich and I could have piped the salted caramel cream directly into my mouth.  The peanut brittle and small amount of caramel sauce added texture and flavor to the dessert.

Service was varied.  The iced tea was brought with no sugar or other sweeteners.  When the server came by one time, he stopped and then asked if I  had wanted any sugar.  I asked for some artificial sweetener which he never brought.  After he went by a few times, I stopped a busser and asked him and I had a container of sweeteners in no time at all.

When it came time for dessert, a different server stopped by and asked me if I wanted dessert.  I ordered from her.  After dinner, the original server brought my check and took payment.

The server didn't ask if I needed anything explained from the menu nor did he mention more than one off menu special.  The other server mention a couple of them to the tab;e next to me and asked them if they had been to the restaurant before.  She then went on to describe some of the dishes and told the people if there were any other questions to ask her.  I think maybe she should have been with me the whole time.  The bus persons were very efficient and removed finished plates in a timely manner.

Crush is OK.  Your paying Strip prices for some average food.",2014-11-30 22:41:08

The shake has a very rich taste of the Ferrero Rocher chocolates and any chocolate lover would love this!

I like to try different things every time I visit, but I always include the Orange Chicken, no matter what. It's so full of flavor & spice (they will alter the spice level to your liking), and it's cooked to a perfect crisp. I like it with brown rice. Orange Chicken is a must!

General Tso Chicken is good, just not as excellent as the Orange Chicken. 

Kung Pao Beef is ok. It didn't do anything for me in the knock-my-flavor-socks-off department. 

Spicy Hon Hon Shrimp is good. It's supposed to be crunchy, but mine wasn't. I think it would better with a crunchy batter. 

It is a 100% vegetarian establishment, but everything I have had was vegan, and other dishes can be made vegan, just ask. Particularly if you're getting fried rice, otherwise, you'll get eggs in your food. So again, be sure to let them know if you're vegan. 

Nice clean restaurant. Super friendly and helpful staff. Accepts credit cards (there is a minimum order amount; I think @ $6). 

Call ahead for carry-out orders. To-go orders come in nice reusable containers. 

Can be tricky to find for first time visitors. It's in Chinatown.  If you're coming from The Strip (Las Vegas Blvd), turn west onto Spring Mountain Rd.

This time around, I think I had the better food compared to N.  N's was ok, but I still liked mine better, probably because the creme on pasta taste was a bit common place for me.  Though T didn't really like the Napolitan too much, I think I will still like it.

The okonomiyaki pasta seems to be okonomiyaki toppings on spaghetti.  Surprisingly this combination works well.  I enjoyed the dish.  It had the tart okonomiyaki sauce and the pasta gives it a unique texture compared to normal okonomiyaki.  I would order this again.


We finished off with a cake that we split three ways (it was the last one they had) and it was a strawberry/mango creme cake.  Very light, and not excessively buttery (like Saint Tropez) I enjoyed every bite of it.

The only thing preventing me from giving this place a 5 star this time was the restaurant had two full parties and the service was significantly slower (though they were a bit apologetic about it).

That was about two or three months ago? Oops.

Well, I finally got around to making good on that the other day when I was making an emergency run to Wallyworld next door. I stopped in and got my order ""for here"" instead of ""to go"" this time. Maybe there's something to be said about that choice because the sandwich (a Firehouse Hero, I believe it was called) seemed tastier and fresher right out of the oven.

Still a little pricey for a sandwich, especially after upgrading to a combo (and forgetting to get my chips -- that was my fault though), but the meats were plentiful and the veggies crisp. An a-okay sandwich, if you ask me.

In the original review I went back and forth between three and four stars and eagerly wished for a half-star. So why the fourth star this time? Staff. The crew seemed really friendly and not like they hated their job. Being in the hospitality industry, customer service is make-or-break, and theirs was quite good.

I was in the Land of the Giants, crushed on all sides by hordes of other would-be concert-goers, every one of whom was at least a foot taller than I.  It was like being trapped inside an MRI machine or under an avalanche searching for an air pocket.

Once inside, the quest for air continued.  It was warm, too warm, and I felt the air conditioner come on just a few times, and only for about a minute each time, during the more than three hours' duration of the fabulous Eagles concert.  What, MGM doesn't make enough money from gigs like this to ensure that people paying $200.15 a ticket are comfortable? (Of course, we didn't pay for our tickets, so I guess I have no right to complain.  So sue me.)  And what's with that 15 cents on each ticket category?  It could have been worse:  at least we weren't in the most expensive seats, which are foldable and open-back and all the same level. No Giants blocked my view, except that, as good as our seats were, we were still far enough from the stage that we had to watch the screens.  I don't know why I own binoculars, since I never remember to take them anywhere.

The sound system was decent enough, and the ladies' restroom was huge.  Leaving the arena was easier than getting in, since no one had to be scanned.  But we didn't park in the regular garage (I won't give away our secret), so we got stopped at the stop sign just at the walkway between the arena and the garage.  And we stayed stopped until the ENTIRE arena emptied out!  No matter that a bunch of idiot drivers behind me were actually honking their horns, we weren't permitted to move.

I came her last weekend after a long day of setting up for a Vaccine clinic. I wanted MEAT! Juicy, tender, hot MEAT. I was disappointed  when I encountered poor customer service, semi warm appetizers and mediocre entrees. 

I sat down with my two brothers and we ordered two of the red tip appetizers. We were dying and I knew that I would eat onion straws and they would get the majority of the rib tips. It wasn't that busy but the waitress took forever to come and take our order. When she finally took her order she forgot to ask for drinks and then about 10 minutes later he came back with our rib tips and no beverages. We kindly gave her our beverages and chow down on our food. The rib tips were juicy and tender and have the right amount of barbecue sauce on them. The only problem was they were somewhere warm. So I'm not sure if they forgot them and she didn't bring them to our table in time. 

About 10 minutes after that she kindly came to clear our table and take our order. Of course I ordered the two meat combo. I asked for the ribs which weren't included and the chop pork. They were kind enough to oblige my requests. My two brothers ordered burgers which are pretty simple and unassuming. We waited and waited, and waited and waited, and waited and waited, and waited some more. A good 25 minutes had to gone bybye of us in deep conversation before the meal finally arrived. My meal was incorrect. I did not get my ribs, forgot my salad and never brought out my corn muffin. No big deal those are easy fixes. My brothers burger was well done when he asked for medium rare and his fries were cold. We were so hungry at this point we just chowed down on the food not really caring. The waitress again nicely came to clear a table and give us the check. I requested that she can leave a check specifically because I was treating my brothers. When she came to bring the check back she needs it directly to my eldest brother. In my personal opinion a waitress or waiter should listen to requests. Especially with managing money. I paid gladly and after she came back to pick up the receipt she then asked "" oh no do you want dessert?""

I don't really need to say more. The food was decent and of course it's a basic barbecue environment. The restaurant was clean and the noise level was to a minimum.

 In my opinion the Mattress Factory is quintessential  of the lower North Side. The Mattress Factory is always changing and developing, hip and edgy, while at the same time being down to earth and approachable and kid friendly. 

The museum is situated amongst houses in the Mexican War Streets. And the entrance faces into an alley. This can make it easy to miss. The urban camouflage adds to not takes away from the the uniqueness and allure of the museum.

It's located in an alley way oh but the wonders that are inside!!!   The museum actually has a warm hole which in the center of a room 3 floors above the ground that you can look down into and see clear outside the museum.

This place is very kid friendly too! On my last visit I was accompanied by three young ones. My family and I had the privilege of free admission into the museum. The tab for free admission was picked up through the RADicals days program. Which provides for free admission into local museums and attractions every Fall and sponsored by Allegheny Regional Asset District.
 
 We were all well received and got to sample local urban bee keeper honey in an outdoor garden, that was located next to the museum. The kids thoroughly enjoyed this experience and so did I.  

The Mattress Factory curates a lot of interactive pieces. For instance there was an installation with a room filled with white balloons tied with white ribbon.  We were asked to write a wish on the ribbon and leave the balloon in the room for another guest to take , and in turn we were to take a balloon that already had a wish written on it and release it outside.

Thwarted, we decided to head across town, during rush hour no less to check out another spot he had been wanting to check out in Chinatown. We walked in and I was already not feeling it. The theme is cute, but not executed as well as it could be. The atmosphere just left a lot to be desired, so I was having misgivings before I even ordered. Looking at the menu, nothing really sparked much interest in me, so I decided to order the spicy Tom yum with udon and tofu, thinking it was a relatively safe bet. Ryan B ordered the beef fried rice and a tempura appetizer. 

Our meals came out and there was an odd smell emanating from the bowl. Almost a little dirty smelling?I let it sit for a while so I could build up enough courage to take a bite. I kept trying and trying and even took two bites before I totally gave up. The flavor and smell were so off. I'm not one to send food back, so I was reluctant to do it. I finally decided to let them know that I really didn't like my dish and asked our waitress to return it to the kitchen. Our server was very kind and apologetic, quickly removed the dish and told me she would remove it from our check. I really appreciated the service and how friendly they were about it. I really didn't want to send my dish back, so I was glad that they weren't too offended. 

While I watched Ryan eat, I tried a piece of the tempura had ordered and it wasn't great. A little over battered and seemed like the frozen kind you buy prepackaged at the store.

I visited on a Saturday afternoon, there was a line and service was a bit slow, but not too bad.  I opted for the big plate, 2 entrees and 1 side (or 1/2 and 1/2).  I chose the mushroom chicken and teriyaki chicken, with 1/2 fried rice and 1/2 steamed veggies, for $7.00.

I was pretty pumped that there is a place serving Indonesian food in the central Cleveland area.  It is tucked away in a random strip mall in Independence with a small dining room some random masks on the wall.  Very mom and pop.  The menu is a mix of sushi, Thai and Indonesian food.  We ordered some of the specials, including a fried chicken and a meatball and tendon soup.  We also ordered beef rendang which is a classic Indonesian and Malaysian dish.  Probably my favorite was the Indonesian grilled chicken- savory, well marinated and authentic.  The beef rendang was decent- but the portion was smaller.  The one on the Malaysian menu at PacEast on Coventry is better.  Pad Kee Mau was ok- I didn't get to eat too much of it, because everyone else got to it first.  For dessert we ordered the Indonesian pancake which was not exactly authentic (chocolate?) but was still delicious.  Sticky mango rice could have used more salt but it was still pretty good.  Overall, it was good- I probably like PacEast better but this place is heckofalot closer to me which means something to me.",2017-06-18 18:02:43

I ordered 12 hot wings (can't get a smaller order) and 6 fried mozzarella sticks.  They give everyone their order like it's to-go, so mine came in boxes in a bag.  The wings were nice and hot...waited for them to cool down.   The fried mozzarella were good in that the cheese was nice and hot and gooey...something I could thoroughly enjoy as I ate them there.  However, the breading wasn't very tasty, and they seemed too perfectly similar to have been made there.  The marinara served with them was quite good, which would bode well for their pizzas.

The wings were flavored like Frank's Hot Sauce, with plenty of sauce.  Nice and hot in temperature, with enough meat on them, these were delish.  Most places fry their wings.  I couldn't tell for sure, as the skin had a slight crispiness, but didn't taste fried.  But I found out that they were.  

So, basically, I was impressed and will return to try their (takeout) pizza!",2015-08-31 03:34:31

I used to go to the Olive Garden almost every year for my birthday, but haven't been back in a while.  When I found out I'd be having dinner there this evening, I was so unbelievably excited!  All day long all I could think about was going to this place.

Guess what?  I was not disappointed when I left!  It was exactly as I remembered it being, and I totally loved every minute of it.  My fettuccine alfredo was just perfect; not too much garlic, not too runny.  It took a little longer for the extra mushrooms I ordered to come, but it was definitely worth the wait.

And believe me, there was wait.  When we arrived at 5 PM we were told it was going to be an hour and a half wait.  I couldn't believe it, but there really was a lot of people in the place.  We decided to wait it out and have a couple of drinks at the bar before we ate.  We were all happy when, 50 minutes into the wait, we were seated.  It didn't even seem like we were waiting for that long because we were talking and laughing and having a good time still.  I stand firm on the fact that it's worth the wait.

Did you know that at the Olive Garden you get unlimited fresh bread sticks and soup or salad with EVERY meal?!  Yeah!  Isn't that awesome?  The only problem is that I usually fill up on the bread and salad before my meal even comes!  It's okay, I still manage to scarf down most of my pasta because it's so darn good!",2009-10-18 02:01:07

Although it may not be impressive in appearance or from the outside, the food is absolutely amazing. Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had.

I had their signature Bombero burrito. It had carne asada, beans, and veggies, with a nice hot sauce on the outside. The carne asada was so lean and melted in my mouth. It was extremely spicy, which I love. The tortillas are homemade, and you can certainly taste the quality they put into their product.

When we got into the line it was literally right in front of the buffet and almost onto the casino floor! Crazy! Fortunately, the line moved very quickly and we were inside the theater in no time at all!

The way the seats are staggered and inclined, there really is no bad seat in the house! Last time we were here we sat in the far back right area of the stage. This time we were in the 5th row just off left of the stage! Great seats! Close enough to see the facial expressions on the performers! 

The acoustics also sounded good as they had a live band perform during the entire duration of the show! I have also had a chance to check out a concert here and the sound was great! About 5 years ago, I saw a live performance by LeAnn Rimes here and it was a perfect spot to accommodate a small and intimate live performance! I guess during Mysteres off nights, the theater is used for other performers. Bill Cosby, Howie Mandel, Jo Koy, and many more have performed here!

Let me begin and end my review with a few comments on The Hamburg (as they call it). First off, there is a reason why it was voted ""best burger"" in multiple publications throughout the years. The ground beef patty is simple. It's thin and tastes of sweetness (possibly brown sugar?). The hamburg seems to be cooked on a diner style flat-top, helping to preserve the natural flavors. The bun is crisp, yet steamed to perfection. The melted cheese seals everything together wonderfully. The hamburg as a whole is a luscious, succulent, mouth watering experience!

The California crunch is your typical roll but it adds some crunchiness to the outside of the roll. The blue flame is crab, crab stick, avocado and sweet and spicy sauce. It has great taste over all. The Angela had always been my favorite roll at Mr Sushi (its old name). It is straight up delicious. It is deep fried crab salad, cream cheese, jalapeño, baked with cheese and a spicy sauce.

It is a seat yourself restaurant, so make sure you eye the waiter/waitress down to ensure they see you and know your presence, but never been a real issue for the last two times I have been(they're pretty on top of their game over there).
The lighting there is great, very lively colors.

Now on to the food and the service, the price is right, you really do get what you pay for, and I like that. If your on a budget and you can still get a basic morning meal at a good price and its a good amount of breakfast food for you to enjoy.

Dim Sum: overall good taste and fusion presentation. 
- Sticky Rice Chicken - usually wrapped in lotus leaf, this was presented open-concept, like sandwiches with the pork filling in between two layers of sticky rice, topped with salted egg yolk. The top of the rice was seared, giving it a nice crispy texture. Although a bit small portion and random pieces of chicken on the side, I was impressed with the presentation!

- Beef Ball - again, served open-concept on a plate instead of steamed basket. Usually not a fan of this but tried a bite and it had good flavour despite looking dry, and soft texture. Placed on top of some hard bitter melon and some corn on the side. 

- BBQ Pork Bun with crispy sweet top (don't know English name of this) - my favorite dim sum, the bun was very soft and the bbq pork was not too overpowering. 

Lobster Combo ($55 for 2 people but big enough portion for 4) - comes with steamed lobster (garlic & truffle), lobster congee (so soft and fluffy!) and e-fu noodles topped with abalone slices. No complaints, everything was good.

...to call the concept, website, and descriptors of Cowboy Ciao eclectic would be an understatement to say the least - it is almost so ""out there"" that I'd considered skipping it entirely until one of my dining companions at Pizzeria Bianco suggested that not only was it worth inclusion on my agenda, but that he'd be glad to meet me for lunch - an offer I gladly accepted.  

With somewhat shaky padded wooden chairs at each table and a menu delivered at seating my friend and I sat browsing the interior of Peter Kasperski's 1997 space with some amusement; From Mardi Gras beads strewn across chandeliers to wall paintings befitting a mom n' pop Italian space to the largely western themed exposed brick and stucco apparently little has changed in the intervening 15 years.  Chuckling to myself as I opened the menu with quotations ranging from Spaceballs to The Addams family it would be mere moments before our server, John, would stop by to fill our water and announce the daily specials.  With the afternoon crowd clearly slow and John, a good waiter but a bit more corny than would have been preferred, ever present it would be mere moments before we were ready to order and confirming all our choices as ""excellent"" we were left to chat

Discussing real estate, travel, and the area of Old-town Scottsdale it would be a mere 15 minutes before our first courses would arrive and for my appetizer I selected Duck Confit Relleno with roasted shallots, queso Oaxaca, cheddar, and roasted guajillo-tomatillo salsa, I will fully admit that I ordered this dish largely based on the fowl but what I received turned out to be large, bold, and unexpectedly quite sweet.  Beginning first with the Relleno itself, a cored pasilla chili pepper absolutely stuffed with confit and cheese then fried and coated with even more cheese the flavor was exemplary.  With fresh sliced avocado and the squeaky cheese taming the pepper while the crisp duck nicely juxtaposed the creamy cheddar it was the green salsa that really served as the most surprising part of this dish - an acidic pineapple flavor with a slightly heated finish.

For ours second course we'd see Cowboy Ciao's most famous dishes - first the ""Stetson Chopped,"" I had the opportunity to watch the beautifully arranged salad of couscous, arugula, tomato, cheese, pepitas, corn, salmon, and currants come together before my eyes.  Never one to be wowed by a salad, particularly one with a mayo based dressing I will admit that the presentation and composition of this dish did intrigue me enough to take a couple of bites and while indeed a salad I could just as easily make at home I really did love the variety of textures and flavors hiding beneath a dressing that although hefty was quite refreshing with notes of basil, onion, garlic, and lemon beneath the slightly sour creamy tones.

If the Stetson is not Cowboy Ciao's most fabled item then my main course most certainly was, a dish described simply as the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  Again topped with chopped avocados, cheese, and tomatoes and consisting of ""mucho mushrooms (including cremini, button, oyster, cepe, lobster, black trumpet, shiitake, morel, yellow foot)"" in ancho cream over double-cooked polenta the pan fry would prove to be many things, not the least of which being the richest vegetarian dish I've ever tasted.  Beginning first with the mushrooms - a blend I have a hard time calling exotic as each can be found at your local Whole Foods - I will admit that the variety of flavors and textures were truly impressive, particularly as they related to the hearty and complex sauce.  With each bite a different experience depending on the balance of mushrooms and vegetables this was exactly the sort of dish I love though I really could have done without the polenta - a thick gob that was so wet it did nothing to soak up any of the sauce and as such tasted like a wet sponge in the middle of the dish.

Having requested some bread to assist in sopping up the rest of the ancho cream (bread that is 'baked to order,' largely flavorless on its own, and an unlisted $2 for three meager rolls) John would arrive as my friend was finishing his salad and I was sopping up the last of my sauce to ask if we would be interested in dessert and with my love of bread pudding well documented I selected ""Bread Pudding Overboard"" which arrived on a large plate in a relatively modest portion. .  Beginning first with buttery brioche - the sort they should have served instead of those dinner rolls - nicely soaked in caramel custard and dotted with dried cherries, craisins, and pine nuts the steaming hot bread pudding was of good quality and firm texture; a good but not stunning representation on its own.  Moving next to the toppings - a trio of brown sugar streusel, praline cream, and American Oak ice cream the overall effect was sweet, sweet, and sweet - not inherently a bad thing, but a bit of overkill.",2011-10-31 03:09:57

The grounds of the Wigwam are quite lovely. Unfortunately, we saw more of them than intended because we had a terrible time finding the restaurant on the resort grounds. We had to ask several employees for help until we found our way through the labyrinth. I half-expected to encounter a minotaur or David Bowie. 

The ambiance of the restaurant was extraordinary. We sat by the doorway and overlooked a lawn where they were setting up for an event. The weather was perfect. The attentiveness of the staff was impressive. Our water glasses were kept full and we were regularly asked if we wanted more bread or if we needed anything else. 

The bread basket was delicious. I'm a bread snob and a home baker, and this was very good bread. To start, my husband ordered the Caesar salad while I had the house salad. My salad was good, though not extraordinary; I can make similar at home. My main course was the Scottish salmon with pumpkin risotto and Brussels sprouts. It was very good, though there were very few Brussels sprouts; I was glad I had the salad for more vegetables. The pumpkin risotto was a delight--perfect pumpkin flavor without being overwhelming. The cut of fish was good.

My husband had the ribeye. He enjoyed it, though he didn't hesitate to say that the steak at Fleming's is far better. Fleming's has set an awfully high bar there.

I had one of their signature cocktails, the Litchfield Lights. It was good--spiked pineapple juice.

We didn't partake of dessert. The selections didn't interest us.

It was a pleasant enough place, but I've had better food for a much cheaper price. If I wanted good farm-to-table cuisine I'd be more likely to visit a place like Palette at the Phoenix Art Museum.",2014-02-24 21:29:01

This place just opened a few months ago, and if you blink you might miss it (it's located conveniently next to the 'Metro' at Bridlewood Mall) and they certainly don't advertise enough, but it's a hidden gem in Scarborough for bubble tea, and is absolutely DELICIOUS.

The Good: Great, friendly service in a convenient location (right at the corner by Bridlewood Mall).  After being here the first three times, the lovely staff behind the counter had already memorized my order. I come here pretty often now just to buckle down and study - it's great because it's a calmer ambiance, but it still has board games, too. The bubble tea and tapioca quality is great and is served in a surprisingly sturdy cup - we're talking, like double the strength of a Cha Time cup, but still recyclable. Double win. I've tried a variety of their drinks and have never been disappointed - from the original milk teas to the slushes, smoothies, and sodas, everything is just delightful.

Try:
-Their original milk tea bubble tea (I like mine with tapioca/coffee jelly.)  The quality is really good and refreshing
-Their hokkaido milk tea
-Their passionfruit slush
-Their passion fruit or strawberry soda with jelly! * (This is my brother's favourite and I don't think you can get anything quite like it anywhere else!)

The Bad: Very late in the evening, about an hour before closing, they sometimes run out of tapioca. This hasn't happened recently, though, so hopefully they've fixed it!

The Ugly: Nothing. Love Easy Drink, Easy Go. Definitely easy, and I hope it's here to stay (because, as a customer, I definitely will be!)

Bottom line: Try this place out. Whether you're a fan of Coco's or Cha Time, you'll dig the bubble tea here. I love the home-y feel to it and the fact that it's made with 'love' (is that cheesy to say?  Cha Time just feels like a crazy bubbletea making machine...Easy Drink does a better job, I'd say, quality-wise). It's also a great study spot or a place to bring your friends - they open regularly and stay open pretty late (until 11), and is one of the few places where you and a group of friends can find good seating without having to wait!",2016-07-26 05:19:00

Rum Runner is a dive. They have spruced up the place with nice HD TVs hanging over the bar, but the stink of dive bar (read: Marlboro) is still there. The bartenders are usually pretty nice, though lately it always seems like there aren't enough of them. Sitting at the bar, you can order food there as well. Hope you have two different cards or forms of payment. The food comes on a different tab than the alcohol you purchase. I understand the Badger Cafe and Rum Runner are technically two different entities, but they've been there for years and years. There has to be a way to consolidate the tabs.

When they do call a waitress over, expect to wait. A while. If you thought there weren't enough bartenders, there sure aren't enough waitresses. It's ONE. Usually, I get an older lady who is nice but a bit out there. She'll talk super fast, laugh at a joke you didn't even know she made, and be gone in an instant. She means well, I think? 

Some of the food is still pretty good for a divey bar but has gone downhill a bit from what it used to be. Burgers and wings are the definite ways to go. Burgers are pretty cheap (around $6-7 after you add your fixins). It's all laid out on a card, so it's actually very easy to see what all the options are and the costs. It's also mind boggling how Rum Runner will routinely get your burger order wrong by missing something. Yet, these are still your better options. You COULD try the Krab Cocktail like I have in the past, but you would probably want your $1 back. I've also ordered clam chowder once and got a bowl of Progresso clam chowder that was cold in the middle. Stick to bar basics.

The Rum Runner is a dive but I have spent a lot of nights in there. It's definitely gotten better. It's a livelier crowd nowadays. When you want some cheap beer and cheap burger and no place to go in particular, Rum Runner should be your stop.",2016-02-12 16:53:13

So I was introduced here from a girl at the front desk of the Hotel I stayed at. So yes, this would make this my first time experience. I need to go back to thank this girl for her recommendation.  Here's Porque!

Customer service: 5/5
Honestly, I've had some amazing service, but I must say, EXCEPTIONAL service can not get better than this.  Our server Brendon was beyond OUTSTANDING, I can't find a word to describe the experience.  

He was accommodating, patience and most importantly, super cool.  I messed up and ordered two sodas so Brendon picked one up for me, he totally didn't have to do that, but he did.  Even one of the head manager Peter came by to introduce himself.  All I can say is WOW!

Quality: 5/5
This is probably the tastiest Rib Eye steak I've ever had.  It was tender, juicy and omg! full of taste (highest quality taste).  The corn, dessert and salad was all equally outstanding.  

Quantity: 5/5
Super generous and humungous portions.  But guess what? I ate them all cause everything was so good.

Atmosphere: 5/5
Absolutely cozy, perfect temperature and perfect music in volume. You can actually hear each other and enjoy the music at the same time.

Price: 5/5
My usual rule, quality food plus outstanding service equals PRICELESS! 

Tips:
If you enjoy spicy like myself, you can get Habanero sauce on the side. It makes a perfect combination with the salsa. By the way, Brendon brought it to me voluntarily without me having to ask. What a way to finish my night after a long day. 

This is a MUST STOP place next time I am here in Phoenix. Thank you for the great experience Brandon and Peter.",2018-07-27 02:17:41

First off, it's conveniently located downtown, with some nearby street parking or a garage right behind it.  The decor inside is very cute, with some old pots and pans scattered near the front, as well as some interesting home-made art.  I really appreciate their mission of giving the profits to the homeless.  

The food was very good.  For the starter, we had the fried oysters, which came with a cocktail sauce and a bacon vinagrette.  They were delicious, and I am not usually a fan of oysters.  I had the fried chicken, with roasted carrots, mashed potatoes, and pan seared cabbage.  The fried chicken was awesome, and all the sides were quite tasty.  The bread they brought to the table had the perfect texture, more crunchy and chewy toward the outside and soft in the middle, with just a hint of sweetness.  They served with real butter, and it was fabulous.  My partner had the fried flounder and mac and cheese - both of these were also great.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  For dessert, we chocolate peanut butter crunch cake.  The cake itself was just ok, but they served it with some really delicious vanilla bean ice cream.

I feel bad complaining about the service, because our server was really nice and it wasn't entirely his fault.  We arrived there for dinner on a Saturday night at 6:00, and we left the restaurant at 7:48.  Our appetizer arrived quickly, but then our food order got lost.  Because our server was so busy, it was almost 7:00 before he realized we had not gotten our food.  He rushed the food, and we got it about 10 minutes later.  He apologized to us then and as we were leaving.  It look another long time before he came over to get our dessert order.  I think they were understaffed, because everybody was really rushing around.

I would definitely come back again, because the food was very good.  I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt about the slow service.

The ordering system is different. You are given a book and you write what orders you want down. And then rip the pages off and give that to a server. Wish we had instructions cause we were confused at first.

The decor is really pretty, keeps you occupied while you're waiting for food.

Breakfasts are usually nothing special. The menu was huge but it was mostly sweet this and sweet that with more sweet on the side. Service was good, we all got our orders in pretty good time.

It is in the container park downtown, which is already a great spot to check out while in Vegas as it is downtown, has unique and artist shops, a massive playground with a tall slide, and other restaurants. 

The hot dogs are great with a variety of untraditional toppings and sauces that turn a hot dog into a gourmet and reasonably priced treat. I always make sure to get the potatoes chip topping and fry sauce for my fries. 

The sitting area is very limited, with most spots accommodating only two people. There is a vast outdoor seating area they share but most the tables don't have any cover from the sun. So, if the weather is really hot, cold, or raining it may not be the optimal choice. 

This is a order at the front, get a number, and have a seat restaurant. And you can be in and out quickly. Parking may be difficult to find, so you will likely be walking and paying, which is usually fine because the downtown area is interesting to be in.

The food stall is still up down the street, and if you have the option, go there because it is slightly better than he storefront. Both are good options though.",2017-03-05 00:52:05

The tomato mozzarella sandwich is served warm which was a nice surprise and it was pretty flavorful. I enjoyed both items overall and they are definitely things I would get again.

I got to have a bite of the cinnamon cream cake as well and it is just as sweet and buttery as I remember. It is definitely worth a try. The slice that they give you is enough to share.

Four of us dined here together around Mother's Day. Though the restaurant is located in an inconspicuous section of the south hills, I was surprised how spacious and recently renovated the interior of Katana is.

We made reservations here and were promptly seated when we arrived. We started with Crab Rangoons, which I really enjoyed. Two of us ordered hibachi while the other two of us ordered Sweet & Sour Chicken. We were told that the Sweet & Sour Chicken was not made in house, but I thought it was tasty. Our portions were large, and it was definitely the bestSweet & Sour that I've eaten in some time. 

We watched a hibachi show that a young chef put on for the large group of 12 or so sitting next to us. He joked around with the children, gave everyone shots of sake, tossed around his utensils, and set an impressive fire. Our hibachi chef was just for the four of us and was not quite as skilled. He spent less time entertaining and made a few mistakes when tossing around his utensils. I did get some pretty great pictures of the fire he set though. Both my husband and mom liked their dishes, and my mom was really impressed by the quantity of food that she received.

If you have time and are in the area I'd recommend checking this out. If you're a huge fan of the movie then definitely check it out! 

The house is pretty small overall- like it was in the movie. They have it decorated with replicas of everything as in the movie. You're allowed to touch everything inside as well. They have the leg lamp there you can pick up and take pictures with too. Also the famous BB gun. You can also go upstairs and put on a bunny suit- but I didn't do that lol 

Apparently though- you have to visit the house with a tour guide  I mean- don't get me wrong, the guy was very informative and pretty funny but the talking was just way too much. After the first 5 mins of him talking- I totally lost interest in the rest of what he was saying. Just seemed a bit dragged out. And you can't do anything or go anywhere in the house until they are done talking lol I will say this though- when they say ""take a seat"" in the living room when you first walk in- just do it because you're gonna be standing there a while lol 

The tour itself of the house took about 10-15 mins after the guide was done talking. After that you go outside and then they have a museum across the street with the actual movie props that you can't touch. I decided to skip that part and just go buy souvenirs from the gift shop which is very large actually. I noticed in the gift shop there was a list of times for the tours and it says at 4:30pm you can do a self guided tour lol Keep that in mind if you just want to walk in, touch crap and leave lol if you're a big fan of the movie though- I recommend taking the tour and seeing the museum too.",2015-12-22 16:43:31

It was tempting to fill up on the bread basket filled with pretzel and rye bread sticks, Parmesan crackers, and teardrop sourdough boules, but I restrained myself and saved room for a half order of the Spicy Mambo Salad ($7.99) and the Sauteed Shrimp appetizer ($18.95). Everything at Mastro's is fairly expensive, so these dishes were a great way to test their quality without spending a ton. The Spicy Mambo Salad was essentially a Caesar salad with horseradish in the dressing, and being a huge fan of horseradish, I very much enjoyed it. I always ask for light dressing (or dressing on the side) in less expensive restaurants because more expensive restaurants generally know how to dress a salad properly, and Mastro's was no exception. If anything, the salad bordered on verge of being under-dressed, so if you are a fan of heavy salad dressing, I would ask for extra. The sauteed shrimp were nothing less than wonderful, and hit the spot for my seafood craving. The huge shrimp were cooked just right and served over a broth that tasted like a lobster bisque reduction rich with butter. The cheesy garlic bread croutons absorbed this liquid on one end, but remained crunchy at the other, providing some textural contrast. It was fun to dip all the different kinds of bread from the basket in the sauce as well to see how they each paired differently. Overall it was a really successful dish, and because the shrimp were so plump and the sauce so rich, it was certainly enough for my entree. One item that I might have tried as a side had I been with someone, however, was the lobster mashed potatoes - they looked fantastic. I wasn't too disheartened by not getting them, as I still had a terrific meal that was plenty filling.

I wanted to order their signature butter cake dessert, but because it was $14 and I was full by that point, I decided to pass. I'm sure it's enough for two to three people so maybe next time I go and I'm not by myself I'll splurge and get it.",2010-05-16 16:24:56

When politely approaching a waitress expressing my negative opinion on the sandwich.. her response was ""The issue is that you don't like it, not a problem of the sandwich"" I was amazed by her lack of professional people skills and how rude she was. Soon after I was offered by another waitress to order another dish. Which I I did. I requested the quiche Lorraine with fries. Luckily it was a bit more pleasing to my belly and palette. Fortunately, the raspberry tart I have ordered was outstanding! A lovely balance of sweet and tart with a generous amount of fresh raspberries.

qHTAi_MLGBqqSWLR2ohqSw,RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,4,12,3,8,"So Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining has been opened for awhile, but I only just noticed it very recently.  It is a Japanese and Korean DIY BBQ restaurant, where you can order items a la carte or from one of their many preset combinations.  It is a similar concept to Yagu (on the West side) and many other J or KBBQ restaurants in California.

Based on reading the past reviews (very helpful in convincing me to drive to this side of town for just a meal and go then back) and the photos posted for this business and comparing it to my first hand experience here, I can deduced that the restaurant has experimented with various promotions before settling on their current all day Happy Hour promotion.  Gone are their lunch special menu or previous versions of their HH menu.  Now you get 1/2 off selected beverage items and discounted menu items.

The food I was served was good and tasted even better when cooked properly and to the exact doneness that I want.  And since it was not AYCE, I did not felt subconsciously compelled to overindulge during the meal with the final destination dangerously close to meat coma station.  Price was reasonable, not cheap when you add everything up, but you get good quality for the price.

The server was very friendly and helpful, as was the owner or the restaurant manager/model (yeah, she definitely exudes the essence of Gangnam style). The restaurant itself looks very nice (posh with well executed design and decoration).

Suggested party size for dining here is up to 4 per table, as you have to share the grill built into the table.  Don't wear anything that you don't want smelling like it was generously sprayed with the delicious smell of sweet BBQ smoke after you leave or have a change of cloth for going back to work. Best time to come is after work so you can take advantage of their HH drink specials without having to feel like an alcoholic for the 2nd part of your work day.

Bulgogi, Korean Prime Short Rib and the Kurobuta (Japanese Pork) Sausage was what I ordered to be grilled and is what I would recommend to others trying out this restaurant.  No free banchan here, but you can order their Kimchee and Pickles (both are $0.00) to compliment your meal.

I always stay at different places in Vegas depending on what I am doing, location, and who I am with. I will admit I was worried about staying here considering the very inexpensive price. However, I would say overall I got exactly what I would expect at this price point and enjoyed my stay here. First of all, the staff here is very friendly and go out of their way to take care of you.

I was trying to describe this place to someone the other day. I tried to say it was like Dave and Busters, but with a dance club/live band area and bowling. But that's really not doing it justice. It's actually pretty cool! 

While I wouldn't say the food would blow anyone away, we had some light appetizers (chips/gauc and pretzels) and they weren't bad. Plus, the tap list wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I expected Bud, Bud Light, Miller Lite... you get the point? But they had that and seasonal brews. Sadly the one that sounded good, the Leinenkugel vanilla porter was tapped out, but I'm lame and settled with a Yuengling. I love love love when it comes out ice cold... you can just tell when it's badly tapped. 

The bowling was $45 per hour before 10pm, then went down to $35. But you can have 6 (and maybe 8??) on one lane, so it really wasn't too high a price. We bought two hours and got in 2 games and a little bit of another. It's nice that they have servers coming around to take your drink orders too, so you don't have to go to the bar. 

I also enjoyed the live band. And I'll note, I'm not a live band person, but they weren't bad! They played everything from 90's pop to current hits like Blurred Lines and LMFAO. In between sets they had a DJ playing. 

I kept thinking it would have been a really fun place to come as a teenager. Something to do instead of getting into trouble:) Plus, it actually seemed like a good amount of families were there playing games in the game room or eating dinner. Plus, it would be fun to watch big games at because they have massive TV screens in the bowling and bar area.

The place was busy, as has been the case of 2 other times I have been there. The joint serves beer and pub food with lots of TVs, great place to view games. Unfortunately, the atmosphere is what you pay and go for, not the food.

I had the special, a Greek Chicken Pita. Sounds pretty good right, chicken, feta, olives, etc? The problem is that it wasn't made with care, as the pita came soggy with olive juice dripping through the bottom, as if emptied from a can. Worse, there was an olive pit in the pita, which I bit down on, OUCH. Apparently there was a warning somewhere about olive pits... my question, why serve something with pits that can't be easily distinguishable? Great... you put a warning, can I warn you that I may not pay you if I don't like the food and walk out?

The fries are flavourful, but it looked like they were rushed. Straight out of the frier and onto our plates... fresh is good, but usually you want to run the fries through paper towels or something to get rid of the excess grease. CAH fries apparently come with an extra serving of oil on the outside, glistening!

Other folks had the veggie pizza, a grilled chicken salad, buffalo chicken burger, and the fried fish. I think I probably got the worst of it, the other food looked like standard pub food. I had the buffalo chicken burger before and I would rate it three stars. To be honest, if CAH cooks spent 1 extra minute per plate to actually clean up the presentation, that would earn them 1 extra star. KISS, Keep It Simple & Stupid. Nobody walks into CAH expecting miracle food, charge me $10, make me a good burger. Chicken pita would've been fine and good, why add olives and turn it to disaster, honestly, just stupid.

Boy was I wrong. The venue is located a few blocks off East Carson, the main drag in a quieter area. The venue does seem a bit cramped when you walk in and unlike most of the sports bars on East Carson there were no flat screens where I could watch the Steelers game that was on at the time. Take into account that this was a little after 5:00pm so it had just opened and wasn't that crowded.

I ordered the Polpo alla Griglia, grilled octopus salad, the sardine, which came with two whole sardines with raisins and toasted pine nuts, and for dessert, the tiramisu. The octopus dish was delicious as was the sardine dish. Although the bones were a bit annoying, the dish was still divine as I loved how the bitterness of the sardines went with the sweetness of the onions, raisins and pine nuts. The tiramisu was easily the best I have ever had. It was so moist but not at all overly sweet. During my meal I also got to chat with some other clientele seated next to me one of who was also a food and restaurant connoisseur like me.

I think what separates this place from all the rest in the area is it's locale, it's interior and how it lacked the televisions thus only seeming to cater to those interested in the venue and the cuisine, and it's authenticity in that there seemed to be nothing Americanized about it...pure Italian.

We had a bottle with a crack in it & didn't even know until it was too late. Unfortunately, the water leaked all over my carpet & kitchen (due to placement of machine). This happened right at our second delivery & as we were down to the very last bottle of water. I called to cancel services due to this issue. Customer service was happy to cancel, but never offered any credits to the bill from this cracked bottle. They told me to call back about my final bill, as a credit would be issued for returning all empty bottles we received once they were picked up by the driver along with our machine. Upon calling back, the customer service agent had to manually input the bottle credit.",2018-06-19 22:25:51

We came in for a birthday dinner and we frankly disappointment with everything except for the service and our chef's entertainment ability.

The portions are a lot smaller then I remember. 

My food was just mediocre. I don't know is that do to the chefs ability or the quality of the food they are working with. Also they apparently only honor their birthday discount program on Mon thru Thurs, which i understand is a normal policy for regular coupons but said birthday was actually on a Friday and they we couldn't use the discount even though we were actually there on the date of the birthday, This is just a bad policy. 

I used to really love Benihana would would gladly choose this restaurant over the other Japanese steakhouses that have popped up recently, I don't think i can do so anymore. we had a much better experience at a different restaurant a for a lot less also.

This used to be a slightly more upscale location, now it is not much better then an Applebee's but still have the upscale pricing. I do realize that you are paying for the show as well as the food, but when the food is sub par and the environment is lacking, that pricing just feel like a rip off.

That being said,  it's a great froyo option in the nw.  Especially if you're not interested in just fruit.  Actually it's probably better to go else where if you are just after fruit but I personally like the mix of ""bad for you"" toppings on a ""reasonable"" frozen treat.  Marble slab is delicious but swings a little far to the ""omg,  I can't believe I just ate that"" while some other froyo might not satisfy an intense need for a treat.

The reception of this location has been amazing.   Quite late on a weeknight and there is a line out the door and around the store (30+ people?)

Either they are struggling to manage the location or they are slammed all the time and I'm guessing it's mostly the later.

I really dislike the size of the containers... because they make you over serve yourself.  A reasonable serving looks so pathetic in the bowl.

For a group of 6, it came out to $60 for 2 hours, so $10 each, which we paid at the beginning.

The room fit us all comfortably. There is a HUGE selection of Korean songs (even a lot of recent ones), but not so much for English. They have a lot of notable English pop songs, both old and new (ish... maybe from like 3 or 2 years ago) but if you're looking for anything really recent, you won't find it here.

Nevertheless, it was a very fun experience. Or maybe I'm just saying that because of the alcohol we consumed and the group of friends I was with.

It was quite expensive for alcohol: 2 smirnoff ice and a bottle of soju for $32, but once you start taking a couple shots, the price doesn't seem to matter anymore...

If I'm ever in the area and other karaoke bars are closed, I would come here again, but as a first choice, maybe not.

Foot massages are a dime a dozen in Chinatown and some (if not most) try to upsell despite the low advertised prices in front of the store. Good Foot Spa thankfully doesn't do that and the price chart clearly reflect the services and length of time you're going to get.

It can be hard to communicate with some of the masseuses but they will bring you a price chart and you can point to the length and service you want. During the massage they will ask if the pressure is too hard/soft etc. For the basic $20 foot massage they will start with your head, face, and shoulders while your feet are soaking. After 15-20 minutes they will rub your feet and legs getting the pressure points. Last but not least they will have you turn over and will work on your back and shoulders.  

Not everything is perfect here. Sometimes it can be loud and I've had masseuses talking to each other in Chinese before (annoying).

It can be a harrowing, tiring experience, unless you venture upon a GEM of a store as I did, recently. Boho Furniture on Dean Martin Dr in Las Vegas is such a gem, with good customer service, wide selection,  and fair pricing. 

To me, as a consumer, and former retail salesman, after entering a business establishment,  the most important first impression is how soon I hear the words, ""Hi! How may I help you?"" I received such a greeting within 2 minutes of walking in the store. The Manager of the store greeted me that way, even though she was helping another customer at the time. Then her daughter helped me until her mom could help me. I appreciate that approach so much. This store exudes happy, healthy customer service. I was helped by both Manager and her daughter in an excellent, helpful manner. Very friendly, caring approach by both, something I appreciate highly. Rare these days, too, in retail, I feel. 

This is a pretty store, decorated very nicely, and growing, too. This is a clean, nice place. This delightful experience is a pleasant environment in which to pursue your sofa or chair, or bed, or lamp, table, whatever else you wish. 

I wanted a sofa to replace my old wreck so I asked about those. I was offered a choice of three, which also, to me, is a great way to sell and is how I did it with cameras or lenses in the photography store I managed. This approach makes it easier, not harder, to make a choice, and, to me is good salesmanship. The one I chose wasn't the most expensive or the least expensive either, but the one in the 'middle', a nice comfortable sofa which wanted. The manager urged me to sit on all three, also something I like; i.e. to try out what I am looking at to buy. 

This store features a wide selection in each category of furnishings for the home.   While I was there, I also asked about 'Hitchcock Chairs', a type of rocking chair made in Connecticut since the 1700s. The manager said she would find out about them for me. 

 I had a lovely experience, and, will visit and shop at this wonderful furniture store again. I recommend this highly. Thank you.",2015-01-19 08:42:03

We started with a few things to share, and the Salade de Scarole aux Lardons et Oeuf Poche was probably our favorite.  It's a salad but there's an intense smokiness from the bacon and that poached egg was perfect.  Warm & cold.  Awesome.

I went with Steak Frites.  Good options always.  Steak was cooked to my liking without any issues.  I upgraded my fries to truffle fries, which is a must.  No bearnaise sauce here with the steak frites.  If you want the sauce, the Steak Bouchon is the one.  I tried a bit of my friend's Poulet Roti, which is roasted chicken, and made me wish I got the chicken instead.  Tender and juicy.  

A few got the special, which was a steak roast.  It was suppose to be medium rare, but all came out medium-well.  They sent it back but then we were told that they were roasted in batches, so they offered to swap it out with rib-eye cooked to medium-rare.  They waited for awhile before the food was served, which was a bummer.

I came here for lunch with my sister because we both been dying to go here.

Yes! The place is super cute and adorable, like something staged out of the Secret Garden with books and vintage pieces everywhere, cute teacups, a swing and a slide. 

My sister and I spent about $60 on 2 croissant sandwiches, a crofin, 2 coffees and 2 iced teas to go. (We like to try a bit or everything. We were also very hungry.)

Things we liked:
The green tea latte was actually really good. It had a good amount of matcha flavor. It was just right.

The crofin was super good! Nice and flakey and light and it was filled with that rich coffee pudding that really packed a punch of flavor in it.

Not too crazy about:
I was bummed that during lunch they don't serve the desserts that everyone hypes about. Except for the rainbow cake. That's why we came. PRO TIP: if you're coming for dessert, go around 2pm when the desserts come in.

Croissant sandwiches: If you're buying this because you didn't eat all day and the night before and you just need some protein in your life, get it. But over all, it's like any other croissant sandwich you eat at any coffee shop. So $13 for a subpar smoked turkey Gouda croissant is a pass for me when I can go to another cafe and buy it for $9. ‍ I recommend spending your $13 on the pretty desserts.

Cappuccino with honey: Maybe I'm a novice at mixing flavors with coffee because I drink everything black or a cap plain. However, I decided to be adventurous and try honey with cappuccino. I tried the honeycomb one in Kitchen Tabled Squared and I loved it. The coffee's flavor profile did not mix well with honey, so it ended up tasting more tart than bold and strong with sweet. ‍ 

Jujube Green Tea: This flavor just had me confused. It tasted like barley tea with a sweet date flavor and sliced nuts in there (it looked and tasted like sliced almonds, but they're dates?) The marinated dates threw me off because I just wanted to drink tea, and not drink tea and eat nuts at the same time. I didn't realized that's how it was going to come out until they served it to us. 

The service does deserve merit. The staff is friendly and warm and they clear plates constantly.

I'd come back to try the dessert, but my takeaway was that it's a cafe you go to if you need a place to really work, socialize and take photos for Instagram. It's a place you go to try out and see what the hype is about, but not necessarily a place I'd see myself as a regular at. We were just underwhelmed.",2018-07-18 18:14:46

Let's get the unpleasant things out of the way first. The naan is actually pita bread cut into quarters from the local Harris Teeter or Trader Joes. The rice is hit or miss, this time it was ok. So your carbohydrates base is lacking a bit, but let's get onto the good points.

The food was pretty good. I've eaten Indian around the world and this is not as good of Indian food like that you can find in London, or India, or even New York, but for Uptown Charlotte it is probably the best. The price is just right, the food is good, and the flavors will curb your desire for Indian food.

The purveyors are your ma and pa type of shop looking to make an honest and fair establishment that isn't trying to gouge you.

My Dishes: 
1st time..
·Rice and fried veggies- my first time -  Good, wasn't impressed.

2nd time..
·Fried tempura- sweet potatoes, zucchini, & potatoes- Delicious! The sweet potatoes were decadent, much better than the regular potatoes. 
·Egg noodles with Brown Sauce- not so good, one bite and I was done. 
·Zucchini, broccoli, and onions in a Brown Sauce- incredible!! Loved it!!! Yum! 
· White rice- very good! Nice and Sticky!!

3rd Time..
*Note to self and everyone else*
       ·Sir Fry = Regular Brown Sauce
       ·Brown Sauce = too sweet, similar to teriyaki

Polly came to the rescue and helped explain how to order what I like next time. 

·House Ginger Salad- Excellent!
·Ended up with the Stir fry- broccoli, zucchini, onion- was mediocre this time.  


My friend's Dishes:

1st time..
·Tuna - A massive plate! She said it's a 10!! She compared it to when she had the Increadible Tuna over seas. Love at first taste!

2nd time..

Top Must-Get: fried instant noodles
Top Regret: hainanese chicken

It's hard to stand out in Markham's oversaturated Hong Kong style tea time meal market. Blue Ocean doesn't do anything bad - it offers a fairly typical menu with alright prices - but short of the fried instant noodles, no dish really wowwed me.

First off, the seating arrangements come across as a little cramped. It's not a huge space, but they pack in quite a few tables - if you don't like sitting with strangers, you might be out of luck (although from what I see, it's not THAT packed mostly.)

They offer two kinds of complimentary soups and I always get the cream one - it's pretty solid here, perhaps a bit thicker than other places (which is how I like it!) Quite good!

I have two meals that I judge these kinds of restaurants on: hainanese chicken and Portuguese sauce chicken.

The Hainanese chicken was not at all impressive. In fact, it was downright disappointing. Chicken lacked flavour, rice lacked flavour, and portion size was severely lacking.

After that, my friend kept wanting to come here for lunch, and I didn't have a better suggestion, so we kept coming and I just kept trying new things... Nothing really stood out until I stopped the fourth day and said ""bro, can you order me what you get?""

Instant revelation: the regulars who come know what to order.

I got the fried instant noodles and they were GOOD. Flavourful and lasting taste in your mouth... Savour it. It transformed this from a forgettable experience to a pretty solid lunch spot. 

I'm not a huge fan of their breakfasts, but my friend has gotten that a couple of times and seemed to really enjoy it.

For their baked noodle specials, they are not shy about loading it up with cheese, and I appreciate that they don't cheap out here.

All in all, I have got to ask my friend to order again for me next time as well (something different!)",2017-02-10 15:05:49

It is located in the food market next to Jerk Joint, so with a roof over your head, you're eating in a cleaner and shaded place compared to the Dundas branch, which only has outdoor benches on a rundown path.  

The service is quite quick for freshly made chicken: you wait about 5 minutes.  I ordered the original and the nanban boxes here.  Both boxes came with purple rice, radishes, and three pieces of fried chicken (regular sized box). What makes the nanban box different are the pan-fried onion slices and the white sauce (I forgot the name, but it tasted like ranch and tartar sauce).  The rice sometimes had harder chunks, so it suggested that it wasn't freshly made rice.  Also, the box was mainly stuffed with rice and there are no rice substitutions here like a salad. I would call it quits for the carb-conscious. The chicken was another problem.  My bf found the chicken to be of low quality and I found the breading to be too thick, though smothering it in sauce did help to make the chicken skin more palatable.  The nanban sauce, with its strongly flavoured sauce and soft onion slices, was the best box out of the three I tried in total from Gushi (I tried the Japanese curry box at the Dundas branch). However, at five dollars a pop, I still don't think I will be returning because of the non-existence of substitutions for the rice, the lack of vegetables, and the thicker breading.",2017-08-08 17:56:42

We got 2 different salad options as sides as well . They don't have cheesy corn but do have a cheesy fondue which works great with the beef almost like a Philly cheesesteak when dipped into the cheese .

Not sure how I feel about the location change for 2018. Maybe bigger outdoor space which means more people, not sure if I'm happy about that.

You have really no idea what restaurants will be each day when you buy the tickets right on opening day things can change.

Of course we had to sit on the small patio, but the food made it all worthwhile!  And our server, Hailey - best server for sure!  She took the time to explain the whole menu to help my date with her gluten-free choices.  Plus she had recommendations that were awesome!  

We had the garlic shrimp skewers (totally tasty!), shrimp ceviche ( in coconut milk!), Dancing Tuna Roll (taste was so good, I wanted to just keep it in my mouth!) and the Guacamole Stack (great concept that really works!).  

Can't say much for the decor on the patio, but at least it was warm.  Hopefully next time I'll get to eat inside!

But they also play a lot of Christmas music; more than anything else on the planet I hate Christmas music.

I realize it's a process and when I smoke my own meat it's obviously going to be juicier right out of the smoker or after a brief rest, but I feel like I showed up to a family bbq 2 hrs after the food was served and am cleaning up the leftovers.

The restaurant is sectioned off into booth-like table arrangements to create a more intimate setting. Although the place appears fairly small, there is additional seating in an adjacent room.

Unlike many Japanese restaurants closer to where I live, this one serves a la carte options.The menu is extensive and I noted they have quite a few yummy sounding options for maki, set courses, as well as sushi and sashimi platters served on those fancy wooden boats. Our chicken teriyaki set meals came with 9 pieces of assorted sashimi and some sushi. The chicken was moist and flavourful and was drizzled with a nice teriyaki sauce . It was served atop a bed of sautéed vegetables (although proportionally heavy on the onions). This was preceded by miso soup, another soup with noodles and broth, as well as salad. The sashimi pieces were thick cuts of fresh-tasting fish. To my disappointment they put wasabi in their servings of sushi (as opposed to having wasabi on the side), but I suppose I should have mentioned to the wait staff that I preferred it without wasabi. Our meals also came with green tea ice cream. The prices are reasonable, especially considering the sizeable portions. 

Besides good food and a nice quiet environment, what really sets this place apart is the attentive service. We called 10 minutes before arrival to reserve a table and it was ready when we arrived. The staff were very friendly and attentive throughout our meal. And when hubby forgot his iPhone at the restaurant, the staff were helpful in locating it and had it ready for him when we returned 20 minutes later to retrieve it. As sad as it is to say, I'm not sure one could say the same would happen at many other establishments. For this reason as well as the decently priced delicious food, we will be back when we find ourselves in the area.",2018-01-10 02:16:33

I usually have lots of luck with the Activewear department because the stock is plentiful and often clearance items are available which is a bonus for me; not like I need any more workout clothes, but the discounted clearance  definitely is difficult to skip and I often find myself buying way more than I need.

Well, this is the new business in the old Krispy Kreme spot.  I was excited when I saw something new was opening and couldn't wait to try it out with my 2 daughters who both love Asian food.  We decided to stop by for dinner tonight since it just opened either today or yesterday.

Let's start with the Pros:
1. Friendly staff
2. Delicious food!

My daughters both ordered the children's orange chicken with white rice ($5.99 each)  Their dinner was a perfect portion size for them each with lots of chicken and other vegetables.  The chicken was really good, not the overly deep fried stuff you get from the other Asian place over on 27th Drive near Mountainside.  (That place has more fried coating than it does actual chicken).  They both loved their meals.

I ordered Chicken Lo Mei (soft noodles) for $7.99.  It was delicious as well!  I normally order Kung Pao Chicken with rice, but I'm glad I decided to try something new today.  I would definitely order it again.


And now the cons:
1. I know this is dumb, but I have a huge pet peeve about businesses that have grammatical or spelling mistakes.  It just looks unprofessional.  And hand written signs, too.  They had a sign inside that said, ""Please wait for seatting.""


2. I think it's a bit overpriced/expensive.
It's tiny inside and I think I was expecting more of a take-out place.  There are only 8 tables inside so I really wouldn't think of this as a sit down restaurant.  But their prices are comparable to PF Changs (from their website)
PF Chang's Lettuce Wraps $7.95
Hong Kong's Lettuce Wraps $7.99

PF Chang's Kids Sweet & Sour Chicken $4.95
Hong Kong's Kids Sweet & Sour Chicken $5.99

Some of their other main dishes are about $2-$3 cheaper than PF Changs.  I would say the majority of Hong Kong's dishes range from $9-$12 each.
There is a huge difference in the decor/ambiance of going to dinner at Changs or coming here.  Don't get me wrong, the food is yummy, I just was a little surprised by their prices.


I would definitely come here again.  However, with the prices as high as they are, I wouldn't come here often.",2012-05-30 05:04:49

A big lake full of ducks and geese surrounded by grass and quite a few big, shady trees,  There's a lovely running/walking/biking track running in a big loop around  the lake, which always seems to be getting plenty of use (especially since it's part of the green belt).   I've been coming here for 7 years, and it's always clean and lovely!

There's a small playground for kids, a little pagoda for parties (not sure if this needs to be reserved or anything), plenty of picnic tables, and even periodic little stretch/workout areas along the track (like a pull-up bar).  

It's a popular park, especially on beautiful weekends, but it never feels overcrowded.  It's well-lit after sunset (not well enough for reading, of course, but you can see your way in or out and on the track).

There's a smaller parking lot on Chapparal as you approach Hayden heading West, but if the lot is full, there's plenty of parking on Hayden and Jack Rabbit, in front of the soccer field. 

It's a wonderful place for people-watching: kids, dogs, frisbee games, runners, bikers, birthday parties, fishermen, picnics...

I still prefer Minh Anh to any pho in the city but this will do in a pinch if you are out for lunch in the eastern suburbs of Cleveland.",2012-12-05 23:38:37

True, I had super high expectations given all the positive word-of-mouth...also, every time I tried to make a reservation for an upcoming Saturday, they were fully booked. I ended up reserving a table a few weeks in advance, which just added to my expectations of greatness.

Homemade ""naked"" mozzarella - yummy but a little tough to cut through; not as soft/creamy as I expect fresh mozzarella to be. (However, bonus points for the dollop of jam and the generous pile of sea salt.)

Margherita pizza - so thin they give you special scissors to cut it! The pizza (flavours, crust) was just okay, nothing special.

Meatballs with fettuccine - the meatball was quite tasty; pasta was a bit forgettable. (Tip: For dynamite Italian meatballs try Seven Numbers uptown on Eglinton.)

On the plus side, the portions were very generous...my companion and I split the pasta/meatballs and they offered to divide the dish in the kitchen and serve it on separate plates (love that). When it arrived, it looked like two full-sized entrees.

Sangria is excellent.

TIP: Even though the address says Yonge St, the entrance is on Gerrard.",2015-03-19 18:41:30

You gotta be careful when trusting locksmith businesses due to the possibility of those scammers out there.  Mike German arrived on time and immediately showed me his sheriff's ID and license which made me feel a lot more comfortable using his services.  He quickly replaced 2 locks for me and was even nice enough not to charge me for rekeying one of my old locks which really needed to be changed out instead.  He also gave me 2 extra key copies free! Mike showed a professional and honest character, and his work is of high quality because I could easily tell how much more secure my new locks are compared to the old ones!

This was very average but for my first visit the price was great because we had a ""buy one entree get the second free (up to $8.00)"" coupon. Which was great, but for a buy one get one for only up to $8.00 it seemed silly because essentially all their meals are in the price range of $10-$12.

The place itself is huge and they have a cute country like theme with a train running on tracks above your head throughout the whole restaurant. Although right where we were seated, as we looked up to see the train pass by, you couldn't help but notice some cobweb on the ceiling.

On yelp they have the special to where you check in you get a free banana nut muffin, so we were excited to get that. It was a SUPER moist muffin, really tasty with some butter! For brunch I ordered the Santa Cruz burrito (chorizo sounded AMAZING for today). It was a mix of onions, peppers, eggs, chicken and chorizo covered in sauce, then served with a side of their Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. The potatoes were really tasty and crispy. The burrito itself was just so-so. I was REALLY looking forward for some chorizo but I couldn't taste any! And upon further inspection you could BARELY see ANY inside, it was all chicken and egg. Big let down.

My friend ordered their Grandma's Biscuits and Gravy, and although I didn't get to try it, I heard no complaints. Our waitress was sweet and accommodating, if I go back I think i'll try one of their sandwiches or pancakes, no more burritos from here for me.",2017-06-18 02:17:27
jvVLojFZz7Nb-imO3AKWvw,qrOXWSK-bpf24dLWnTx29Q,3z6IFHo3pPU5jaKtVyAqUQ,5,4,1,2,"Cheyenne Dental is conveniently located in a strip mall / shopping center off of a major highway.  It is very easy to navigate to and find with it's large signage in front of the office.

Upon arriving, I was greeted by the receptionist who I must say was very nice.  I had to complete some standard paperwork and then immediately proceeded (escorted by an assistant) to a chair in the back.  Through this process, I noticed that the office was very clean, modern, yet comfortable at the same time.  Perhaps I was influenced by the calming sounds of the floor-to-ceiling running waterfall in the front lobby. 

I started off with X-Rays.  It was the standard procedure so there isn't much to highlight here other than the friendly service from the assistant.  From there came the cleaning.

In 90% of my previous dental visits, I often have the problem of hygienists trying to strike a conversation during the cleaning.  While I don't mind good conversation, I prefer not to have one while my mouth is wide open and I have tools in my mouth.  In fact, it's physically impossible unless you are a ventriloquist.   

The hygienist at Cheyenne dental was respectfully aware of this and proceeded with the cleaning while I watched Mission Impossible 4 from my chair.  It was actually a relaxing experience versus my previous dental visits.  She did take the time and effort to educate me on things I haven't been advise on for years.  She found the right balance to be informative and not intrusive.  During the cleaning, Dr. Tounian would come in and occasionally check in on me to ensure I was comfortable.

After the cleaning was complete, Dr. Tounian came back in, sat down, and explained a number of things that they discovered from the X-rays and cleaning.  While the feedback wasn't negative, he offered recommendations on preventive care in order to  avoid issues in the future.  I expected him to try to ""sell"" additional services to me as my previous dentists have, but that never occurred.  Rather he offered proactive advice which was really helpful.

Overall, this was perhaps my most positive dental experience in my entire life.  I want to highlight the word ""experience"" because that was what it truly was.  It didn't feel like a transaction or just another appointment like my previous visits at other dental offices.  I've since come back for other services such as teeth bleaching and my experience was very consistent.

I highly recommend visiting Dr. Tounian and his team at Cheyenne Dental for all of our dental services.",2012-08-16 09:14:42

I had the Aragosta di Salmone ($27). The description begins, ""Salmon and Lobster pair delectably well"" but the only lobster you get is in the bisque that drowns the entire salmon steak. The bisque was really good, but it was very tomato forward and not very lobster. Plus I really enjoy salmon and i like the fish to speak for itself. I think the dish would have been better off if the bisque were a a mist; not a waterfall. But that's just my personal take on how I like salmon. Doesn't mean the dish was bad. 

My mom had the Pork Loin Chops ($20) and my bf had the Rib Eye ($27). 

They also had Osso Bucco ($37) and Cioppino ($35). 

I'd give this place a higher rating if the prices were slightly lower. After a salad,  three entrees, two glasses of wine, and a desert, our bill was $109 before tip. 

This place is kind of old Vegas. We went on a Wednesday night and there was a female lounge singer singing old Billie Holiday jams and such on a small stage in the corner. She had a great voice, but the setting was kind of inappropriate. I think if you're to have live entertainment in a low key restaurant, there should be more upholstery everywhere to dither out the sound. Otherwise, the sound is too direct. 

The singer was a sweet heart, though. She interacted with the audience and half the crowd there seemed like locals. 

They also had a free raffle for a gift certificate for Onyx. It's a nice gesture, but kind of corny for a place that serves salmon for $27. 

I thought the color palette of the decor was kind of schitzophrenic, too. 

The ladies bathroom was huge, though. For a space you could fit two stalls and a sink in, it was a private bathroom. One john, one sink, and a chill out seat, all to yourself. 

There's about twelve tables and booths and a bar. It's a pretty small space, but seems large because it's a perfect rectangle, unbroken up. There's also a bar that seats about eight. The place was at about 40% capacity when we went. Pretty good for a wine and dine joint on a Wednesday night. 

Our server was immensely patient, professional, and gracious. 

My assessment in a nutshell is that I would go back if I didn't have to pay for it. The food was good, but beyond what I'd like to pay for that ambiance and meal.

AqepQ_o6qD8mysMexB3ONw,XcFm9v7a1UgCaLn8zCNltw,QFqtVX-lyZQgVHQrG-dhlg,4,3,1,1,"I've hesitated to write this review until I ate here at least 3 times. 

The first weekend they were open, I ate the Race Track Dog and fries. It was very bland and at that time they were slicing the bun down the middle so essentially it was just 2 pieces of bread on each side of the hot dog. They have since gotten normal buns. The fries were delicious but I wish they were crinkle cut. 
    The next time. I tried the Fried Catfish plate. Now, usually, you can't mess up something like this but the breading sure did. I don't know if they were having an off night  but the breading for the fish and the Fried Chicken was very bland. You could taste the flour in it, it's almost like they didn't flavor it enough or fry it long enough to cook it out. The hush puppies were nothing to write home about either. 
     The next few outings consisted of their Small block and Pig Wings ( that everyone has been raving about) .  The Burger was awesome. Plain with cheese because that's how I feel a burger should be. Just so you can taste the delicious flavor of the meat complimented with a slice of melted cheese. The Pig Wings, were what everyone claims they are...AMAZING! I LOVE any type of slow-roasted Pork and these definitely lived up to the hype. I think it has been the best addition to the repertoire of Bryan and Jimmy yet. I only wish they served a non-vinegar based BBQ sauce with it. You only have the option of Honey Mustard or the above mentioned sauce, which I've never been a fan of. 
     Now, I've had an obsession with plain potato chips ever since my first bag of Lay's at an early age so I'd like to consider myself knowledgeable in this area.   The Diamonds' homemade version was delicious, better than I've ever made at home that's for sure. 
     I'd give this place 5 stars on atmosphere and drink specials alone but the not so great experiences with the food knocked it down to 4.        
     For a hangout spot, I believe it will be just as great as what the Penguin was, especially late night. It already is for me.

There's a lot of hype surrounding Mesa Grill, and it lives up to it. Mesa Grill has a reputation for its food having rich, Southwestern flavors, and its impeccable service. 

Appetizers - Sophie's Chopped Salad: Not the best introduction to my dining experience, only because the salad had chickpeas and olives -- not a fan of these -- that weren't mentioned on the menu. A coworker had me try her Blue Corned Pancake with Barbecued Duck, now that was good! If I hadn't known it was duck, I would've thought the meat was pork. 

Main Course - Smoked Shrimp Tacos: Our waiter praised these tacos and strongly encouraged me to order them, which I'm glad I did. Along with the tacos there were three condiments: guacamole, tomatillo salsa, and a mango habanero salsa that wasn't burn-your-tongue-off spicy. The shrimps tasted fresh and were well-seasoned that the sauces were unnecessary and just made eating a little messier --- the mango habanero salsa will make your white napkin turn orange before you're done with your meal.

Dessert - Chef's Choice Chocolate Pudding: A chocolate pudding topped with chocolate mousse, topped with chocolate toffee -- yep, that's a lot of chocolate! The pudding reminded me of the Jello pudding cups that you can buy at the grocery store. Adding more chocolate toffee pieces or even some fresh berries would've saved the dessert from being just average. 

Service - Exceptional and attentive.

Long a Mooresville staple,  the spacious new digs sees Lancaster's spreading south, near Exit 18 and the Northlake Mall area.

The interior is what you would expect from a southern bbq and wing joint in the heart of NC: NASCAR memorabilia, farm equipment signage such as John Deere ads, and an impressive collection of signs denoting various gasoline brands.

It definitely offers a bit of old-school charm and nostalgia, harkening back to simpler times when a community was a community and gas was well under a $1. But I digress...

The food, as always, is typical Lancasters. Great bbq, great wings.

My only problem is that there are no signs directing you at the Complex where everything is.  Since then we have figured out exactly where the dog park is and the best place to park (hint: turn onto Carver Rd and you can park in the lot right in front of the dog park. The Tempe Police substation is on the corner).

The dog park itself is absolutely huge-much, much bigger than the one we used to go to in Ohio. The times we have been to the park, there have been about 15-20 dogs which is a good amount. There are benches for the owners to sit on, as well as some picnic tables. Additionally, there are bags for dog poop and faucets for water, so if you forget bottled water it's no problem.

Came here today with my friends and ordered the Cotton Candy with Tiffany Vanilla ice cream and the Honey Comb with the twist (Green Tea & Tiffany Vanilla ice cream). I was so eager to try the blue ice cream since I thought it was cotton candy flavour but to my disappointment, it was only vanilla ice cream dyed blue... 

The Cotton Candy came with colourful popcorn, a swirl of an ice cream of your choice, as for me it was the Tiffany Vanilla then topped with a puff of lychee cotton candy and a chocolate cookie straw. The cotton candy surprised me when I took my first bite. I mean, LYCHEE FLAVOURED COTTON CANDY?! WHAT?! It was so tasty with the ice cream I find. However, you gotta be careful eating this thing. I mean, with a mountain of cotton candy you just can't dug into your ice cream right away. Either you set the cotton candy  aside or eat all the cotton candy first then attend to the ice cream. As for the ice cream, it didn't taste much like vanilla as I find the flavour of vanilla to be lacking. It tasted more like cream however, I did enjoy that it was not overly sweet. The popcorn was tasty as each colour has its own flavour however, you'd have to eat these things quick or else it'll become soggy from absorbing the ice cream.

The Honey Comb wasn't that much different compared to the Cotton Candy. It came with a small  piece of honey comb and waffle cracker drizzled with honey. I was quite disappointed with the ice cream yet again. Like the vanilla ice cream, the green tea tasted more like cream. I found that the green tea flavour in the ice cream was lacking. Secondly, the honey piece was quite small...small as in two loonies combined. So, how does honey comb taste like? Well, of course you'll taste the honey and as the honey dissolves you're left with a piece of tasteless waxy-like substance in your mouth. The waffle cracker was really good! Tastes just like the egg waffles you get upstairs in the food court. 

Overall, I didn't find anything special about their dessert except for their toppings and presentation. Pretty pricey imo. The Cotton Candy was close to 6 bucks while the Honey Comb was close to $7. I feel like they should be more generous with their toppings especially with their honey comb and waffle cracker. Additionally, they should offer more variety for ice cream since they only have 2 flavours to choose from. 

Will not be trying their soft-serve unless they have a new flavour or the flavour in the green tea and vanilla improves. However, I am still interested in trying their drinks to see what those are like.",2016-01-31 01:09:05

Yet there are very few Filipino restaurants even though there is a huge Filipino population.  This place opened up in the Heartland Town Centre food area (i.e. Britannia and Latimer Road).  

Decor: 3/5 - very clean and modern

Service: 2.5/5 - I came here during it's first week and there were a few kinks, which almost had me running out the door.  While the cashier was very friendly, I was very apprehensive when I saw someone cleaning the place with a mop at around 5:30 pm.  I figure most cleaning should be done at around 2-4 pm, when it's not prime eating time.  The second thing was that when I ordered a combo, it took the cashier a while to figure out why their POS (point of sale) device wasn't sending the order to the kitchen.  She then had to be told since it was a ""combo"", there's no need.  Despite these two hiccups (which would scare me off if it were a long standing establishment), the cashier was very helpful in explaining what everything was. 

Food: 3.5/5 - okay I don't remember what I ordered.  I believe it was chicken and pork adobo and some type of pork ""sausage"" with rice.  The adobo tasted like a sweet curry chicken, which I thought was okay.  However, I really loved the pork ""sausage"".  I wish I could describe or compare it to something, but I can't.  It was a good mix of sweet and salty. In addition, the rice was very fragrant. 

Verdict:  It's very different than Chinese, Thai, and Indian food.  It's not spicy.  But it has similar curries but sweet.  Try it out.  Seems like it's good for takeout and would be great hangover food too.",2013-12-08 22:17:34

So eventually things calm down and I decided to try again. It helped that a friend convinced me to go again.

There are good things and bad things about Heist. The food is still amazing.They do amazing Sunday brunches here!

The bad thing is if you're going to a brewery, you expect the beer to shine more than the food and this is where Heist falls flat for me. They had 5 of their beers on tap. There were two other beers listed on the menu that sounded interesting but one they were out of and the other didn't get tapped until the next day. So ordered a flight to retry Heist's beers.  None of them stood out as good. All were belgian style except one - a breakfast stout that was really heavy on the coffee and not so much on the beer.

The food options were good but still with flaws.  The pretzels and beer cheese were beautifuly presented but the beer cheese was watery. Thankfully it didn't affect the taste.  The cuban sandwich was good but needed more pickles and more mustard.  The parmesan fries were ok - nothing really stood out about them. I wish they would bring back their homemade tater tots.

So I would still come back here for the food but I'd probably order something other than beer here.",2016-06-12 17:47:25

So far, I've tried the green chile pork flatbread and the Ron Swanson flatbread. I may have ordered the Ron Swanson because of the title, but I was lucky that it was actually decent too. I did like the green chile pork flatbread a bit more but I always like the southwestern fare since it's got a bit more spice and flavor. 

Two of my friends had the Impossible Burger, which I got to try a few bites and the description is right. It does eat like regular beef patty. I was pleasantly surprised.

As far as drinks go, I've had their Old Fashioned. At the other Bevvy location in old Scottsdale, I've had the rubber duck shots. All are enjoyable in my book! 

The atmosphere is always lively but as another reviewer said, it's a bit more laid back at this uptown location. Our waitress, Shanelle, was awesome on Saturday night. I think she was the same one we had last time too. She's always so friendly and fun!

Went on a Thursday night, normally a busy night in the city, but it was just us and a family of 4. 

The one VERY odd thing right off the bat was the loud, blaring TV show which was a POLITICAL show. MSNBC Chris Matthews to boot! I absolutely HATE that guy, and I find it in very poor taste that a restaurant would put on such a blatantly partisan political show! NO matter what side of the aisle you reside on, politics has no place in a restaurant. Period!

Thankfully, the waiter agreed to change the channel on the TV in the restaurant front so as to prevent any regurgitation caused by the crap coming from the screen! But he still decided to keep the political channel on in the back, but at a lower volume. Very strange indeed.

Anyway, enough of my digression. As far as the FOOD goes, it was quite tasty and fresh. The waiter was very soft-spoken and friendly, and explained all the food choices, but only when ASKED. He didn't volunteer to explain what is what, but we were already familiar with Ethiopian cuisine. I wonder about people who are NOT that familiar......hum. 

Started off with a cold appetizer which reminded me of Italian Bruschetta, Ethiopian style. Very fresh tomatoes and onions, all wrapped in their Injara bread. If you're not familiar with Injara, it's very similar to a Crepe, but ""spongier"" because this is what you eat with. And don't be shocked that NO silverware is provided. You eat everything with the Injara bread by breaking off pieces and picking up the food. It's quite fun, albeit messy.

For the entrees, we had the Beef Tips and Chicken Tips, which is served ""family style"" right on a big platter over the Injara bread. This way, you can sample all the yummy goodies, and ours came with chickpeas and collards. This food was very savory and spicy, but NOT spicy ""Hot."" I actually wish it had been more spicy hot, but it was good nonetheless. 

They have a very limited wine selection, but it's only $6 a glass for Argentinian Malbec which was decent.

Overall, this is a good place. I was underwhelmed by the service, and the LOUD political TV show on was too much. The owners need to rethink how to better present their wonderful cuisine in a more professional FOOD atmosphere. I think we'll try ""Red Sea"" to compare.",2012-03-02 15:35:08

I guess we were early birds getting there a little after 8 because the place started to have people trickle in within the hour we were there.

To no one's surprise, I ordered the Chiliquiles Rojas. To this day, I still crave the Chiliquiles Verdes from Gallo Blanco, so I was just dying to find out how different or similar the taste would be. To tell you the truth, I couldn't really tell much difference, because I really loved the Chiliquiles Rojas. It definitely had some spice to it, but not the type that you can't handle. It's just packed with the right about of flavor and punch. 

The Huevos Rancheros had a similar sauce but different enough that if you wanted to try both, they'd almost complement each other in a way. This one had no meat though. I personally like having protein, so I ordered my Chiliquiles with chicken. 

We also ordered a side of Quesadilla Synchronizada, which is actually just a cheese quesadilla with Oaxacan cheese. 

Funny enough, even though I took Spanish for so many years, I am embarrassed to say that I asked what the Verderas Crudas was. My particular menu did not say the translation directly beneath. The waitress just looked at me questioningly and politely answered, ""Those are fresh vegetables."" Ah, but of course! Of course, I wouldn't know what veggies in Spanish was. I am a meatatarian.

The wife and I had made it point to dine off-Strip as much as possible to experience some of the great spots that only the locals know about.  As a result, we made our way off-Strip for dinner on a Thursday night at SPARROW + WOLF.  The chef, Brian Howard, was the chef at Comme Ça, a place that we had really enjoyed when it was open at the Cosmo.  We arrived around 6PM.  We were greeted with a smile by the hostess as we walked in the door.  The dining room was fairly empty, but we requested to sit at the bar.     

Sparrow + Wolf's cuisine was eclectic American but with seeming Japanese influences.  While we looked over the menu, I started off with a We Can Prevent Forest Fires ($14) made with Dalmore 12-year old Scotch, Cynar, Vida Del Maguel Mezcal, lemon, pine simple syrup, and garnished with a flamed rosemary sprig.  It was a delicious mix of boozy, bitter, goodness with a pronounced, but balanced smokey note.  Although the standard menu looked great, we decided on the Chef's Tasting Menu ($125/person) with beverage pairings ($45/person).  Since there wasn't a printed tasting menu, it's likely safe to say that it changes frequently, if not daily.  Most, if not all, of dishes that we received didn't appear to come off of the regular menu.  Every dish that we received seemed to be made fresh to order, incorporating high quality ingredients, and beautifully presented.  We found every course enormously satisfying.  The beverage pairings were spot on with the food and generous.  Service throughout was friendly and attentive, making us tourists feel like local regulars.  Sparrow + Wolf was an excellent start to our week of dining in Las Vegas.  Locals have probably already gotten the word on this place, but I'd highly recommend it for those adventurous (i.e. willing to leave the Strip) out-of-towners looking for an amazing food easily accessible from/to the Strip by Uber or Lyft.",2018-02-02 17:45:33

- Sun, 11/04/12

This beautiful, tranquil La Madre Springs Trail (3.5mi RT from Willow Spring Picnic Area) is a popular one for locals and visitors alike, especially during autumn and cooler winter/spring months. 
- The hike can also be extended to 6+miles via the White Rock Loop, whose upper trailhead is near the top part of La Madre.

I love La Madre Spring trail for its tranquility and the magnificent, wide open wilderness! Its moderate climb is good for body and soul! During autumn and winter, La Madre Spring is my favorite trail to hike on!

Now, you can skip reading the following, just GO TAKE A HIKE(!) on this nice, quiet trail, and/or the White Rock Loop. You'll like it, too, I'm sure!

YELPY DETAILS: 
- La Madre Springs is very popular but never crowded; short in distance but could be a bit strenuous, for its constant climb of 700+ ft elevation gain over a short distance of ~1.7mi.  

Its base trailhead is conviently located at the beautiful Willow Spring Picnic Area off the ""13mi Scenic Drive"" [- Follow the Willow Spring sign, turn RIGHT into the 2-way drive].
- The trail is a 1.75 mi long
[1-way], moderately pitched, wide-open, gravel/dirt ""road"" (covered mostly by egg-sized rocks), with spectacular views of the La Madre Mountain Range and valleys it towers over below! 

At the ""end"" of the trail is the famous La Madre Spring, where you'll find a beautiful, SMALL ""Pond"" covered by a layer of green water plants. This pond is formed by the flowing spring, which is not very visible, but you can hear its soothing musical sound! This is really NOT the end of the trail! From here, one can hike further on a VERY NARROW PATH (at times muddy), along the mostly hidden spring, crisscrossing over it a few times, to small water falls. Holwever, over the years hiking, I myself have never hiked far enough to see the water falls.

Yesterday, I had a wonderful time hiking on this trail, happily soaking up the sun and taking in the gorgeous views of the mountains and valleys!  I parked at the beautiful Willow Springs Picnic area, and walked 0.25mi up the Rocky Gap Road to the upper trailhead. From there, it was only 1.5+mi to the spring. The last 0.5mi was a series of climbs on moderately pitched slopes covered with small rocks. It could be a bit strenuous due to the pitch and higher altitude, but it was absolutely worth the climb, especially after you reached the SMALL pond formed by the hidden spring! Although the tiny spring itself was mostly hidden, the SOUND of its FLOWING stream was audible and soothingly therapeutical! 

A young couple told me that some kids told them they had spotted a tarantula around the pond earlier! Well, that tarantula was too smart to stay around for me - it was long gone when I got there!

It was such a gorgeous afternoon by the pond, I took extra time to relax over my trail mix and water before moving on. I walked along the narrow path along the spring for a short distance, but it was too challenging for my tired old legs! I'd have to come back another day to explore further up, where I knew there were a couple of small waterfalls.  Going back down was easy, but those small rocks could make the path a bit slippery at spots.  Do be careful! 

So, GO TAKE A HIKE on this trail and/or the White Rock Loop.  You will see hikers of all ages there, many with pets, and some older ones with walking canes! I am sure you'll enjoy the hike, too! 

NOTE:
- BTW, hiking up yesterday, I saw several pink-colored ""super jeeps"" (from Pink Jeep Tours) climbing up Rocky Gap Road heading up to the summit! It looked like fun! I myself have not taken one in Vegas, although my wife and I did have a thrilling pink jeep ride on Sedona's steep rocky boulders!

I am sticking with 4 stars as a confession of my  personal enthusiasm, but before you go you should probably read the rest of the review.

It's in the old Fuji buffet location, which for many, many years before was a wonderfully tacky and over-the-top Chinese palace with tons of neon outside and something resembling a moat.

The glory of that old place is sadly long-gone, but thankfully so is the mediocre trough-brau that replaced it sometime in the mid-nineties. I never liked Fuji.

So now in its latest incarnation we have the same building painted fire-engine red with cheap-ass looking giant yellow letters and some attempt at an outside bistro area that looks like it will probably remain a pigeon perch. That's a shame because it will probably drive away some customers who might otherwise enjoy what lies within.

And what lies within is a startling melange of foods from not only the Mediterranean, but also India and--with several varieties of Jello--Iowa. They have dolmades, they have pork-chops with a tangy tomato sauce, they have Greek Goulash, they have paneer, they have curries, they have alfredo, and they kebabs that look and eat more like sausages, they have orzo, they have fried rice, and they have several varieties of chicken dishes. And they have a bunch of other stuff. And it is all--as far as I can tell--delicious. 

The chef himself came out to show me around at lunch today. He took great pride in his creations. His accent made me think he was Greek, which would make sense. Greeks tend to go overboard with this sort of thing. Greeks know how to run restaurants. Sometimes they know how to keep them open.

Lunch is $7.99. For kids it's $3.99.

Go in with an open mind and ignore the desolate and half-assed fittings on the outside and inside. Ignore the lack of door closers on the entryway (I had to get up and manually close them twice). Ignore the interior tackiness. Relish in what is on the buffet line and appreciate fact that you can eat your way around the world in this little corner of the Camelback Corridor.

Then go next door and buy a treadmill and some freeweights.",2012-05-31 06:31:21

We ordered an appetizer of crab rangoons, and I got my typical Philly Roll and another special roll from the menu. Everything was great, just as expected. My friend ordered several special rolls including the OMG roll, which was served on fire. The presentation and the actual food were both enjoyably different, and the staff is always friendly and accommodating. Food never takes long, either, which is always a plus.

Through the several visits I've paid to Bean Curd, I've found the environment to be welcoming and warm. It's a great place to chat over dinner and catch up with old friends. The only drawback I've ever experienced is that they don't sell wine by the bottle. It can get expensive for tables of multiple people that would like to enjoy some Chardonnay alongside their sushi, but that's all. Overall it was a very good experience.",2016-10-28 18:19:46

First off if you do not know this place look online or grab a menu before you get in line. They are practically pushy to keep that line moving and under pressure you'll quite possibly forget something or order something nasty to try out...
 I think the way to is the soup and salad combo. For 7.99 you are full or you can share if you had breakfast or want dinner later... depending on your plans.
 We got lobster bisque and tomato risotto, a few turkey sandwiches etc. Both were good, not excellent. I noticed most of the soups are creamy, milky and heavy. There needs to be a tortellini broth or something healthier as a choice too. The sandwiches have cheap deli meat. Everyone liked their food but no one loved it enough to rave about it. A step above Jimmy Johns but I'd still rather go to Panera.
 The cons are the atmosphere is awful , and the parking is tough in that corner. It is very loud like a school lunchroom.  :( And they have these signs all over the place stating ""please don't hold your table"" ... as if! Give me a break if you are paying 25.00 for lunch I say sit your tushie down and relax. You are already getting your own food and drinks...
 So for me this is an _ If I am in the area and want soup and it's a slow hour I might go in and get some soup to go kind of place. But that's about it. No one wanted to go back in that line or that noise again. Not worth travelling for unless its really your bag.",2013-10-04 02:50:41

They also keep the place spotless and they bus your table.

I really lucked out during special bonus back sale.  I picked up an awesome 3 way jacket... part 1 rain jacket with hood, part 2 inner liner as puffer jacket, and all 3 parts together awesome warm coat!  It kept me super warm and comfortable.  The ability to peel off layers was invaluable!  My favorite purchase thus far.  I also picked up a couple pairs capri pants, moisture repellant as well.

My husband picked up a new lightweight rain jacket and outdoor shoes.  Since the trip, he purchased 2 long sleeve water resistant shirts and the packing tubes water resistant as he was camping this month during monsoon season.  He's 6'5 250 lbs and was happy with the xxl shirts & jackets.  He did not pick up any shorts or pants.  Oh yeah, he did pick up some gadgets.

I've been back a couple times and picked up sun dresses.  They don't come in petite, so I did have to hem but was easy to do at home.  I also have a few UPF moisture wicking dresses which are saving me from overheating this summer!  I do have to try on every style of clothing to check the fit, each style fits differently.

As with any outlet store, I think it's important to know the price of items regularly to determine if you think you're getting a good deal.  I like to check online prices before I go anywhere and often have my phone out price checking. I always watch my purchases being rang up no matter where I shop to ensure the price is accurate.

Conceptually, it's salivating - tender and meaty ribs wrapped in layer after layer of gooey mozzarella cheese. In practice though, it's great for the first couple ribs, where the cheese is hot and gooey, and easily wraps around the ribs. While hot, the sweet corn sticks easily to the soft cheese (and in fact, the server will even prepare the first one for each person). However, after they're gone and the heat is off, the cheese starts to get hard, doesn't wrap very well and corn stops sticking... you'll also notice (in sadness) that some of the cheese and fat has burnt and clung to the bottom of the hot plate.

So make sure you eat fast! Fortunately, they're more than happy to help you reheat your cheese and wrap more cheese for you, but it gets quite difficult to find someone once it starts to get busy!

For some reason, they insisted on squishing 8 of us into a booth, and we had to split the hot plates at 3-3-2, instead of letting us have 4 burners and 4 orders of cheese back ribs. With the extra half order, there was definitely 50% more cheese and ribs as far as I could tell, but I'm less convinced for the other sides. At time of review, an order (for 2) was $34.50, plus $17 for a half order.

The other sides were hit or miss. We liked the mashed potatoes and corn, but didn't think the egg was very good at all.

If you're in a large group, be sure to arrive early or wait a long time. Seating is limited and they cram a lot of people into the smallest spaces. They take credit card and will do split bills. No WiFi.

What's missing: the side dishes that Korean restaurants typically give you with your meal. It wasn't missed, it just seemed like a strange omission.",2017-10-24 22:54:27

Here's my story... let me start by saying I'm from the 808- exit 8 home of the best meat jun in Wahiawa Hawaii. With that said i know meat jun and know how one should taste. The meat jun here is not bad at all. Best so far on the mainland. I think the dipping sauce could've been a little better but hey it's still good. 

We arrived here around 2pm on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was busy but glad they had large party tables available. We had 8 of us total. 

The server was very nice and served the table ban chan and boiled peanuts. The peanuts and cucumber kim chee was the bomb. 

In addition to my meat jun order, i had the fried saimin and kalbi. Omg, broke da mouth fo realz. The fried saimin was on point. Lots of flavor and made with fish cake. Yay! 

Although they forgot about my fried saimin, it was actually worth the wait. I'm excited to visit again.

Located above the good ol RM Seafood (Mandalay Bay...would it hurt to put up some damn signs?) And i've waited way too long to write this review so lets just get to the food.

- Bucket of Crispy Fried Game Hen with Bleu Cheese Dip, Buffalo Sauce
The Buffalo sauce is damn good, the game hens themselves were crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. Nice meaty pieces considering they're game hens and all. Also served with shaves of carrots and celery which is a nice touch in both presentation and...yeah i ate them too.

- Jumbo Asparagus Officinalis with Soft Cooked Desert Bloom Egg & Truffle Salt
So this is a side item but it's actually pretty damn amazing. The truffle salt was light, a bit too light for my tasting and the truffle was a bit underwhelming. The asparagus sure was jumbo and the serving size quite nicely. The soft cooked desert bloom egg is just that, the soft cooked (boiled? poached?) egg yolk that offers up it's rich fatty goodness to what ever you dip it in.

- Johnny's Big Dry-Aged Burger with Truffle Cheese, Lettuce, House-made Pickles & Tomato Jam Balsamic Onions
First of all i had this with the Truffle Cheese which gave the burger an AMAZING flavor. Secondly, i dont really like burgers much because they're pretty much a dime a dozen but it's difficult as hell to find a good burger let alone a GREAT burger. Last, for 18 dollars is this burger worth it...the answer is yes Yes OH GOD YES. I'd one of these every meal of the day if possible.

- Rx Guacamole with Duck Fat Chips
The guac is...pretty standard. The Duck Fat Chips...oh god if it wasnt so unhealthy i'd eat them along with Johnny's burger.

- Braised Oxtail Croquettes Dijonnaise with Lemon Aioli 
Mixed feelings about these croquettes. They are very tasty and have a lovely crunchy outside to gooey inside ratio but the individual pieces are so small it's hard to taste everything in just one bite. Well it was for me as everything described is being shared with others

- Moon N Doggies - Two Shrimp Corn Dogs, Cilantro Aioli & Asian Slaw
Didnt get a chance to taste the slaw but the moon doggies were quite nice. The shrimp wasnt too mushy from being ground up and still had some good texture. The cornbread batter was nice and light resulting in a crispy shell.

- Flight of Onion Rings - Smoked Ranch & BBQ Sauce 
this ""flight"" is actually very nicely served on a wire rack model of an airplane with the sauces tucked in the wings. quite an adorable presentation. Rings were good too.

- Lamb Osso Bucco Greek Style with Toasted Orzo, Germolata and Ricotta Salata Cheese 
Lamb wasnt as gamey as i was expecting but still quite tasty. Couldnt really taste the toastyness of the orzo but it went well with the greek style sauce. Not all the bones had marrow but of the ones that did....nice VERY nice

And major bonus points for having the EPL on most of the TVs :) we sat at the bar and had wonderful, friendly service by the bartender. 

The brunch special was biscuits and gravy. I'm a total sucker for this dish and was a little worried when the bartender mentioned Italian sausage. The dish was not the typical southern sausage gravy but was excellent nonetheless. The biscuits were a bit denser than I normally prefer but still very good. It comes with eggs but I was allowed to substitute the white cheddar grits for no charge. My friend swapped the eggs for toast. It also comes with a huge ""side"" salad. The greens were very fresh and came dressed in a nice light vinaigrette which had a pleasant uniqueness to it. 

The other dish ordered by our party was the shrimp cake benedict which also came with the same side salad. My friend thoroughly enjoyed it. Portions all around were large and could easily be split. 

They have a short list of breakfast cocktails, all of which sounded delicious. I opted for the Salty Dog which was tempting given the fresh grapefruit juice promise. It did not disappoint.

I've had a few birthday meals here but recently realized that it's been a while since I last visited.  So that was quickly rectified on a sunny week night.  With the patio opened for the summer, the restaurant almost doubles its capacity, so there was no trouble getting a table at last minute.

Some of my faves here are the Burrata with Roasted grapes, and the bone marrow.  Anyone who knows me would be shocked to find out that I decided to skip the marrow this time - it's such a rich (and delicious) dish, and it was a hot day, so I wasn't in the mood!  Instead we ordered their baguettes and gougeres, and the burrata to start.  For mains, I was happy that the pasta was the Spaghetti a la matraciana;  it's my favourite but I have also had their carbonara which is also fantastic.  The pasta is well-made and has a ""toothiness"" in texture that confirms it is not store-bought pasta.  We also had the pork belly and scallop main course.   Servings are generous, and we were unfortunately too full for dessert.  I love their budino, and should have skipped the breads to fit in dessert.   Oh well, there's always next time!

Service was OK, but less attentive than I recall from past visits.  Perhaps because we were seated outside?  We had to ask for water refills, and had to flag our server's attention for another beer.  Likewise, when we were ready for our bill, we had a long wait before we could catch our server's eye.  Not a big deal, but a little out of norm vs. previous visits.",2016-07-27 04:44:04

So many new options have opened in this area, however I kept my vow to just follow along. Although rare, I wasn't the leader on this day. I was a little heart sunk when our group walked right past Postinos, and a touch relieved as we strolled by Dickies BBQ, and then there it was... The Mad Hatter, I had been there before and it was always empty. Today the place was very busy with a patio extension and extra security. As we made our way through the place we ended up at a  great table on the original patio, smack dab on the corner of College and Veterans Way. The table was perfect, and the company was stellar and that's as good as it got.

Our server was obviously not a regular staff member, he seemed like someone's buddy that just worked on game days. Initial beer orders taken and tiny paper game day menus dropped. The menu was small, with just a few items, a burger, chicken strips, French dip and chili cheese fries. I guess when your expected volume soars from regular days you have to do what it takes to keep the quality coming out of the kitchen. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. everything from the kitchen was barley passable to awful. 

French dips were bland with no flavor at all and the au jus was served in 1 ounce Jello shot cups, certainly not dippable, and the fries with mine were Ice cold. The Chili Cheese Fries were even worse because they looked disgusting and tasted like curry and were smothered in gloppy flavorless cheese. My friend said she was going to eat her burger but it wasn't very good, and the chicken strips weren't finished by a big 17 year old boy. 

All this served with no salt and pepper, no napkins or utensils and OLD broken, almost empty ketchup bottles.

I know this place is almost always slow, It really needs customers and I think instead of turning off 300 people on game days they should try and wow 300 people on game days. Location for us was great and it was a nice gathering of old friends, at least we had that.",2015-11-19 16:21:25

We each ordered the spicy shrimp vesuvio as our main course which was jam packed with flavor. The shrimp in this pasta dish was very generous as well which was a nice treat. Our meal also included unlimited bread sticks and choice of soup or salad.

Also included is your choice of a shared appetizer or dessert so we opted for a slice of triple chocolate mouse cake which was super moist!

My hubby had peach iced tea which was super tasty and refreshing, I opted for plain iced tea.

This meal was great and a lot of goodness for $25!

Our meal was generous and good and I also like the sample of wine they offer when seated.

Somehow, on this of all days, I had a breakthrough and instead of stumbling through my options trying to find the one perfect thing, my wife and I just started ordering stuff. Anything that caught our eye. And it worked. 

We picked somewhat at random, partially based on descriptions, across different sections and ended up with a satisfying array of options. Plates and bowls of the Taiwanese style Dan Tsu Noodles, Vegetable Dumplings, Pork Wontons, Chicken Soup, and Steamed Broccoli were the end result.

The highlights of the day were the Pork Wontons with Mung Bean Noodles and the broth of the Dan Tsu Noodles. I wasn't a huge fan of the Vegetable Dumplings, but I think that was just my personal taste, as my wife did enjoy them.

The chicken in the soup wasn't super appetizing, but that may have been our only collective compliant. On the whole, it was a delicious and satisfying experience. There's not much that can beat a warm bowl of noodles on a cold winter day.

Looking on Yelp, this was the only place around where we were, and thankfully it had 4-stars so we decided to partake.  We pull up and... it's open, but the sign is half busted.  Upon walking in, we notice it is spartan, there is a buffet-style banchan station next to the counter, a couple of tables occupied, and we're thinking ""uh oh"".  A pseudo-cafeteria looking place with cheap furniture strewn around, it did not look impressive.  It's the only Korean around, so we thought we'd give it a try.  There must be a reason a place so devoid of charm has 4-stars, I thought.

We sit and the single lady running the show all by herself comes over and takes our drink order.  She's nice, initially speaks English, then upon noticing we speak Korean switches to the native tongue.  There are 2 cooks in the kitchen, so it's a 3-person operation.  This becomes key because during our meal the place gets full, 8 of the 10 tables filled with around 30 people by the time we leave, and she is still serving all by herself, with nary a confusion about who to serve first and what to prioritize.  What a HUGE difference from lunch!

We order a beef jun (pancakes) and dolsot bibimbap, plus a $1 for barley tea.  Everything is under $10, so it is a good deal based on what you get.  The meal comes in about 10 minutes and we get started not expecting too much.  She brings the side dishes, consisting of kimchi, radish kimchi, squash jun, sprouts, and potoatoes.  Radish kimchi and sprouts were awesome, squash and potatoes were good, and kimchi was very good.  A bite into the jun and... wow, this stuff is great!  The meat looked to be typical brisket meat, but man, the coating was delicious!  I taste the bibimbap and again, it is spot on.  Good but way too much salad and an ample side of rice make the meal complete.

You pay for it at the counter, and again the same lady who serves you cashes you out.  Model of efficiency although you can't expect the service to be quick based on the demands.  They could use another server.  But all-in-all a very satisfying meal very close to those great home cooking you always reminisce about.  It's a big thumbs up!

The menu (complete with an old-school library date stamp) presented a selection of locally-sourced vegetable sides, sushi and sashimi. All items were offered à la carte (ranging in price from $4 to $10) or as omakase (chef's choice).

For those who have never tried, you get some broth, and you cook your own food at your table using the broth. Master Mix starts you off with some basic choices for broths such as pork bone flavor or milky pumpkin but you're welcome to add more seasoning. 

This can be AYCE or a la carte. I think 3-4 dishes = price of AYCE (18.99) so AYCE seemed like a better deal. We were hungrrryyyy. I've had cheaper AYCE hot pot but it's way on the east end in Markham. 

In the back is where all the food is. You help yourself. Grab a bowl and go get some stuff. They have a big section for vegetarian stuff like vegetables and tofu. The other side has mostly seafood. Yes seafood!!! I love their selection. They have all my favourite seafood balls like lobster, squid, and fish. I like their grouper skate wings. If you want meat, they have to prep it in the kitchen. They have lamb, chicken, beef, pork. 

Most of the food is unflavored (not marinated). The taste comes from the item's natural flavors, your broth and any condiments you choose to get. So there isn't much to talk about in terms of quality since it's up to you. Seafood is of course the frozen variety. The cuts of meat are also pretty standard for hot pot. 

For drinks, they have water and free fountain pop. That's pretty good. Most places would charge you per can. 

Chinese hot pot places are not difficult to find. Master Mix is in a decent location. The prices are reasonable. It's also connected to the Tea Shop 168 so you can get dessert and bubble tea.

All in all it's a fine place. It's a very self serve experience. If you want fine dining with a server pampering you, this is not the place. If you want chill with friends or family while cooking food, this is not a bad choice.",2013-10-04 20:31:05

Since it was during Downtown Cleveland Restaurant Week we thought we'd take advantage of that.  If you're not familiar with Restaurant Week, it is a ten day period where restaurants offer a fixed menu (three courses and you usually have two or three choices per course) for a fixed price, either $30 or $40.  Some restaurants also offer a lunch menu. It's a great way to try a place that you might not otherwise afford.  

My husband ended up ordering off the fixed menu and he had the crispy chicken wings for his appetizer, short ribs for the entree and pot de creme for dessert for $40.  I ended up ordering off the regular menu and had a strip steak.  We both loved our food, especially the crispy chicken wings (I made my husband share one with me!).  My steak was very good and came with rosemary french fries that were full of flavor. 

Our server was very nice and our water was always refilled quickly, something I appreciated since that was what I was drinking for dinner.  The restaurant is eclectically decorated and is lots of fun.

Here's the negatives.  We sat on the mezzanine level which was nice.  The downside is to route you need to take to get to this level is pretty out of the way.  That would be fine except that the area you go through and the stairwell is pretty dirty.  If your guests need to pass through this area then at least clean it up a bit.  There were some signs around that said ""Pardon Our Dust"" which is understandable if there is construction but I didn't see construction, just a dirty area. 

Also, my husband's short rib entree came on a salad plate.  A salad plate!  Especially compared to my steak and french fries, his entree looked more like an appetizer rather than an entree.  For $40 (for the three courses) they could at least put the short ribs on a dinner plate with a few garnishes.

Food was excellent - warning that the chicken does come with the bone own (vs. Flock and Fowl which debones it for you), so it requires more effort, but still delicious.  They were missing the chilli sauce, but they readily made some for my friend when asked.

They had HK style lemon tea with free refills!  As we were leaving, they offered to top us off and give us a to-go cup.

Chips and salsa arrived.  The salsa had a canned taste; however, our server brought a corn salsa and guacamole spontaneously.  
I got the chimichangas stuffed with cheese.  They came with rice, beans, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole. Quite good.  My husband ordered the vegetable fajitas with corn tortillas.  He seemed surprised when a plate of rice, beans, lettuce, guacamole and salsa arrived with his grilled vegetables.  He did not use the corn tortillas and appeared to prefer eating his rice and bean plate, along with the vegetables.  My husband stated that the vegetables had no seasoning, but, to be fair, he did not consume them in the way intended.  I did try the vegetables, and they needed salt and pepper when consumed without the other items.  Salt and pepper not on the table, which seems to be a trend with restaurants these days.

Hung out later in the bosses suite making noise, eating snacks, and passing a bottle of Jameson around.
All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, even security was nice about telling us to keep it down. 
We came upon food spills in the hall and vomit in the elevator, the staff were on it and it was cleaned quickly. Everything was kept clean.
We finally escaped to our room, it was very nice and modern with a view of the pool, upgraded toiletries, a mini bar to tempt you into draining your wallet. Comfy bed, we slept like babies or was it because of the booze. 
Fought the hangover in the morning with a shower in their beautiful bathroom, Starbucks run was a must, and a couple Advil. We even got a complimentary newspaper at our door in the morning, that'll be read later in the bathroom perhaps.

We pretty much tasted all the standard fare with a few exceptions like the salmon skin hand roll which was different than any I had tasted in the past. It was a tad sweet which made it taste unique but really good. We also ended up having 1 of each of the desserts and I think my favorite was the black sesame manger.

NbPJKhi33wxJm9sLGoEc6A,PRJMe-RgFnCEhyy7tf3DmQ,JOf872M0OWxX18qp9fTfAQ,3,3,0,0,"Came here for winterlicious dinner 2015 with a group of 8.

The ambiance is very classy chic with cool lighting decor and purple/pink lights. We had dinner upstairs in their main dining area. I was surprised that there wasn't much of a view for being on the 31st floor. I was expecting a canoe type place with large windows where you could see the skyline, but you can't see outside  or enjoy a nice view unless you go to the balcony at the lounge downstairs. 

The service wasn't bad at all. Usually when you go to winterlicious dinners, you expect subpar service, but this wasn't the case. I was quite surprised. Our main waiter was a bit icy, but professional. I asked him for extra bread, but he only gave us one basket when we had two baskets for 8 people the first time around. Our water glass was never empty. There were several servers/ wait staff that came out to give us our food at the same time.  It was kind of cool yet overwhelming to see how many staff served us at one time! It was like an entourage of servers! 

The food was plentiful. I left stuffed. I had the salmon cocktail, which was my favourite dish of the entire meal. The citrus flavours were amazing. I liked the salmon cocktail (A) more than the bbq pork (B) (my bf got that dish so I was able to try it). The skin was good, but it was a bit dry. For our mains, I had the wellington steak. This was nicely plated. The mix of flavours complemented each other well. The steak was very tender. I didn't really like the cheek as much because it was a bit dry and didn't have much flavour (B+). My boyfriend had the pork chop. Presentation was really nice. The pork chop was very tender, but it was a bit spicy, which wasn't mentioned on the menu (B+). We both had the peanut butter panna cotta. This had a rich PB flavour (B), but was too sweet to finish. 

Overall, we had a good experience. For $45 (not including tax and tip), this wasn't a bad choice for a winterlicious meal.  I felt like we got our bang for our buck compared to ordering from the main menu as the dishes ranged from $25-60. I think for a price of $45, you can usually forgo winterlicious at a nice restaurant and order a main and one app or dessert to share, and it will be the same price as winterlicious. However, for this restaurant, I would definitely take advantage of winterlicious.",2015-02-17 01:57:54
iUTYXzLCzo-93UtoPO6M1A,jW37YOkSmBUc4NSf9WF4Ng,_WvEXsx2eZ53lTWHlIx9kg,5,1,0,0,"My wife and I came here for our 26th anniversary dinner, while stating at the hotel, and the experience the staff of Blue Hound provided ranked this dinner among the top three of my life! Through out the staff at Blue Hound was attentive and professional, but also gave us our space. We were seated against a window with views of Phoenix skyline and the old court building, On our table was a card congratulating us on our anniversary signed by several people on the staff (one wishing us Happy Birthday - my wife's favorite).

We started with cocktails and at the waiter's suggestion I had a Lawless (Bourbon, homemade bitters and liqueur and served in a glass that was presented upside down over smoldering tobacco smoke). It was sweeter than I expected but very balanced. My wife enjoyed the Romeo & Violette, choosing only based on the name of the drink. Her drink was not as sweet as I expected but similarly balanced.

For dinner we both had the Chef and Bar Geek out for $48.00 each. This was four courses, of which three were served with cocktails and none were on the menu. The manager, mixologist, sous chef, and chef each visited our table several times. They started by asking for preferences and allergies (non) and then explained each cocktail and course. 

The first course did not have a cocktail and was a cod served with olive oil, fennel and other ingredients the four cocktails now have me forgetting. The dish was mild with tangs from the fennel and spices. I remember thinking that I'd never have order this on a menu based on the description (I need to broaden my horizons), but it was amazing!

The second course came out after we were presented with a watermelon flavored and vodka based cocktail served with the foam of egg whites on top. We were guessing what the course might be based on the drink, but didn't come close. The second course was soft shelled crab on a bed of local sweet corn. We had never had soft shelled crab before so the waiter explained that we did not need to remove the shell, but could just enjoy it all. I enjoy crab, so I'm not sure why I've never had soft shelled crab. All together it was delicious again and also something I'd never have considered reading on a menu. 

The third course came out after we were presented with a cocktail based on the house mulled wine topped with egg whites. It was a heavy and spicy drink (and amazing) so we were predicting beef or pork for the next course. The third course was pork belly topped by a poached egg and served on a chorizo aioli with Mexican spiced corn cut off the cob and a Blue Hound tater tot. I  was glad to see the tater tot, having read about Blue Hound's tater tots here, but my wife never would have ordered it. . In fact, it is here where I am relying on pictures and the third cocktail makes it a little fuzzy. Just the same, it was also amazing and we were stuffed at the end (yeah, we could have stopped and not eaten it all, but that was neigh impossible). 

Prior the fourth course we were presented with an espresso-based cold cocktail that had us guessing chocolate. The desert came after we had had time to let the prior three courses settle over conversation; not so soon as to rush us but not so late as to have us looking for the waiter. Desert was the only course where we received different dishes. I was given a pineapple upside down cake under medjool ice cream with salted carmel sauce (this was the only item of the evening that I later saw on the menu). My wife was given some sort of flour-less chocolate cake with a salted carmel sauce and ... well, I forget the rest. The pineapple upside down cake was just so good. She ate half of my desert and we both had far more than we should have. We both liked her desert, but the pineapple upside-down cake with the carmel and ice cream what just right. 

The dinner came in under $200 for the two of us including tip. To be honest, I'd expected it to cost far more and, considering the quantity and quality of food and service we received, the price was a bargain. Blue Hound will definitely have us looking for excuses to come downtown again. I was happy we were staying at the Palomar so the right ""home"" was just an elevator ride. To do even just the three cocktails (ha! even just!) that came with the ""geek out"" experience I would definitely need a taxi or designated driver home. Thankfully the Hotel Palomar has fantastic summer rates and a room was less than the price of a car or taxi.",2014-06-28 15:01:28

To be quite honest, I was a bit underwhelmed by the food, as I had very very high expectations after reading so many rave reviews and knowing Alo's reputation. I enjoyed most of my dishes, but wasn't really blown away by any of them, and some of the dishes I actually didn't enjoy. Overall, I would give the restaurant a 3.5 (3 for the food, and 0.5 for the value/price point + service & ambience of the restaurant). My friend and I tried 5 dishes and left feeling very very full, and after splitting the bill in half paid around $40 each before tip.

The restaurant does not take any reservations, and apparently they cap their waitlist at 5 parties. Also, they only serve parties of 4 people or less. I came on a Thursday and put my name and number on the waitlist at around 5:40, and only had to wait about 15 minutes before they texted me telling me a table was ready. 

The menu isn't huge, but has a good amount to keep it interesting without being overwhelming. It also has great variety and a couple of really interesting-sounding dishes. We ordered the charred chorizo ($12), burgundy snails ($14), ribeye steak ($28), broccoli ($9), and brussels sprouts ($9). I enjoyed the snails, steak, brussels sprouts, and the complimentary bread that came before our meal (one piece per person) which was warm, fresh and fragrant. The steak was cooked perfectly, but I was a bit disappointed that the bone marrow butter didn't seem to add anything special to the steak. I thought the chorizo was actually too dry (perhaps overcooked?) although I enjoyed the eggplant and halloumi in the dish. The broccoli was a huge letdown, because I had heard it was really good, but found the dish WAY too salty. I think there might have been too much sauce, because by the end of our meal, it had just soaked through all of the broccoli and left it all soggy - we weren't even able to finish it.

I sadly would not place Aloette on my list of favourite restaurants in Toronto, BUT given the price point and sharing-plate style of dining, I wouldn't mind returning a second time to try some other items. The service is stellar, and I felt well-attended to from the second I entered until the moment I was handed my coat and bid farewell. The ambience is also great, because it does feel relaxed and fun, but still classy.",2017-11-18 23:39:25

As I was eating my burger, I realized that there was no cheese or bacon on my burger but didn't make a fuss about it.  The burger and mashed potatoes were delicious.

Two in our group ordered a brie and lobster sandwich and they said it was greasy (it's made like a grilled cheese sandwich) so they used utensils to eat it.

Great pork with some type of light BBQ sauce, just awesome. We also ordered my son's nachos off of the HH menu. The menu says your choice of meats but when my son chose Carne Asada, we were told that the HH nachos only had the option of cheese or pork. He went with the pork, and they were good nachos but how difficult would that be to put on the menu??  I went with the short rib barbacoa tacos ($10) that were very good, I'd definitely get them again. My wife chose the Purist (ground beef, sour cream and cheese). Her tacos were not very good, the meat was WAAAY underseasoned and just not very good. I ended up giving her one of my tacos, which was fine because each plate comes with black beans and rice, very good version I have to add. We also ordered the HH sangria that was $5. When we asked what types they had, our server listed them out and we  both chose the blackberry. Come the bill, we realized our sangrias were off the regular menu and had to shell out an additional $8 between the two drinks.

We've tried their lemon, red velvet, and carrot cake. We're definitely ready to venture out onto their other flavors though. Not because we're tired of the other flavors, but if they're anything like the three I listed, then we're in for a world of trouble and weight-gain. Lord help us. 

The cream cheese frosting is dense and not too sweet (which is what I love most about it, because some cream cheese frostings can get TOO sweet) This frosting really compliments and balances out the sweetness of the cake itself. 

The cake is ALWAYS moist and I LOVE that you can choose to ""decorate"" the little packaging with flowers, ribbon, and a personalized notecard that they print out at the store.

Go to Other Mama because of the food.  So, it goes without saying, that the food and drink offerings are unique, fresh, refreshing, creative and delicious.  Dan (the owner or one of the owners) is on to something different in the valley and special.  Go because you want to support Dan, his team and his culinary creativity designed for the Las Vegas local.  Know that you have to like fresh seafood, oysters, sushi type stuff, ceviche, etc....this is what they are good at and thus the raw bar concept.  

But just when you think that is all they are serving, there is kim chi and roasted shishito peppers that are really spectacular amongst other creative offerings.  There is a huge chalkboard of their daily fresh fish offerings and specials that alone is a feast for the eyes.  

Go to Other Mama because of English.  He is a server.  Jovial, tall, really happy to be working at Other Mama and equally passionate about the food and atmosphere of the place.  It is refresing to see serving staff who have risen to the level of loving where they work because they too believe it is great.  English was attentive and friendly and led up down a great evening experience of their best culinary offerings.  He did not stear us wrong and quite honestly, set the tone for our entire evening. 

Go to Other Mama because of the music.  So opening at 5PM and staying open late, it is clear they are catering to an industry crowd in many ways.  With that, they have thought hard about their uber cool playlist being pumped into the restaurant.

I had been waiting for this place to open for a few weeks and been checking out the menu in the window and online (I'm at the Golds every morning, not just a creepy window stalker). We finally got a chance to go a few weekends ago and man, was I disappointed. They were busy, which is expected on a Friday night. We had to sit in the lobby of the hotel, which we did but was super awkward. We ordered a few drinks and hit the menu. I ordered the deviled eggs and wifey got teh cheese plate. I went with the short ribs with blue cheese grits while wifey went with teh ricotta pizza with pork belly. The apps were done right, no complaints there. I liked the crispy bacon under the mix in the midle of the eggs, nice touch. The entrees, on the other hand, were sub par. My ""short rib"" dish was a large beef rib, and not a true short rib. I'm not THAT picky, but when I want short ribs, I want actual short ribs. the meat was super chewy, essentialy beef jerky on a large stick. The glaze tasted good but after wrestling with the knife to cut off a few pieces, that was it. The grits were also bland, no blue cheese to be found. Wifey's pizza should have read as Pork Belly pizza  and it would have been on point. Now I know it sounds crazy to compain about too much pork belly, but the entire thing was pork belly and there was no ricotta to be found. it was also super salty and just not very good. The server comped my short ribs due to them being inedible, which was very gracious. I had high hopes for this place and will give it another shot. I'm hoping it doesn't go the way of St Francis where it's got tons of potential, but simply can't deliver",2012-06-26 19:11:53

The sound of typewriters hammering in the newsroom. The smell of the first press newsprint. The smell of cigarettes, coffee and donuts on the reporters desks. I had a ritual every day no matter where I lived. Wake. Pee. Make coffee. Grab paper from front door. Sit. Read. Sip coffee and take in the events of yesterday. It was a slow, newsworthy slip into my reality. Now. Not so much. I've tried reading the Republic. Even had a Letter to the Editor published with my take on the 04 presidential elections when I insisted Al Gore would win by a landslide over George Bush. Remember that?

The walnut cakes come in 4 different styles, either a potato or red bean filling, and either a walnut or almond topping. 

Now I know potato as a filling may seem weird but they do some voodoo (probably a great amount of sugar) to it to make it slightly sweet. If you're feeling more of a sugar bomb, definitely get the red bean. The topping, I find, is less important and only imparts a subtle difference to the overall treat. If it is not fresh, it is a little soft, which isn't bad but definitely not preferable. Bring it home, and toast them in the oven/microwave oven for a bit. You will definitely not regret it.

(It's okay, I know it's actually called an Urgent Care Centre). The first time, it was my husband's incredibly inflamed gout in his foot. We had to grab a taxi from our downtown apartment, but with the Sheldom M. Chumir being only blocks away, it's a very convenient location indeed. I was surprised at how long it took in the waiting room...not only for almost 2 hours with Rob, but when they called him in, there was another almost 2 hours before he came back out. This is what makes it like a hospital hehe.

The second time I was there, I had eaten a moldy cheeseburger (not on purpose, I discovered it halfway through eating) so I fell into a tearful fit before deciding to go to ""the Sheldon"" to get my stomach pumped. I went to triage pretty quickly because of my obvious frantic state, but after waiting 45 minutes ""backstage"", the doctor told me I shouldn't get horrible, life-threatening food-poisoning from a little bit of mold (and I didn't).

The third time was for Rob's gout again. If you don't know, Gout is a swelling and irritation of joints around bones, often caused by too much sodium in the diet; it causes severe swelling of the joints, and in this case, it was in Rob's toes, so his foot was so swollen, tender & painful he could barely stand much-less walk! Again, we waited awhile, but I remember them giving him an icepack for his foot.
They also have very nice security staff. While Rob was backstage--as I call it--I decided to go get a treat from a vending machine. I put the coins in, but the chocolate bar got stuck halfway down. It costs $2, so I wasn't prepared to just leave it....so I went to ask for assistance and this young male security staff was more than willing to give the machine one good hit and out it came :) Much appreciated. 
Oh, and there's a Good Earth Cafe at the other end of the corridor and to the right. If you are coming with the patient, I reccomend bringing cash for snacks, an MP3-player, and a good book ;)

If you are the patient, make sure you bring your Alberta Health Card and photo id. Feel at ease, though it seems like days ae going by in there, they do pay close attention to each patient and will get you in on a priority basis.",2011-08-26 15:17:47

Gushing about goat cheese in guacamole.  Obsessive food-love for machaca brisket and carnitas.  It's been said before by many, many yelpers.  But, it all bears repeating.  

Momocho is a gem.  It is a food experience.  Each course challenges the notions you had about Mexican cuisine.  It makes you measure all of those other places: Places that get by with fillers like rice and refried beans, various unintelligible meats in sauces, and the classics... and it makes all of the aspects of ""old"" Mexican food obsolete.  I'm dreading my next trip to quickie burrito joints or to sit-down margarita restaurants.  I know it won't compare to the meal at Momocho.  

The food alone would be worth enduring any level of service, short of being beaten by a rusty spatula, (and even then, I might consider staying for an extra round of carnitas...), but the entire staff at Momocho was exceptional.  Our server, (Brooke), was attentive without hovering.  She was skilled at the art of server conversation, (adding to the atmosphere of the restaurant without being a distraction or monopolizing the conversation.), and was just a wonderful addition to the experience.  

I live two hours from Momocho.  My waistline and wallet are very glad that I'm not a local resident.  I will be going back again, and again, and again.

Tortillas were rubbery and cold. Tortilla chips were thick and tasted greasy, almost waxy - probably due to being fried in the lowest quality, lowest cost fats. Frijoles charros were so salty I felt my blood pressure rising with every bite. Overall, the food simply did not taste fresh and vibrant.

Hi Owner, I hope you are reading this.  Pho at any V-nese is absolutely the numero uno dish that must have no flaws if you want a repeat customer as myself.

The standard for broth temperature should always be hotter than the sun! I should be able to finish my pho with some hot soup remaining.  Brown sprouts and wrinkly basil leaves?! Inexcusable.

Considering the place was below half full, the time for Pho to come out should be fairly quick, not 30 minutes that felt like an eternity.

Its a big time shame.  Your awesome decor can never make up for the quality of food I had last time here.  Its by far the most modern, trendiest V-nese joint I've stepped foot it in.

Coming back from Bartlett Lake, we were all pretty famished and wanted some good barbecue. I would say the Buffalo Chip delivered admirably. Service was fast and efficient, and they also had a rock crawling contest through the local Jeep club happening out back. This provided some fun entertainment while we waited for our food.

I would categorize their baby back ribs as good but not great. Some pieces were very tender, others were a little tough. The beans were unremarkable. I washed it all down with a very large mug of PBR at a very attractive price of $3.

The band was just setting up as we were leaving. I would've loved to stay and listen to the haggard old fella that was tuning his pedal steel guitar, but we had to get home and put the little dudes to bed. I'll make sure to come back sometime on a Saturday night to make a total ass of myself on the dance floor.

And I must say, I was actually surprised that, overall, everything I tried was very tasty. My boyfriend and I were meeting my brother here while he was in town for the penguins game, and it was packed because of a concert at consol that night. We did a lap around the bar and came up empty so we put our name in (45 min wait) and grabbed a table at Uptown to get a few drinks first. Personally, I think Uptown has the better drafts than Blue Line and I was surprised to see there were so many on upstairs that were not on tap downstairs. We were seated at 7pm, which was exactly what we were hoping would happen since the game began at 7pm. Our server came over quickly and got our drinks. We started off with the Poutine which was pretty good. Not overly salty at all (like Station's street was when they were open) and just enough cheese. The gravy was on the side which I lied that touch so we could all put our own amount on. I wish the fries were a bit crispier but it was still good overall. My brother had the buffalo chicken wrap, my boyfriend had a burger, and I had the chorizo and wild mushroom quesadilla. They both liked their meals and mine was surprisingly one of the better quesadillas I've had in awhile. After our meals came service pretty much stopped though. My brother asked for more water twice and never got any. I ended up letting him drink my untouched glass and he also ended up drinking my boyfriend's water as well. The server did bring beer when we asked and a box but apparently could not be bothered with bringing more water.

Just 2 small hic-cups....
1) The birthday girls steak wasn't cooked as ordered.....it was overcooked and on the dry side. She didn't complain though as she ordered it well done (how anyone can do that to a steak is beyond me). Her parmesean French fries were incredible
2) My baked potato arrived with sour cream on it when I specifically ordered it without. It was replaced without question.

What they did right:
1) Bruce, our server was fantastic...warm, attentive and recommended dishes to us. He helped make the evening great.
2) My Chipotle steak was the melt in your mouth kind. It was beyond incredible. 
3) The recommended Pinot Noir was excellent...hints of fig and currants....great pairing for the meal
4) Price point for the type of meal/restaurant is correct....it's not overpriced.
5) As it was a friends birthday and we didn't have dessert (normally it's comped if you tell your server), the waiter comped one of our appetizers instead.

We went on a Tuesday night around 630p and there was no wait. I think we got lucky considering it had just opened for the night but in the hour we spent there it filled up quickly. Once we got inside I could see why there's usually a wait - the place is small! Our waiter was really nice and came by at just the right times. He suggested we order three plates per person. We ordered the tuna tacos, the flatbread, the wings, the fries and a sushi roll.

Tuna tacos ($11); they come as an order of three. We got 4 instead for an upcharge I'm sure. Why have items come in threes when it's a sharing kind of place? Then someone is a jerk for eating the last one and someone feels like they got shorted one. These were good and I would recommend. They're two bites each. 

Flatbread ($10) was dripping with cheese and honey; should just be called a mini pizza. Not very refined and sticky. 

Korean wings ($9) were also really sticky. Don't order these unless you want to get up to go wash your hands.

Fries ($6) were like truffle fries at any other place; similar to the ones at Good Food on Montford. Greasy. Skip.

Queen Charlotte Roll ($10) was probably the best part of our meal; 8 pieces, I've had better but at least this was what we expected it to be. We ordered the fresh wasabi to go with this ($5). About a dime sized portion (see picture)

All of the above plus 1 cocktail and 1 beer came to $72. Is this real life? The quantity of food is very disproportionate to the cost. We should have just stuck with sushi because at least the price on the rolls is proportionate to the size of the item. It was okay but I wouldn't come back here. The reason we finally came was because we'd received a gift card from a friend. In theory being able to order items from different cuisines sounds like a good idea but in practice all those foods shouldn't mix. We both felt off afterwards.

First of all. It lasted an hour and ten minutes if that. Second, I love broadway. But these shows are so outdated. And of the outdated-ness there are so many classics missing. They performed these blocks of certain musicals like Cabaret and Chicago instead of moving on to other shows. 

They could have really put a decent storyline to this. But they didn't. Instead, they had a few narrators that made you feel really disconnected. Some of the narration was by Steve Wynn that made me feel like I was listening to the discovery channel. 

Pretty much every song was your the epitome of a Broadway jazzy show tune. I would have loved to see them slow it down a few times without the cheesy smiles and sequins. Don't Cry for Me Argentina, Memory, I Dreamed a Dream, Music of the Night, Defying Gravity.. These are all ShowStoppers..no? 

There were a few moments I was really excited for a song and overall the show was done very well.

The decor is nice though the music is loud and not always in synch with the decor. Service is friendly but be ready for a bit of questionning when you order (at the bar). I spent a few minutes studying their menu and finally settled on one of their pita sandwich (tofu bbq) and was all proud and happy and full of courage to say it out loud to the waiter... Cue the questionning - half or full? As a combo? With a soup or a salad? Which soup? which salad? what size your salad? Drink? ... Whaaaaaat?! I dropped to the floor in a ball and started crying, please leave me alone, I'm cold and I'm scared and I don't even know who I am anymore!
After a few minutes of heavy breathing, I picked myself up and managed to drag myself to the nearest table just in time for my food to arrive. I have to say, at this point I didn't even remember what I had ordered and frankly I didn't care.
My first surprise was that the pita bread wasn't grilled, making it a bit bland to eat. Then, the sauces were not all that good and the salad was almost in the same state as me. Lastly, in my confused and dazed state, I remembered the waiter telling me that a half pita and a salad was enough to fill you til the next day but I was still starving and I had just spent more than 20$. I don't mind paying more for organic and local especially if it's good but I do mind paying too much when I need to cross the street and go eat a burger afterwards 'cause I'm still starving.",2016-10-28 14:56:46

The 2 stars are for the Pet Valu and the LCBO (both of which, it should be noted, don't actually require you to enter the mall. This is a good thing.) The LCBO looks horrible at first glance, but actually has a good selection of Italian and Portuguese wines and Port. Just don't come in looking for French or Californian wine. The Pet Value isn't my favourite pet supply store (there are a few independents in the Junction that I like better), but they're well-stocked and friendly.

The inside of the mall itself is dark and dingy. There are a couple of marginally useful dollar/electronics/miscellaneous stuff stores. The place where you can get both a stainless-steel off-brand toaster oven AND a plaster statue of Jesus covered in blood is a special favourite. I wouldn't buy clothes in this mall; they all look flammable. 

The PharmaPlus is a decent drugstore for its size. The Price Chopper is dismal; dirty, wilted produce, and stocking is apparently done by poorly trained members of one of the lower orders of primates. They are constantly out of staples, especially if they go on sale.Good luck finding what they do have. The Zellers is just awful. Stock is hard to find, the prices are often MUCH higher than Canadian Tire or WalMart, and they will make things extremely difficult if you try to get them to honour their price match policy.

The parking lot is huge, virtually empty, and if you are walking through it at night, kind of terrifying.

Basically, it's a handy place to pick up wine or cat litter if you live in the neighbourhood. For almost anything else, you're likely better off walking south to Dufferin Mall or West to the Junction.

It will be interesting to see what happens once Target takes over Zellers. That could  make the mall a place worth going.",2011-03-23 07:11:45

When we walked in, we stood at the door for about 10 minutes to be greeted and seated. It was not overly busy, but being that it was 12:30pm, there were several tables occupied by business casually dressed people so it must be a popular lunch spot for nearby businesses. 
I ordered the deluxe beef pho. They brought out a large plate of bean sprouts, basil and jalapeños so I was initially excited that the pho was going to be great. But then it came out and it was not steaming hot. The noodles were all caked up into a patty shape, like they had been heated and just set into the bowl, all stuck together, and the broth wasn't hot enough to finish cooking them. The beef was disgusting. The meatballs being the grossest, rubbery, inedible things. All of the other beef was all fat, and there was only 1 or 2 small pieces of each kind. The broth was tasty, but there wasn't enough of it for all the bean sprouts and noodles. I can usually never finish a bowl of pho, but I ate all of the broth and was left dissatisfied.  
She had the chicken and cabbage salad. She said it was tasty, but way too salty, and not as good as any other Vietnamese cabbage salad - and we've tried a lot.

I have tried my fair share of GTA patisseries that offer macarons in their menu, from this year's macaron day to my own macaron tours (versions 2010 and 2012). Ruelo is BY FAR still the best in the city.  Unless I haven't tried the macarons at a certain place, I have decided to just stick to Ruelo for macarons (with the exception of a lady that sells macs at the Aurora summer market - her pistachio flavour is very good!).

-1 star
 A) They don't have all the macaron and cake flavours available.  They rotate except for the regular flavours. 
B) Their macs and cakes are pricey. Macarons vary from $2.50 to $5.00 a piece. Single/mini cakes are over $5 a piece.

They use good quality ingredients, their cakes are very pretty and the macaron shells are the right texture. My fave mac flavours are creme brulee and salted caramel. Their Ruelo flavour, both macaron and cake will satisfy any chocolate lover.

Ruelo gets a solid 4 stars.

Our server was sweet.  Bless her heart, though.  I asked for a Sauvignon Blanc, and she brought me a glass of red wine and said, ""here is your Sauvignon Blanc"" (I think that it was a Malbec).  The beautiful thing was after I placed my order, I regretted not ordering a red wine.  Telekinesis, perhaps?  Then, bless my heart.  I happily drank that red wine and then, I drank one more.  
My man ordered the fish tacos, which he described as ""ok.""  My portabello mushroom sandwich?  He should have ordered that.  It was served on this soft, squishy bun, complete with roasted red bell peppers and some kind of special sauce reminiscent of Thousand Island dressing.  And the accompanying fries?

Service is superb; right as I sat down the waitress helped bring me water. Many restaurants wait until you ask them so that was nice. The girls working there are also super friendly and cute, they can help you recommend some starters if you are coming here for the first time.

I have never had a bad meal here, at the same time, though I have never had a ""blow my mind"" meal here either. I met my dad last night for dinner and we ended up splitting a  half portion of the thai crunch salad (veggies,cilantro, peanuts, wontons, rice sticks, and thai peanut dressing) and a BBQ chicken pizza with bacon (bbq sauce, chicken, gouda, red onion, and cilantro). The pizza was a 6 cut and was perfect for splitting. The crust was more, shall we say ""crisp"", than I would have liked but the flavors were all there, perhaps a little too much cilantro though. The bacon, per my dad's request, was ok-did not particularly add to the pizza much and I would have been fine without it actually. The salad was a nice size for splitting since we were going to share the pizza already. I really liked the peanut dressing. Our bill came to $30 and was very reasonable.

aBuFiFd2IYdVsaTi5N3jOw,-RhRXVW9z9fs5zzxhFfnHg,0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw,3,3,2,1,"So I'm apparently oblivious to the fact that anything with the name Joe is owned by the same person.  Luckily for me, I wasn't stupid enough to order bbq pork again.  Joe's Farm Grill is a pretty cool concept and probably the only decent place to eat on this side of the 202 (since Mobsters INC closed, at least).  There are enough review here that clearly he is doing something right.  Suburbanites love to feel like they don't live in a city and, I'm sure, love the idea of a restaurant with picnic tables and trees.  They must because the place was a freaking day care when we went, with snotty brats running all around and climbing on everything.

Anyways, back to the food.  I ordered a BBQ Bacon Burger.  I didn't bother to specify how I wanted it cooked and it was, surprisingly, cooked to a decent medium-well.  I subbed some sweet potato fries with it and they were pretty good.  Little more pepper would have made them great but oh well.  The wife had wanted to sub the veggie fries with hers but they made us order a side of them.  That side was literally 3 pounds of fried veggies and was way too much for any human to consume.  They weren't really my thing but the wife enjoyed.

This place does a lot of things well but they suffer from a lot of the logistical problems that Joe's BBQ does.  The line is better and it keeps people from getting backed up but they seem to run out of menus quickly.  People grab them, carry them in line, and leave them at the window.  As a result, there are no menus left when people walk in.  I refilled the thing twice while I was standing in line.  Also, the condiment/drink counter is outside and all in a row right by the door into the restaurant.  These weird clusters of people trying to get a drink or some sauce develop and creates an obstacle course for people going in and out of the restaurant.  This leads me to my final problem - the indoor pickup window.  While the summer is long and hot (and I'm sure leads to a lot of people usually sitting inside), the day we went had tons of people sitting outside.  When their buzzers went off, they had to go inside to pickup the food.  The single door seemed to be all sorts of hazardous for people going in to get food and people coming out with food.  Finally, and I know this sounds stupid, but the trash can outside has the smallest opening ever.  You cannot actually stick your plastic basket inside the trash can and turn it over to dump your food out.  You have to pick the stuff up out of the basket and throw it away with your hands.  I just finished my meal, cleaned my hands, and now I have to wash them again because I had to handle a greasy, sauce-covered piece of paper to throw it away.

I know this sounds nitpicky but it turned what would normally be a 4-star peaceful lunchtime experience into a logistically stressful nightmare for me.  When you make it hard for me to get in and out with my food, it makes me feel like you don't want me there.  I know they are going to read this and I know they are going to dismiss it just like my gripes about Joe's BBQ but do me a favor, when you build your next restaurant, hire someone with a degree in urban planning to help with the layout instead of just cramming things wherever you think they will fit.",2009-10-19 16:36:07

We were served in somewhat of a tag-team style, there were probably 3-4 different people waiting on us.  I thought that was a bit unusual.  The staff was friendly if a bit aloof.  We did have a spill at our table (yes it was me again, but no drinking was involved this time) which they could have handled better.

We had Pad Thai and an appetizer sampler-I forget what that was called.  The Pad Thai was heavily flavored and the sauce was kind of heavy.  I prefer a lighter sauce for the Pad Thai-it should not be a heavy dish like Alfredo.  The apps were good, particularly the Satay.  The Spring Rolls were overly oily.

I consider the prices here to be a bit high for Thai food as I've had so much great Thai food for very reasonable prices.  If I'm paying 12 bucks for a noodle dish it had better be excellent, not just good.",2008-05-01 19:40:45

Compared to other izakayas in town, Cocokala's offerings are higher in price, but not necessarily higher in quality.

My favorites were the chawanmushi, miso cod, and I believe the braised pork belly bowl.  The chawanmushi was light on the seafood, but it was a good version of the dish.  The miso cod was flavorful, but a very small portion.  The braised pork belly was served in a rich broth, and was tender enough to easily pull apart with chopsticks.  

One disappointment was the bakudan dish, which had natto as one of the main ingredients.  Instead of the expected intense smell and flavor of the soybeans, it turned out to be a very bland dish.  I only managed to eat it with hot mustard added.  Our table also ordered several skewers, all of which were average and a bit pricey.

I really love this restaurant; the house is very impressive and rich in history, and the interior decor is grand and stunning to say the least. One of the best French decor in the city. 

Awesome experience here. The waiter was professional and the service was top notch!  

My wife ordered Caesar Salad and I ordered Escargot for starters. They make the Caesars in front of you which was a cool experience. My wife said the Caesar was creamy and a hint of vinegar just like how she wants it. My escargot was tender and was bathed in butter and garlic; super tender and delicious!  They also flambé the escargot in front you. What an experience!!!

For the mains, my wife ordered the Duckling a l'Orange Grand Marnier and I went with Peppercorn Steak - medium rare. The duck came first and it looks absolutely delicious. My wife said the duck was crispy, deboned and the orange sauce really complimented the duck; well balanced, not too too sweet. Finally our waiter pulled the flambé station over and cooked the peppercorn sauce. When it was ready, he poured it on top of the steak and hand it over. I cut the steak and it felt like I was cutting butter. Medium rare to perfection!  They got it right!  

We end the night sharing the tiramisu. Oh my god, the tiramisu was heavenly, possibly the best that I've had anywhere. Yelpers, this is a definite must try!

It wasn't very busy when I went there on my own, and had a subdued and relatively quiet atmosphere compared to the other two spots which were incredibly busy and had an urgency to them. Maybe I was there between rushes though.
In fact Kenzo felt more like a nice family diner even though it had all the right ingredients to be a contender in the ramen wars we are all a part of.
Maybe the frenzied atmosphere is what helps make the ramen taste so good. For example, reading the tips and tricks section at Isshin they mention that you should finish your bowl of ramen in 8 minutes for maximum enjoyment of the ingredients. Take any longer and it goes downhill from there. 
I had the cold sake for a side to the soup, but I didn't notice a beer swilling haze happening while I was there which seems to be a part of the ritual of enjoying a hot bowl of salty sublime broth and crispy pieces of tender chicken or nibbling edamame.

With finishing up my Goyemon stamp card, I now feel like I have the freedom to eat whatever sushi spot I please without having the feeling of ""oh that could have been another stamp to fill before my card expiration date"" feeling. 

With that said, I think Sakana should take up punch cards! I mean don't get me wrong, Goyemon is great, but it's the power of the punch card and the idea that I could get a free meal soon that kept me tied to the place for so long. Oh and the fact that they basically set a deadline to receive your free meal.

I really enjoyed my 2nd visit to Sakana. I definitely saw lots of improvements in the menu, although they were minor, they still made a big impact. For example, the subtle garnishes they add on different nigiri. My absolute favorite is the super white tuna topped with sea salt and shredded nori. I couldn't believe the huge taste difference with such a small added detail. Also, the small pieces of ikura added on to salmon belly nigiri were on point! I received complimentary hamachi sashimi pieces from the chef. I was absolutely grateful for it, but the pieces were still a bit frozen and hard to chew through. That was sort of disappointing. However everything else definitely made up for it. 

They now provide a menu sheet that you can mark on, which is great! I go a little crazy at sushi restaurants and it's hard to remember exactly what I want for the first order -- there's lots of fish names swimming around in my head. It really helps me and the server that I can just mark down what I want per order. 

There were lots of presentation improvements too. I like that they added a leaf garnish (?) between the plate and your order. It makes for a great food photo op :) However, I feel like they still need to work on the interior design of the restaurant. They had scrolls of cloth sectioning off the tables that had messaging scribbled on with what looked like a crayon. It just doesn't represent the quality of their food well. I noticed behind the sushi chefs they had vertical rectangular sheets of paper hanging all over the walls that I would assume represents Japanese custom of a menu (like Ichiza). If they could set the ambiance and decor as a traditional chic sushi restaurant, this place would be perfection. Like if Kabuto and Ichiza had a restaurant baby, I would hope it would be what Sakana looked like. 

But the important thing really is the food selection. Still a big fan of their large cut nigiri pieces! This place will definitely be my go-to spot for my next few sushi fixes.",2013-10-24 18:39:40

You cannot beat the prices, $3-$5 for a fresh sandwich and the best French Baguettes or croissants if you prefer! Although there sodas are small and expensive, around $1.75 especially compared to $1 for a large at other places.

We were very confused and lost at first because we parked in the parking lot of off Providence Rd and could not find a RuRus door with a sign. Walk around people, learn from our mistakes lol.

When we finally found the front door (back door????) we were immediately seated and we started with drinks off the bat! I ordered the Frank the Tank with raspberry and my friend ordered the Say Hello to my Little Friend. WARNING: Frank the Tank is no joke, I asked for more raspberry and still could barely drink it lol if I was going out for the night I would appreciate that drink being so strong! BUT I was going shopping afterwards and I knew it would be a struggle to shop after that drink. Over all the drink is worth the money lol

For appetizers we ordered the Billy Ray Valentine. The queso was really good but a little too runny for my liking.

qNSF2ht8aHIoZsMRUaeVtg,Q6Dcxo3_lNCzkqK7J3FL7A,xmAakatNKpvIJ-Fmq5swCw,4,5,0,1,"What a charming place to grab a meal!  I came here on a Friday night with my friends.  I fully expected a wait, from reading other reviews, but to my delight there was none.

We started off with the bread and butter board ($4).  It came with a few slices of bread, including a pretzel bread, a jalapeno cheese bread, and another kind.  The breads were all great and tasted freshly baked.  The butter it came with was delicious!  If only it had been a bit softer, it would have spread so nicely on the bread.

Two of my friends shared the cheese and vegetable boards for their meals.  The veggie board came with a wide variety of veggies, with bread and chips to eat them with.  It was also served with two little cups of dressing.  The cheese board had some different cheese, also with bread and chips, and on the sides little cups of dried fruit and some type of seeds (sunflower maybe?).  They seemed to enjoy them!  Although I heard the blue cheese was a bit strong.

For my entree I got the roasted chicken.  After my first bite, I knew I loved it.  The chicken was served at a great temperature - very warm!  It was so juicy - the juiciest piece of white meat I've ever had.  My only dislike was that they sprinkled some peppercorns on top and those were REALLY strong peppercorns.  I had to pick them off bc I didn't like the taste.  Also, they included a sauce on top of the dish that was a bit too salty.  Towards the end of eating the salt became a little overwhelming.  I liked the dish a lot, but if I came again I'd probably try something else bc they had lots of interesting stuff on the menu!

tip: it's kind of hard to find, located in the back corner of a little strip mall center type place. another tip is that they sell bundles of local veggies here for $25.  so you can come every Friday and pick up a box of local veggies if you want.

another tip: they serve brunch until 5 pm on the weekends, awesome for late risers (like me)!",2014-10-11 22:41:48

I took the family to dinner a couple nights ago and used their new Mobil app to order.  The claim to fame for the app is to ""pass the line"".  

So I get there and walk to the pick up area. I then stand there waiting while the cashiers take the orders of the people who are in line and tell me they will be with me momentarily.  So I wait. One they clear out the line of the customers who were in line, they greet me. I tell them I'm there to pick up. 

I wait...and I wait. 

As I stand there waiting I am watching food go out the side door to the customers who had walked in at the same time and after me. 

Once those customers begin eating. Shortly after another mobile app customer comes in and gets her order quickly. She leave the restaurant and come right back in minutes later explaining her order was wrong. The employee collects the food they had given her and says, ""oh it this customers food"".  She then takes the kids meals from the lady and hands them to me. I tell the employee I don't want that food as it had left the restaurant and then came back. She rolled her eyes and scratched her two toned skunk hair. After trying to reason with her that I didn't want to give the food to my kids, she throws the bags in the trash and gets another employee working on the order, while she begins messing around on Facebook swiping through photos and showing anther employee at that manager station. 

I finally get my order after 35 minutes of waiting and the customers who had came in behind me are walking out with full stomachs.

The 'next level' mentioned is regarding pricing as we paid $37 and change for 2 burgers, one of them a combo and 2 sodas total. Thirty Seven Dollars. For that amount Ill be grocery shopping for a 3 day haul. I get it it's organic, most of everything they serve comes from the farm within a stone's throw of the restaurant and the meat is local. I am always confused as to why when that is the case, things are so much more expensive. I think restaurants are starting to realize in Gilbert that although people are flocking here to save money, that they have money to burn as a result and so raising the prices of what you would normally pay for up to maybe 20% above what the actual value...25% above actual value maybe, are what people are going to pay and they are. Now there are very long lines here depending on when you go and they've quite the nostalgic feel in the bathroom too.

FqSCC_zU8Su1PN7jFCcsBg,cyuDrrG5eEK-TZI867MUPA,N6-dAWPTAaHqwRb94vXFCQ,5,3,1,2,"Well, we now have logged six visits here, three lunches and three dinners and they have done extremely well and now deserve a rare five-star rating.  Here is why:

Family run and local in attitude.  They are not trying to be fru-fru or get a Zagat rating.  They just want to well-serve good solid Italian food to patrons.  The decor is truly home-made and quaintly Italian.  The focus is on food and service.

No reservations so be prepared to wait, but turnover is reasonable and the wait worth it.

The lunch menu is less in options and in prices than the dinner menu, but you can order off of the dinner menu if you pay an additional amount during lunch.  Bear in mind that it does depend on the kitchen having what you want ready to put together.  Dinner menu has parms and, our favorite, bolognese sauce.

A lot of Italian eateries have bolognese sauce, but few do it well.  Diced beef (sometimes with a little pork) marinated in milk and then slowly simmered with a little onion, carrot & celery makes for a rich (is it ever!) thick sauce put over pasta or in lasagna.  You will not be able to eat all of your portion because it is so flavorful and richly delicious.  The bonus is that you leave with a lunch portion for the next day.

We order the penne bolognese, with the cooperation of the kitchen at lunch and for a $2 extra charge.  A good item to try if this is your first time out.  The parms are veal, chicken and eggplant and are authentically prepared and served with pasta.  Lotsa food to enjoy.

They have a house Italian salad dressing that is simply red wine vinegar that is excellent.  Put that on your side salad.

One downside is that the wine is jug wine.  No need for a wine list, just go red or white.  The food is good enough with or without wine, so accept that this is local flavor in a nice way.

I hate to tell everyone about Rizzo's because it is already a hot destination and now people from the big city will be driving down across the border to enjoy this.  Suggest you come early to minimize wait time.

Excellent TV's and a NEW server that was backed up by a seasoned pro, making sure we had everything we wanted. As expected the ownership team was present and welcoming, that was my favorite part.

We shared some wings and a pizza and both were great. The Pizza crust is 2 large flour tortillas melded together with some melted cheese then over topped with great sauce, above average mozzarella and lots' of meat, it was almost executed perfect but still real good. the wings are large with a great classic Buffalo sauce. both ranch and bleu cheese served as requested. Awesome crisp celery and carrots served along side and that was FRESH! These wings are about a million times better then BWW and a far better deal.

The decor is beautiful and there was tapestry all over the walls! Not entirely pleased about where our table was located though, it seemed to be in the middle of everything (just on the end of the stairs, in front of the drinks booth, etc.)

Our server was incredibly helpful with portion sizes and recommended a bunch of appetizers to split, and a paella, followed by individual desserts at the end.  Great suggestions on his part, as the portions were perfect in the end.  

Appetizers included Pan Con Tomate, Almendras Saladas, Dátiles Con Tocino Ibérico, Queso De Cabra Frito Con Higo Y Miel, and an octopus one that was a special of the day. All of these were pretty good, the pieces we each got were tiny, but we ordered a bunch of apps, so in the end, it worked out fairly well. None of them stood out significantly to me, they were just all fairly good.

The paella we ordered was a daily special with chicken in it. Definitely not a dish to be had individually or even shared with 2 people.  We split the paella among 5 of us, and we all could have seconds too.  

A word of caution to vegetarians, this place isn't too friendly for you folks, the one vegetarian at our table did have a salad instead of the paella, but keep in mind a large portion of the menu does have meats in it.

Dessert-wise, I ordered the Flores Con Miel Y Helado De Turrón which is a ""Spanish Pastry + Orange Blossom Honey + Turrón Almond Ice Cream"".  Presentation was beautiful and the ice cream was filled with an almond flavour.  The pastry itself was crispy and not flaky, just perfect.

In terms of price, you definitely do get what you pay for, the quality of the service and food was amazing, so, as expected, the price is elevated similarly.  I do believe the bill was around $200 at the end, which is more or less expected for a group dinner of this calibre.",2014-12-18 21:01:55

This one you can expect on occasion to get your main meal first then your appetizer or both togeather. The meals don't come out all at once but are on a when ready schedule.

 My order:
Jelly fish + cucumber - mediocre, but large portion, jelly fish is very crunchy (Isn't it suppose to be blanched in hot water, then marinated and not completely raw? I'm more use to eating the traditional style i.e. cooked, seasoned, elastic texture.)
King mushroom + veggies - good
Spicy beef tendon - good, never seen this before
Spicy eggplant - good, no meat (love it)
Sweet & sour fish - good, fish pieces could be larger
Plain rice - standard, fresh

I actually liked this place. I didn't dine in but it was pretty roomy with lots of seating. Food was good, not too salty, not loaded with MSG, not too spicy, just flavoured for your average palate, and large portions. Service was prompt, courteous, and efficient. Price was fair value.

It's peaceful and soothing, yet makes you really think when you come across an amazing painting (which is quite often in this museum). 

Cleveland Museum also does its fair share of promoting great events during the week nights and weekends. One of my favorites are the monthly mix events where they focus on a certain genre of music or a certain type of style they want newcomers to be prepared to upon arriving.

The banchan (free refill) that came before the meal was also delicious, well seasoned bean sprouts, kim chee and radish. The owner/server was very nice to us and even gave my wife an extra cup of their specialty Korean tea to go.  We also had some fresh peanuts that just finished boiling in Hawaiian sea salt.

It looks so nice and stylish.  The brunch menu has a lot to choose from.  I didn't quite know what I wanted to eat so I had The Standard.  The Standard is eggs (your choice of cooking preparation), bacon or sausage, roasted potatoes, and toast.  Everything was very good.  The bacon had a very nice flavor and my poached eggs were perfect for me.  Someone at the table also had poached eggs.  Her eggs were really hard boiled, so I wonder if different people cooked them or if the chef is inconsistent.

The drink menu looks very fun.  One brunch member got the Bloody Mary that looked impressive (size wise).  It was interesting that it was served with a spear of cucumber instead of a dill pickle.  I ended up getting a Amaretto Stone Sour on the rocks.  It was the sweet I was looking for to accompany my eggs and toast.  I liked it.

I walked through the bar to get to the bathroom and there is a lot of space there and it is equally as pretty as the dining room.

I definitely like that they seem to make regular updates and additions to the mall, which there's always something changing here. For instance, I hadn't come here in three weeks and within that period, the smoothie place was gone and replaced with an eyeglass kiosk. That was sad, though, as it was the only place that offered bubble tea in the south hills that I know of. Hopefully they're bringing that back!

The food options are okay. They're pretty decent and somewhat varied as far as mall food goes. They recently renovated the food court and it's now much easier to walk through and it also appears much brighter. I think the last time I was here, all their food court vacancies have been filled. 

I like that they put in a Target that connects to the mall. However, a complaint is how Barnes and Noble does not connect. If you're a newbie to the mall, you probably wouldn't know that.

uBGn02x5nZcBzKXBdQZ7GA,EyYVD9n7PlYYLTSEQ5t14w,HxSINQAplSFAn6of-wexcA,4,1,0,0,"I LOVE Thai food. So when heading to a nearby Indian restaurant and I saw this place, plans changed and we ate here instead. The restaurant is tucked into the back of a small plaza but surprisingly seats quite a few patrons. The ambiance is simple but effective, with photographs of various Buddhist and Thai-inspired images. 

My hubby & I perused the extensive menu which had helpful pictures and star ratings for their most popular dishes. There are quite a few choices of appetizers like satay skewers and green mango or papaya or shrimp salads although we opted to forego the apps in order to try more main dishes. We ordered the pork Penang, a beautifully peanutty, slightly spicy curry dish served with green beans. I really enjoy the Penang curry at Thai Basil in Richmond Hill but this version at Nimman is an equally (if not more) delicious version IMO by nature of the sauce being less thick and having that refreshing kick that keeps you coming back for more. 

We also ordered the chicken with long song sauce, and crispy cashew chicken. Of the dishes we ordered, the long song chicken was just ok but was served over rice and came with a bit of Thai shrimp paste, which added a slight saltiness and slight tanginess that elevated the dish. 
My husband has long been trying to find a Toronto Thai restaurant that can replicate his favourite cashew chicken (""H6"") from a popular Houston Thai place called Kanomwan. Most restaurants have fallen short of his memory of his beloved Kanomwan cashew chicken. The crispy cashew chicken at Nimman is prepared with thinly battered chicken pieces, some bell peppers, onions, thinly sliced carrots, orange slices, and of course, cashews. Although Nimman's version was not quite the thick barely-there sauce that my hubby recalls, it was very very tasty. The crispy chicken pieces add a lovely texture contrast. We are excited to come back here to try it again with a custom order for the chef to make the sauce a bit thicker. 

I'm not sure about other patrons who have had challenges with the service, but we found the wait staff to be very attentive and helpful, especially as far as discussing and suggesting how to custom order the crispy cashew chicken to make it closer to the way my hubby wants it.

Food pricing is reasonable. 3 main dishes and an extra bowl of rice came to ~$43. Although Mimico is a good 40 minute drive from where we live, we will definitely come back.

We initially went to Pam Real Thai just a mile over based on the review.  Looked really interesting, but alas, it was closed because they were only open for dinner.  So we looked up this place on Yelp and decided to head over.  First impression good, there were a couple of party waiting outside for a table for this small joint.  About 100 degrees outside so not too pleasant, but looking forward to the food.  We put our name in for 2, but there was a party of 9 in front that they said would need to be seated first.  No problem.  We wait about 10 minutes, and the big party goes in to get seated.  In the meantime there were a couple other small parties that came around, but we didn't pay attention too much.  Another big party of 8 comes, puts their name in, and waits.  10 minutes or so later, the party of 8 goes in!  I go inside to check out what's going on, and the small parties that came after us are also seated already!  So I go over to the counter and ask them when we were going to get seated, they look at the ""wait list"" and our name is still on it, with people below us crossed out!  What the heck?  They realize, say ""oh"", and says, ""sit over there"" and points to the empty table.  No apologies, just a point of a finger.  Man, food must be really good here to tolerate this, I thought.  We later witness that there is another party getting a similar treatment so notching this one as an inefficient system that has got to get fixed.

Service does not improve as the meal goes on, however.  We flag the server down to order our drinks and food, never got served water, and they never checked up on us for the meal.  Onto the meal.  We ordered a Thai Iced Tea, Thai Iced Coffee (no difference as Vietnamese one), Yellow Curry, and Spicy Fried Rice.  In general, everything was good.  But both the curry and rice was too salty.  The dishes were plain, no garnishments, and smaller in size to justify the cheaper price.  So not necessarily a bargain.  Tea was good, no complaints, coffee was typical.  So overall 3-stars for the meal.  If it wasn't so salty, the curry would have been great.

So throughout the meal, the servers never approached us, we called them EVERY TIME.  To order, to ask for anything, to ask for the check.  That gets a zero in my book and I let the tip speak for that.  I pay for the food, I tip for the service.  Servers should always remember that, I don't care what you get paid.

Table-for-1 Factor:  They had lone diners, so it is fine.  Whether they can accommodate you...",2014-05-27 16:18:36

My gf and I were one of the first to arrive and he made sure to get us some tasty beverages to sip on. We both had 2 mojitos ($9/piece)! They were soooo refreshing with a good amount of mint!

We had an order of salsa and chips prior to our meal. The salsa was also very refreshing. A lot of the girls commented on not expecting it to be as fruity as it was but enjoyed it. The fruit was bonus in my book :)

I ordered the fish tacos ($18). They were fried and I wish there had been a grilled option but they were still pretty damn delicious. There were three on the plate with a HEAPING portion of cilantro (triple bonus points for this). I only ate 2!

For anyone who's curious, suya is like the West African version of a kebab, that's grilled with West African spices and generally pretty damn spicy. The menu consists of gourmet wraps and meals that come with a side such as rice, jollof rice, veggies, or potatoes.

I ordered up the Suya Steak and Chicken with Jollof rice (West African jambalaya). The steak was sliced nicely and is pretty nice quality. The meat was tender, but the spices were a bit much. The chicken was even better. It was like a quarter chicken with the white meat, but this was the most tender chicken breast I've had in quite some time. The meat was so easy to cut through and I was using a plastic fork!? The chicken tastes great too as the skin wasn't overbearing with spice and worked well with the onions and peppers. The jollof rice was way too spicy for me and so I only plowed through about half of it before calling it quits.

The place is primarily takeout but there is a lunch counter and a pair of small tables in case you need a place to sit and enjoy.

The first time we came, I had ordered the kung pao chicken lunch special and my friend ordered the cashew chicken lunch special. I honestly didn't really like the kung pao chicken because it wasn't spicy at all. However, the cashew chicken dish was great! The second time we came in, I ordered the chicken chow mein lunch special and my buddy ordered the same cashew chicken dish. This time, the chow mein was great and was really flavorful! So after the second time, I was able to respect this place a bit more.

Service wasn't that bad. The waitress came by frequently to check on us despite the growing number of people starting to show up for lunch. 

I honestly think the food is great for the price and they don't try to rip you off with the portion size. I left stuffed both times! Also this place is close to many clinics, UMC and Valley Hospital, so it makes it really easy to grab a quick lunch.

In come cases this means unusual ingredients like pork kidney, or just copious amounts of peppers as with the seczuan dishes. 

Being veg it took a bit of time to tease out dishes that were meat free and still had flavor but we managed a decent array, however I really want to go back and try some of the more exotic dishes and see if they can be made meat free.

It was quite busy for a Monday night, and only two staff members were on at the time,  but they handled it well with smiles on their face, and were the epitome of patience.

I enjoyed all three flavors of macaroons that we got - the vanilla being my favorite, oddly enough (I usually find vanilla plain), with the somewhat tart raspberry and very nutty pistachio coming in a close second and third, respectively. 

I also enjoyed the stracciatella gelato very much, but I LOVED the amarena. I haven't had amarena since I was a teenager, living in Italy. It was everything I remembered and loved about it. Creamy, with the ribbon swirl of cherry purée and the whole amarena cherries went perfectly with the cram and chocolate shavings of the stracciatella. 

Side note, my partner asked for two cups of water when we got out gelato (at the end of the experience), and the lady at the counter didn't even miss a beat, got the water with a smile, and politely moved into the next guest. Stellar customer service.

I tried them for the first time at their truck at the Fabulous Food Festival a few months ago.  I was excited to end up here for lunch with friends last weekend.

You can get create-your-own tacos or choose from their specialty menu. I did one of each, and while designing my own was fun, I didn't do the best job. The shrimp was great, and the barrio secret sauce and queso fresco were too, but the cabbage topping kind of overwhelmed the whole thing.  Also, next time I'm making more adventurous tortilla decisions, because my friend's green goddess with queso and guacamole looked excellent.  I also had the huevos rancheros taco and loved it, but I think I'd ask for more hot sauce next time.  Speaking of which, if you're a hot sauce fan don't hesitate to go big and don't be intimidated by their pepper symbols; the sauces all have great flavor but to me the three-pepper secret sauce didn't pack much of a punch.

It's crowded, so plan on waiting a bit, unless you get there before noon. Even though they were slammed, service was great, and we got in and out and back to our conference in around an hour.

Greenhouse Tavern provided me with one of the best dining experiences of my entire life! I can count on one hand the times I've had a truly memorable, delicious, well- rounded, eclectic meal with superb food and drink in a unique environment. (Other places in CLE that fit this description include the W.6th Crop, Dante, and the now-closed Bar Symon (R.I.P., pork cracklins).

Derek and I went here for our third wedding anniversary. A night off from the world of high chairs and smushed banana is a plus to begin with, but add to that a warm, beautifully decorated atmosphere, attentive staff, and mouth-watering food, and you've got me paying attention.

We decided to each get the tasting menu at $44 apiece. Soooo worth it, because we got a three courses as well as a choice of either a half or dessert. Although the Animal frites sounded remarkably heart- attack provoking, and therefore awesome, I decided to go for the dessert.

Here's what we got.

Me: beet salad, goat pasta, Ohio beef burger, Dobos torte.

Him: bacon-wrapped apples, duck pasta, and a WHOLE BEEF SHIN. Yes, it was ridiculous, and I'm including pictures. People were staring and laughing. (Possibly pointing too.) we ate that delectable, tender pot roast for a whole week. Did I mention they included the bone? Six pounds in all. And yes, we took the bone home too. To add insult to injury, he got the buttered popcorn pot du creme for dessert.

Everything was amazing. My only criticism was that the fries that came with my burger were way too salty. But everything else was great.

I love the extensive beer list, the kinda-casual, but still trendy, atmosphere (because there's only a handful of days out of the year when I can pretend to be trendy, and I kinda wanna fit in), and the bottle of water that remained on the table for us to refill our glasses, even though it wasn't really needed, because we got refills from the servers approximately once every eight minutes.but it was a nice thought.

I will fantasize about this meal for months, and when I return, I probably won't be as impressed, because I'm negative and cynical like that. But I'm glad that I have this memory in my mind of Greenhouse, and I'd like for it to stay there for quite some time.",2011-10-29 14:58:42

So if you know the chipotle concept, it's like an assembly line. You walk up to the first person, give your order, and she starts it. Burrito? Meat? Beans? Rice? Then to the next person. Type of salsa? Cheese? Lettuce? Then on to the cashier. It's a simple process. Right? But...what if there's a missing ingredient like lets just say, steak? Does the process stop? As the line starts growing and growing, do you just wait? Employees are just waiting. People are waiting and the line keeps growing. 

What do you do? The cashier starts to clean counters bc we are all waiting! The right thing to do is to try to keep the process going. Examples should be like: The cashier starts ringing people up, having the ones who are waiting for steak move to the side, tell other people who are waiting in line that there is a wait for steak, maybe it will make them change their mind to get a different meat, work on orders that are non steak related. These are great ways to move the process along and create efficiencies! 

The workers were like deer in front of the headlights bc there is no steak and they had no idea what else to do, but to wait and have the line grow longer and longer. The wait for steak was about 5-10 minutes. When we got there, it was about 4 customers. By the time steak was finally available and they were able to continue the assembly line, the line grew triple the size at least 12 customers.

The menu is quite typical for a Greek food restaurant. We ordered two gyros and an order of fries. The gyro tasted very fresh and I feel the meat wasn't overly salty. The fries were fresh cut and were delicious. My only complaint was they didn't give us very much! Oh well, that's better for my waistline anyway.

We went to the Grit and Grace late night Happy Hour for some amazing snacks and drinks and wanted to finish with an amazing meal. I've been dying to get in to Tako. I have seriously been waiting since the day it opened! We walked up at about 10:30 pm and they were able to seat us! 

The ambience in this place is sexy and fun. The red lights and the giant cracken in the wall are so damn cool. Even though the tables were super close I had no trouble focusing on the conversation at the table.  There is an upstairs that looked pretty great. I'd like to try that next time.

We ordered the quacamole with the editions of pepita, bacon, pineapple, and charred poblanos. It was perfection. The chips are thin and crispy and salty perfection.

My friend ordered the Duck Confit taco. Damn. Damn. It was so good. I was hoping he'd offer me more. But I took the liberty of sipping on his drink with out permission so...I won. He had the El Diablo. The drink was so good and fresh with ginger beer and lime that I'm dying too go back for the drinks alone!
I had the Chicken Asado. It was classic with avacodo and crema. My favorites! It was the best chicken taco I've ever had.

This was especially awkward as we didn't know the other party guests we were meeting, because our friend whose birthday it was hadn't arrived yet. 

we ordered our drinks and the waitress seemed nice at first but very cut and dry and seemed only cheerful when talking to us about her sunburn and how she planned to vacation to Honduras. 

from then on the service was down hill, my girlfriend had to wait 15 minutes to get a coffee, and then we had to wait another 15 minutes before we could order food and we had to ask to order food. 

the music was horrible cheesy euro house music that was BLARING and we had to yell to talk to our friends beside us. WHEN WE WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT! haha ridiculous! we asked to have the music turned down, only to have them crank it back up 20 minutes later. 

ordered pasta and it was ""okay"" but obviously made from store bough dry pasta, that you can get at Metro next door. i know this from the giant messy pile of pasta boxes literally stacked to the ceiling next to my head where i sat! 

we read the pizza was ""good"" so we ordered their signature "" waving flag pizza"" only to get entirely plain sauceless dough that had been in the oven and raw toppings put on after wards. no melted cheese almost zero olive oil. no love put into this pizza whatsoever.

the bruschetta my friends ordered was a joke served on the same overly thin sliced tasteless bread that they toss at you for free when you sit down. 


waitress was basically never there to check on us unless we told another server to go get her. 

we had to ask 3 times to be brought sparkling water, no parmesean cheese was offered and there was almost zero pepper coming out. 

was brought our bill with the tip already added at about 13%. i don't think i would have tipped more than 5% had i been given the option.

I didn't know we were even coming here, so I did not adequately prepare myself for the foods. Having a short few days in Vegas meant I was already making the most of it by eating the entire time. Not even 3 hours before I had been stuffing my face already. This ended up being meal number 4 for the day. 

Luckily, this was not an AYCE place. This is more like those Japanese BBQ places with a set menu, but with Korean banchan. They have a large variety of banchan including some dishes I've never seen before. All the items were very good. The meat itself was well seasoned and very tender. Of course, you get smaller but more appropriate portions of meats, which I definitely appreciated. Had this been an ""eat as much as you can to get your money worth"" location, I would not have been able to participate as well. 

Unlike other KBBQ joints, they cook everything for you. Instead of wasting your time trying not to burn your meat or figuring out if it's done or not, someone else does it. You are responsible for just putting it on your plate or directly into your mouth once it's done.

I sit in the middle of the bar and order a warm rum drink, a lobster bisque, and a carpetbagger. I've met a lot of the staff here, so they were fairly casual with me, but I wish they had steered me in a better direction with my orders.

The warm rum cocktail was totally fine with the horrible weather we've been having, but the bisque was pretty moderate. Bisques are heavily seasoned creamy crustacean soups, and while the bisque wasn't as hot or seasoned as I'd have liked (I want my bisque to be heavily salted and seasoned and gluttonous in general), the real offenders were the burnt capers and overdone bits of lobster. Now, I get that Wisconsin folks can be scared of seafood, but they're lobster! Figure out just how much to cook them before throwing them in hot soup and it's amazing.

A hip mixed couple sat down next to me at the bar. The man was a berret wearing Jewish gentlemen that kept company with a Japanese woman wearing legwarmers. We had a really good conversation.

The steak arrived mid conversation. I was kind of stunned with the presentation. Carpetbag steaks are oysters and steaks put together. Tldr carpetbag steaks are opulence for your mouth. What was on the plate was a 12 inch kabob through my 8oz tenderloin on top of a thin brown sauce. It didn't look rich which is a problem especially when it doesn't taste rich. I immediately tried ordering the scalloped potatoes (which I know are amazing), but I was told they were out. Hilariously when my chef buddy showed me the kitchen, there they were. I tried ordering anything *fast* so I could keep my meal going, but neither bartender knew what was quick. I ended up with hash browns.

Jazz starts. Dim yellow lights and shadows bounce around the contours of the giant sea shell at the end of the bar. Of course it's Wisconsin and they end their set with a birthday shout out.

My friends came and we sat and talked. Chef buddy from before is interested in food and we chatted a lot - especially about that carpetbagger. He agreed with me on p much all points. I probably could have complained my way to something else on the menu, but that wasn't really my goal. My other friend came and she ordered an Awniker and a smoke stack. Along with the Oyster Burger, those two are my go tos.

What's really funny is that while this review sounds pretty negative, I still like the place. It's really easy to discredit the ambiance, and conversation, and music. It's really easy to focus on my bad experience even though that Oyster Burger is maybe my favorite in Madison. To be honest, this review is just a long writeup about the small things that keep this place from being great.",2013-12-08 18:58:20

We are picky eaters, and the aroma of food hits you in the face when you walk in.  We only like eat freshest garlic and ingredients off the vine.  This delicious soft crust compliments all the ingredients. We ordered a 16"" Boss pizza no tomato. Fresh garlic, mushroom, black olives and Italian sausage.

Next time I think we should get an Italian sausage pizza because it left me craving for more!! This was excellent service but it's not as good as our favorite place.  It's very close to New York style pizza with an old world flavor. I like my NY pizza greasy and dipping from the cheese.  I would say I'm not sure if I should give it 4.5 stars or more.

Casbah is a great local place that serves smaller (but admittedly pricey) portions, and they change their menu up frequently to match the ingredients available to them each season.

The set-up is...different? I couldn't quite figure out what was going on with it; you basically walk into a door and enter what looks like what was once a courtyard, which was covered with a canvas - maybe they take this down during the summer? Possibly? I'm not sure; anyway, if you walk to the back of the courtyard you'll get into the actual bar.

The menu here, at least during my visit, was delicious - fantastic fresh sangria, a very interesting but tasty bruschetta (that, rather than going with the traditional tomatoes and basil, was covered in a kind of cream cheese, greens and nuts), and a reasonably portioned bowl of pasta with sausage and spinach. Not complaints, other than the fact that the pasta was a bit spicy and I wasn't warned about this. It wasn't too strong, though.

Our waitress was doing the best that she could (I think) but was a little slow. Still, the place was fairly busy and I had good company to talk to during my meal, so no hard feelings on that one.

I say give this place a try if you have the money to spare - and even then, get a coupon or a Groupon; I went with someone who was using a birthday gift card, and it helped the pricing tremendously.",2013-04-11 15:27:24

This Library is one of my favorite ones in Vegas.  Why?  Here's the breakdown:

PROS
- It's clean and well kept.

- If they don't have the book you're looking for, they will order it from another library in Vegas so you can pick it up later.

- There are plenty of quiet areas where you can sit, read, study, or relax.

- They enforce the ""no cell phone"" rule.....some libraries in town don't.

- They have an Arts area where they feature local artists' work.

CONS
- The lines to check out books can be slow at times.

We sat in the lounge this time to get more of an intimate feel (I guess the birthday girl was in a festive mood) and it did deliver with getting a bit out of the limelight of the main dining area. We sat right next to the bar area which may have lead to the consumption of alcohol at random.

For starters we were given the fries and yes the duck fat fries. Those for some reason just always have me quacking up a storm. The dipping sauces that accompany it do seem to add a special dose of flavor to it, but I was not a fan of the house made ketchup. It just tasted a bit more tomato like then I prefer.

As the main event I went with the filet mignon and partnered that with the Mac and cheese and spicy pork belly rice. The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and melted away once again with every bite. The highlight for me though is the Mac and cheese. It is well worth 3 hours every time and highly recommended. The noodles were soft and none overcooked which is a rarity. My favorite was the cheese though. It is not overloaded and just the gooeyness in each bite sends your mouth into a tailspin.

We have heard lots of good things about this place and I am pleased to say it is as good as people say. We were seated on the patio (a good option for a rowdy 3 year old) and were promptly given water. I ordered the Tres Amigos margarita special of the night ($7) and liked it. Next time, I'll have to try the rasberry ($8) or pomegranate margarita ($9). Hubby got the mojito and it was decent. They were also doing free tequila tastings of Tres Amigos Blanco, Anejo and I can't remember the third. I really enjoyed that as anytime I am typically having tequila, I am not exactly concerned with the tastings differences in each blend. So, I learned something new this time. Very cool. The menu looks really great and I look forward to trying new dishes here. I had the salmon and spinach enchiladas that came with rice and vegetables. The rice was moist and delicious and reminded me a lot of the rice I grew up eating with Puerto-Rican dishes. The veggies were my favorites: red onions, and green and yellow squash. The enchiladas were pretty good but I would probably not order them again. I am more of a traditional enchilada type of girl and as much as I love salmon, I guess I don't prefer it in my enchiladas. But that is no fault to Padres as the dish was very good. My husband ordered their steak and unfortunately, his medium rare steak came out well done. They fixed it but hubby was very annoyed that I was pretty much finished with my plate when his remake came out.

Pros:
Great tasting pho

Cons:
Portions are smaller than other places

We came here because one of my fav HK style cafes Fortune Stone was going to be a 20+ min wait.  We were in a hurry so we decided to try this place.  

We were greeted by a very nice lady as soon as we walked in and were seated promptly.  This place is a simple no frills type of place that concentrates on the food and service which is completely fine by me.  

We ordered two bowls of pho and a spring roll appetizer.  The food comes out quick and hot.  The noodles they use here are thinner than other places and I think I like them more honestly.  They had great bite and the broth was pretty good too.  The spring rolls weren't as crunchy as other places but the filling was very good and that's where it counts.

The portion size is my only gripe about this place.  The small size is the smallest bowl I've ever seen at a pho restaurant.  I would always at least order the medium unless you know you're a very small eater. Their medium and large sizes are small and mediums at other places relatively.  All in all, it's $1 extra which is a not a crazy big deal.

You can get additional sides if you want like mushrooms, creamed corn, creamed spinach, peas, shrimp cocktail and asparagus.  They also serve ribeye steak and lobster tail.

Recently I came here with a couple of friends to have a meal before a soccer game. I decided to go for the whole Chicken Cobb Salad with avocado and a side of baguette. I love their salads here. There were a lot of avocados in my salad and being an avocado lover...I have to say that I was in heaven! There were chunks of bacon, hard-boiled eggs cut in halves and loads of chicken slices in my salad. The creamy dressing and chunks of blue-cheese in there made it even better! 

The staff there is always friendly  (they never rush you to order when you are stuck at what you want to order cause everything seems sooo yummy!) and I love the fact that you can order and just to chill in a booth and have someone bring your food to you. They have free wifi and a rewards point system. Speaking of rewards point system! I was able to get a free Chai Latte! It was a bit too foamy for my liking but it came in a huge mug and tasted just right!

Chef Chris Santos brought his highly renowned Beauty & Essex restaurant from NYC to Las Vegas and a majority of its menu along with it.  This is not without change, however, and many things that make the former location great have simply gone missing.

The pawn shop in the exterior front greets you upon arrival.  A door past all the purchasable items leads you to the actual restaurant.  The ambiance is fitting to the name; dim, posh, beautiful with frames, lockets, and pendants hanging from the walls.  A walk past the bar led us to the first of three rooms to dine in.  Gone are the strip views present in the former occupant of this space (Comme Ca') and in its place, a wall.

Our meal for the night:

Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings-  A signature of B & E.   My daughter and wife enjoyed this more than I.  

French Onion Soup Dumplings-  Warning. This can and will burn you the moment you take your first bite if you're not careful.   Not sure if it was the onions, a bit of soup, or what else filled the dumpling, but it did a number on my bottom lip.  Cautiously, I enjoyed the rest of these afterwards.

Yellowtail Sashimi-  Eight thinly sliced yellowtail topped with peppers in a soy chili sauce.  Excellent dish.

Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs -  Three delicious, large-sized meatballs topped with sheep's milk ricotta in a truffle sauce.  A must order when dining here in my opinion.

L.E.S. Donuts - Essentially malasadas which came with caramel, chocolate, and raspberry dipping sauces.  The first caramel sauce came out solidified, unable to be dipped so we asked for a replacement.  Not really worth the price.

The service was okay with minor hiccups.  A few times we asked questions about the food which could not be answered quickly.  The ice cream / sorbet flavors of the night could not be listed without our server having to excuse herself from our table to check back with the kitchen.  

Of things to note:  No foie gras on the menu anywhere.  We are in Las Vegas!  While their NYC location at least offered foie for a certain time period, foie should be a given here and it really is one of the defining items of which I'd come back for if it were executed well.

Another MAJOR missing standout experience:  No champagne bar in the bathroom like its sister location in New York.  In fact, no bathroom at all inside the restaurant!  I asked a host to show us the bathroom to wash our hands and he proceeded to guide me outside past the pawn shop to the common areas of the Cosmopolitan.  As soon as I realized this, I told him I'll finish my dinner first and went back to my table.

The pricing of the items were a few dollars higher and I suppose 'justified' being located on the Las Vegas Strip.  With that said, the food was fairly expensive for what you do receive and I'm not sure anything we tried would have us returning a second time.

The service is friendly and attentive. For a truly unique experience, try getting a sit at the sushi bar and order the omakase.

The $80 omakase will get you 13 pieces of premium sushi and a chopped otoro hand roll. The ingredients were fresh and the sushi were expertly prepared. In addition to the 13 pieces of sushi, I ordered two additional pieces that were ""off the menu"" - made with fishes that I have never heard of. I also ordered a small udon and a chirashi bowl to finish. The food was exceptional.

As far as layout, I think it's quite simple. You can kind of break it into four quadrants: As you walk in you're in the makeup and beauty dept, going clockwise you have grocery and convenience consumables, next is OTC medicine, finally the back corner has homegoods and general merchandise.

I came in tonight to get a prescription filled (and if you follow my check ins then sorry I've been complaining about this sinus infection for hours now!) and while it took a litter longer than their estimate, who cares? I'm getting prescriptions filled at 9:30pm, I'll take what I can get.

While I was waiting, I chit-chatted with a manager I've seen nearly everytime I've been in here, Chuck. They have a nice friendly staff from what I can tell.

Parking lot is kind of crazy, but large for a Walgreens. I suggest you back in to a spot so you can just drive off when you're done, so you don't get in an avoidable accident.

Last but not least, the pharmacy tech advised me to get the OTC version of the nasal spray I was prescribed as it was much cheaper and the exact same active ingredient.

Upon coming here, you can notice that it is very similar to an authentic udon bar found in Japan (as said by my boyfriend, who has been to many udon places in Japan). When you come in, you see a display of plastic udon bowls, giving an example of what to expect. It's similar to a buffet line; you grab a tray and tell the chefs what you want. After you grab your udon or rice bowl, you are lead to a line of 8-10 different types of tempura. You grab a plate and get as many or as little tempura pieces as you want. At the very end of the line, you end up at the cash register and pay for your food. 

Now to the food. The food here is AMAZING. The udon was clearly fresh and had a good bite to it. The broth was tasty and not overpowering. The beef pieces were thinly sliced and tender. The tempura were all crispy and the veggies used for them (as I had the pumpkin and sweet potato) were lightly seasoned and delicious. The surprising part of the meal was how delicious their lemonade was! It's sweet but not too sweet while having a slight tartness to it. In addition, it also had a hint of the lemon rind in the drink.

Frankly I found the cocktail listing confusing with some odd numbered nomenclature instead of standard drink names.  

we started out with the kale chips that seem to be popular.  They were just ok.  Kale doesn't exactly make a good chip so it seems like a misnomer.  There wasn't a whole lot of flavor - just a papery texture and salt.  They were worth a try, but I'm more interested in some of their other appetizers next time. 

My date and I both had difficulty narrowing our dinner selections because so many sound so good.  He got the halibut sandwich with fried okra while I got the country vegetable chopped salad.  Both were fantastic.  We both appreciated the use of fresh, local ingredients and the attention paid to flavor without overdoing it.  The halibut sandwich had the perfect balance of cilantro and a spicy sambol mayo to make it not your ordinary fish sandwich.

In fact, the only other spas I've visited lately are in the Norwegian mountains, where my brethren have the brave, you'll-be-seeing-spots-inducing habit of diving into the snow after after a long sauna.

I used to leave Vegas Sundays midday, like most other dehydrated, decimated weekend warriors. One visit to the Wynn spa, and now I'm a convert to recuperating in-country rather than back in the Bay Area. The hot tub, deluge shower, stream room, sauna and lounge are a killer quint-fecta -- 2 rotations around in the span of 2 1/2 hours mid-afternoon will feel just about right. Shower and head straight to the airport.

If you're prone to spa boredom, grab the Sunday Times magazine on the way over to the hot tub -- I had the pleasure of reading Peter Singer's cogent argument for providing and rationing public health care (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/magazine/19healthcare-t.html?pagewanted=all).

Skylight over the hot tub is genius in the summer.

Not over-crowded, but maybe that's the business cycle.

Sorry, no idea about the treatments.

Go with the Encore Spa if you're looking for an underground palace, Wynn Spa for a cozy den a la Narnia. Slightly different amenities.

Can't tell you anything about the food because we never get to try it.  Sat there for 50 minutes without our food had to hunt down our server and then still didn't bring us anything we needed.  I don't know where the reviews come from - never again.  This is a sad sad restaurant that will eventually shut down for sure.  Pass - if you base the salsa on what food is to come then I'm guessing the food stinks.  Always out of something too.  Today was the torta bread - 

I am so disappointed.  We showed up at 11:30am this morning specifically requesting fish tacos because all of the great reviews and the craving for great grilled fish tacos.  We waited for about 30 minutes got seated and then we sat for another 20 minutes until our server Cecilia showed up.  I specifically told her I knew what I wanted (fish tacos) but the family needed ""a couple"" of minutes to order and we would order the guacamole as an app with no cheese.  

Again we waited and waited no chips no app no drinks.  I ordered a ""premium"" Mexican wine to enjoy with my tacos. Waitress comes back, I checked on our app as it still wasn't there and she forgot to put it in!  She Disappers for a bit again, eventually returns with a poor quality guacamole.  Ok, kids ate it so that's fine.  

We ordered all of our meals and waited and waited.  Right when ALL of our family's food  was coming out she comes to the table and says, ""oh, we are out of fish."" HELLO? either the manager or owner came over and I went through the entire scenario and all he had to say was, ""we've been out of fish since they received the order Friday and ran out yesterday.""  

My husband said we aren't eating if you can't eat so we told them never mind give us the check and we will try another time.  The manager or owner said, "" well what do you want to do with the other food."" What really?  I don't care.  No apologies no nothing.  

We were there from 11:30am-1pm and ate NOTHING BUT CHIPS and had to take a $70 bottle of wine with us!  You can afford huge billboards attracting people and a ""good story,"" but can't accommodate or at least inform your guests not hold up to the reviews.  Awful service awful management and quite frankly the food (guacamole) I would eat my 11 year olds before I would this place!  Pass!  We walked out with  an $88 bill and had to go to eat at a reliable Mexican food place (presidio) as we know there is consistency and care about those customers.

BTW - I should have known that when our waitress was carrying around dirty utensils in her back pocket - and I had to tell her before she removed it - that may be a sign to just leave.

Actually, the fact that Pita Pit and Subway both exist at the same time kind of confuses and angers me. 

Pita Pit gives you WAY more options & variety, and their ingredients are so much fresher. You can add avocado, hummus, tzaziki for no extra cost. 
They freshly prepare their meats on a grill right in front of you.
They have a vegan section of the menu, and I always order the black bean pita which I always stuff full of ingredients until it's really huge. I've taken plenty of non-vegetarians here and they love it. Every time.

Hon-qhZSJYufeZYgBSUEJQ,xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,336_K7i9-jrEhvQleGUVQw,4,3,0,0,"According to my friend O, Grumans Catering and Delicatessen used to be pretty sketchy looking from the outside until recently (they did some renos due to a fire). Heck, I hadn't even heard of it's existence until she suggested we check it out for a late Saturday lunch. Living in Montreal taught me a few things. If you want smoked meat, you go to Schwartz's Deli. How would Grumans compared in relation to the holy Jewish institution? Read on friend, read on.

Having just ate an early brunch at Cerezo, I wasn't exactly starving. But I'll never say no to trying a new place out so I went to meet up with a different group of friends that were also in town for Stampede. At least I was smart and shared two dishes with my friend. Then again, we always share. It's the thought bro! Parking is free on the weekends in their parking lot but you have to street park on weekdays so be aware of that!

The place is very bright with crisp white and blue lines surrounding the walls. They have a lot of food/funny quotes up on the walls which I thought was pretty clever along with a smorgasbord of Bubby's family pictures. The menu has everything you'd expect of a Jewish deli (smoked meat, reuben and matzho soup) but also has a few intriguing twists (smoked meat poutine, eggs benny and challah French toast). A little something for everyone.

- Grumans reuben ($14.00) - smoked meat, sauerkraut, swiss cheese, Russian dressing on grilled rye bread. I haven't had a ruben for ages but this one was off the charts. The sandwich was huuuuge! Super tender, juicy smoked meat with the right amount of fat on each slice. ON POINT brah. If you're craving a sandwich, go with this one. O wanted it all to herself, so greedy. 
- Challah French toast ($12.00) - vanilla, cinnamon, sautéed bananas, nuts and a fruit salad. To combat all the smoked meat we were indulging in, we also shared the challah French toast. Best decision ever. Challah bread is the best. Brings me back to my youth where my one buddy's mom would make it fresh out of the oven whenever I went to their place for dinner Friday nights. This one is for all the brunchies out there. The French toast was delicious - airy, fluffy and delicate. Another solid dish.
- Grumans grilled special ($13.00) - All beef salami, smoked meat, mustard on grilled rye bread. Two buddies ordered the same thing (losers). One tidbit was that when our reuben came out, one bud said he wished he'd ordered ours instead. #winning.

Two other friends came late and ordered the matzho soup and smoked meat poutine. The poutine looked potent (in a good way). Forgot to mention our other buddy ordered the sundried tomato turkey breast but he ate it so fast, I couldn't even get a picture. I don't think you can really go wrong with ordering anything off Grumans menu. Look out for their daily specials (Tuesday - meat loaf, Wednesday - croquet, Thursday - reuben pizza, Friday - beef brisket).

They definitely give Schwartz's a run for their money.",2015-07-29 15:09:16

We were pleasantly surprised with the very good beer selection on tap, meaning they don't just have your typical Bud, Bud Light, Miller, etc. They have a lot to choose from and very good prices on beers to go along with. Since moving in, we have gone to LB about 2 nights a week and have always had a good experience. 

During one of our visits we were informed that they have NFL Sunday Ticket and breakfast, so we were excited to check it out. Now,every Sunday for the past 4 years, we, along with anywhere between 5-10 friends have watched football at the Tavern on Mill. We went to LB for the opening night of NFL on Wednesday and had a great time and we were really looking forward to Sunday. Our reason for wanting access to all the games is that we all play in high dollar Fantasy Football leagues and what better place to pay attention to all the games than a bar? Moving on to Sunday...

We arrived around 9:20 AM for the 10:00 AM games and were pleased with an already good crowd. We got a table in the section we wanted (section with most TV's) and took a look at the signs that said which games would be played on which TV's. Everything was perfect. Then, as the crowd rolled in (majority being Browns fans), everything changed. Every other TV was switched to the Browns game. There were 6 TV's in our section, 2 of which were showing the Browns, 2 of which were showing the Bears/Colts, and then the other 2 were showing different games. We brought this to the owner's attention and he had no interest in hearing us out. In the morning games alone, there were 3 separate games that were not on the TV anywhere in the bar. When we asked if there was any way we could this changed, the owner said ""There are only 20 TV's, there is only so much I can do."" Well, the Browns were on 7 of those TV's! On 3 separate occasions, people from our table, and the table next to us asked for specific games to be shown and were denied every time. WHY HAVE NFL SUNDAY TICKET IF YOU DON'T SHOW ALL THE GAMES?!?!?! We could have stayed home and seen as many games on our home TV's! Also, the beer of the month was Lagunita's IPA..perfect! Except, they were out of their Beer of the Month and it was September 9th. Bad planning..especially when every server's shirt is advertising Lagunita's! 

Our server was awesome, which is the only reason we stayed. There were 10 of us at the table and the owner couldn't give two shits about pleasing anyone other than the Browns fans. Oh, and the table of 6 next to us left because they couldn't get the game they wanted, which was advertised as being played on the TV they were sitting near.

Here is a tip..Get the Browns game going in the Northeast section of the bar where there are two big screens..put on the sound for them, and pile them all in! I understand, you need to make money and the Browns fans had a great following, but you can't sacrifice every other TV in the bar at the expense of every other customer. We are going to try it one more time on Sunday and if all they're doing is playing the Browns on every other TV, then we will be going back to the Tavern. It's too bad, because it is walking distance from us and a local bar we really liked, but if the big guy in the yellow shirt understood the point of having Sunday Ticket, it would have been a much better experience. It really turned us off and we will not go back during the week or on Sundays if they cater to one group. Remember, they will only be there 16 days a year..the Browns aren't making the playoffs. We have been there twice a week since June.

Food is good, prices are good, beer is good, service is good...EVERYTHING was good except all the games being on the TV'S. Spread them out and put them on!! The VIP pass they give for coming every week is also very cool and actually one of the better give away's for Sundays around here.",2012-09-12 04:46:40

The good: We made a reservation so wait time wasn't bad at all. We sat outside and the view was as amazing as people have commented. There was a band playing outside so the intimacy was pretty much gone at that point but they were pretty good and made the ambience less ""stuffy"". The drinks weren't bad at all. If you're concerned about prices, don't get a cocktail and do a beer instead. Cocktails average around $13 but it was good nonetheless. We got a free dessert, the Apple crisp. The boyfriend loved it, I wasn't a fan but to no fault of the dessert. The best part of the meal was the appetizer. We got the Cajun scrimp and baguette and it was delicious- they should make this into an entree. 

The bad: The entrees were just bad. The boyfriend got the New York strip steak with fries and asparagus and I ordered the ribeye with asparagus and herb potatoes. We also got the macaroni and cheese side dish. Both of our steaks were over cooked. I ordered my steak medium and the boyfriend requested medium to medium well. Worst steak I've ever had in my life. It was dry, too charred, and we didn't see any pink until the middle of the steaks. I've had better steaks off my George Foreman grill. I didn't finish my steak and the boyfriend didn't either and we always clean our plates. I literally had 3 asparagus spears on my plate. 3. I'm not sure why they would list asparagus to come with an entree if it's going to be a garnish. On the other hand, the boyfriend got a normal amount of asparagus. It was just like WTF. The macaroni was bad. It had basically no cheese and was not creamy. It got eaten because we were hungry. Our server was okay, just a little odd to me. He wasn't very accommodating and was very nonchalant. I could tell that he either had plans that night that he was missing out on or just didn't want to be working.  

The ugly: Turn around time is horrendous! We ordered the appetizer and entree at the same time and we were left waiting what felt ages and it wasn't even busy. I was at the point of becoming hangry. We didn't send our steaks back because we didn't feel like waiting another 20 minutes and it was getting too late for heavy foods. The food is most definitely overpriced for the poor quality.

When I picked them up they were clean and fresh; I was dropping off some pants and the same lady asked if I would mind if she hemmed the cuffs up for me so I wouldn't be walking on them.  I said sure and started to step around the counter so they could measure the inseam and what not but she said that was not necessary and she could do it by eye....hmm ""ancient Chinese secret"" I presume; I gave her the green light for one pair of pants and was worried all week.  What I received was a beautifully hemmed pair of paints missing the Vegas street stains that had collected while I dragged them all over town. 

I ended up taking in all my pants for this treatment and have been similarly impressed every time;  I asked them to change a button out of one of my shirts and they explained they didn't carry that type of button but did recommend a few stores in town where I could try to find a replacement. Haven't done that yet but will be soon. 

They also give you fee bottled water if you are a paying customer; I haven't been this happy with a dry cleaners since moving from Omaha.  As long as I live nearby I will be using this Dry Cleaners forever.",2012-09-12 20:38:40

I knew they were full of it because when they went over everything on the car that was fine, they said my windshield whippers and I for a fact know that I've needed to replaced them for the last 2 years (and still haven't).

The menu had two vegetarian options. I have noticed that many of these more upscale places tend to have risotto or pasta as their fallback vegetarian option, and it was certainly the case here. I ordered the pasta and it was $20 and one of the tiniest portions I've seen. The problem is, for that price, every bite should have been exciting and new. It should have been heaven. It wasn't.

Bacon is a component of the salad and there was NONE.  This baffles me, a simple Chopped salad and the kitchen forgets ingredients?  It makes me wonder what is really going on in the kitchen.  Is there not anyone checking the food before it leaves the kitchen?

As an owner you should take pride in your place and check on the people helping you make a living.

We started off in the bar while we were waiting for everyone to show up - quiet and completely unobtrusive.  The bartenders were very friendly and managed to keep us in conversation about the international locations - places we've now vowed to get out to.

I ended up ordering the California cut (anything larger would have been tremendous) with creamed spinach, a baked potato, and mashed potatoes.  The waitress actually suggested we could go half/half on our sides to make sure we could try others - certainly not a courtesy that I expected.

We couldn't finish the meal - it was so much food we ended up giving the leftovers to my brother's pitbull (she'll tear the hell out of those bones).  Again, I'll be back - a good prime rib place is important to have in LV...just before a visit to the Rhino!",2008-08-25 19:49:10

I arrived here with my family behind a group of about 10. I had read that it takes a long time to get your food here, and I was concerned that with that many people ahead of us, it would be an overly long wait. It actually worked in our favor, because it being our first time, we spend the entire time we were in line staring, gobsmacked, at the wall of options.

I appreciated the friendliness of the employees and their patience as they walked me through half a dozen questions to order my sandwich.

I went with the Dutch crunch, since everyone seems to rave about it. I liked that it kind of reminded me of a giraffe pattern, but I didn't really get the appeal. It was hard, and I ended up peeling half of it away. The halal chicken with a combination of sauces and cheese and onions and jalapeños was still yummy, minus half the bread.

I mean the bakery part yes, but the food isn't diner or cafe. They have an Asian menu, so expect that and not breakfast. They feature noodle soups, rice etc...The food is good, at least what I had was, which was the beef noodles. But their egg rolls are just ok, sub par really.

Last Saturday morning I woke up to the sweltering heat and all I could think of was the 5 Margheritas I drank the night before and how I wished all the singing birds and playing children in my beautiful neighborhood would SHUT THE HELL UP.
My plan to buy out the city of muzzles and place them single-handedly on every kid and canine on my Street did not seem practical so I went to Trinity Bellwoods park with my my pug instead (and no, even he wasn't wearing a muzzle).

The park is absolutely lovely, green, sweeping and full of picnicking couples, who probably picked up food from the plethora of restaurants located just across the street, enjoying the break from the hustle and bustle of the city even in the centre of it (the park is located in the trendy Queen and Bathurst area).  There is also an off-leash area where the dogs and owners congregate safely in a deep, valley-like section of the park. However, beware dog parents: DO NOT take your dog off leash anywhere else in the park or you are likely to get a ticket by an eager cop hiding within Trinity's lush greenery hoping to make his quota.

Bellwoods is, in other words, a healthy cure for a hangover and if it doesn't work, there is always Chippy's - a famous spot for Fish N' Chips - directly across the street.",2008-08-26 20:44:28

The G O O G L E reviews on this place are pretty decent (4.1 stars) and people have recommended it on F A C E B O O K.... that's mostly why I wanted to check it out.

Outside is pretty. The pictures online (yelp/Facebook/avictorias.com) does not do this place justice. Even the chapel with the clouds on it, that I thought looked super tacky and disgusting online, is gorgeous. I was shocked that I liked it.... the only thing that I don't care for in this place is the carpet.... it's a bunch of circles.... like a geometry book exploded on it or something.

We walk into the main lobby, where a very polite woman paged Doug.... While waiting, we see a VERY LARGE ROACH. It was dead, but it's still stuck in my mind....it was just laying there. Like no one had stopped to sweep it away. Even after we told the woman in the front office, nothing was done about it.....Gross.

Doug comes out from the back, in sunglasses, a tank top, sweat pants and flip flops.....He was very apologetic, and told me that he forgot about our appointment, and that he had just came from the gym... 

This annoyed and confused me at first, because he was very persistent in scheduling a time for me to take a tour, he called me twice just a few hours apart one day.

.Throughout the visit, he kept apologizing, and I told him that, I was over it. He had at least shown up (early, might I add) ... You don't have to be in a tux to show me around the place....on my wedding, however, is a different story. 

Reading other people's reviews, I asked him about rehearsals, and tasting (menu items and cake), he said that they would be no problem, and that they are ****free of charge.*****

This place also has an elevator to go up into the bigger room (since my wedding most likely is going to be at least 100).....this is nice to see, because I have some elderly, and handicapped company, and those who have a trouble with walking/doing stairs.... it is a small, scary ride with the four of us on there, so the elevator operator will be making a few trips...

I also looked around at the chairs, and none of them seemed to be broken.... nor did I see any evidence of glue either.... as listed in a previous complaint.

 My mother is highly allergic to corn, and corn syrup... which is pretty much in everything now a days... and she asked if she could bring her own wine, due to her allergies, she would have no problem supplying my ""wedding wine"". Doug said that would be no problem... that he would cut out the expense for the wine, and not charge extra for his staff to serve it.

For an all inclusive wedding, ceremony, photography, dinner, cake, flowers, decor, centerpieces, linens, DJ, it was a pretty decent price for 100 people($8500). He told me that kids 5 and under he doesn't charge for... he would just need a count a head of time... which sounds good to me, because my daughter is 8 months old now, my soon to be mother in law has 4 children under the age of 6, and my fiance's uncle has 9, (yes NINE) children ranging from 2-17.


I disliked their centerpieces.... Doug said that if I wanted to get crafty, he would have no problem with me doing my own centerpieces and bringing them in.... 
Of course, if I do book here, I would get ALL OF THIS IN WRITING....before I would book with them, or even dare put money down......

............I think that is where a lot of brides (and people in general) make mistakes, and why they are unhappy with the result.. 

I'll admit, he did kind of give that ""used car salesman"" speech. But that's what businesses do, SALES. He has the run down....down.... I'm sure it gets pretty repetitive on what the appetizer(s) are.",2013-08-16 01:00:09

I usually do a Pro's / Con's review, but I can't think of a single con other than the fact that you may have to wait a couple of weeks if you are not flexible in order to get an appointment because they stay booked.

I picked Innovative Eye Care because of all the positive reviews I had read on Yelp. I was very pleased to find that the reviews were spot on. I scheduled my appointment through the web site, within 30 minutes the office called to verify my information, see if the dates I picked were good for me and when I asked about an earlier date they immediately told me of other options if I could do a different time. 

I would have to say the one thing that makes Innovative Eye Care a great experience is the time the staff and Doctor take to make sure you have a full understanding of your vision and overall eye health. It is rare now to find a doctor in any field that will actually spend time talking to you and not making you feel like a number as they rush to get to the next patient.

The patio is still in my opinion one of the best in Charlotte. It's HUGE and they have added a nice little bar out there. It's a great place for day drinking. They also have live music on some nights. Plenty of heaters available for chilly nights.

Mondays are still the night to go. Kennedy's has raised the price for all you can eat crab legs, but it still can't be beat. Great deal at $24.95. Thankfully, they did stop taking reservations on Mondays. This makes the process so much easier for both the restaurant and patrons. I haven't had to wait since they stopped holding tables.

If the Kennedy's parking lot is full, you can park at the other lots by Jack's and Philosopher's. Avoid the lot across the street from Jack's where the sub place is. They boot cars there left and right.

The fella and I had a downtown Pineville night and stopped by on a Saturday evening... unknown to us, the Christmasville festival thingy was going on, so the place was hopping when we stopped in around 5:30. 

We grabbed a couple of seats at the bar and were immediately greeted by one of the three bartenders (one of whom was Kit himself) and given a draft list. It felt pretty darn cozy inside; the decor is beer-related, but it feels like a comfy living room in a weird way. I also immediately noticed all the racks and coolers of beer lining the walls.

The fella is a complete beer snob (we go to Belgium every other year for him to get his fix), and he was pretty impressed by the draft list and retail options which included a Kasteel Tripel, a fave he always has a hard time finding at other Charlotte stores. I was impressed that the draft list had 5 different ciders (local and national) since bars rarely cater to us cider drinkers.  The fella got a North Coast Old Rasputin on nitro, which was solid. They also served wine and a few snacks.

Overall, I feel like this is going to become a go-to spot for us, and at the risk of comparing, we'll definitely choose it over Pintville. It seems like Kit's Trackside Crafts already knows what it wants to be, and it's aiming high and hitting some awesome beers on tap and in the store.

We built our zones online and they were delivered surprisingly in less than 45 minutes, which was good.

My zone cost nearly $9, I knew steak was an upcharge but it seemed oddly expensive and the website did not have an itemized list of the upcharges for various ingredients.

This is the ONLY Cambodian restaurant in all of Arizona, says Yut, the owner's (cook) son who works here.  I came here many times from only myself, 2 other eating buddies, and several times with larger groups of 10 or more (MeetUps).

Pretty much all the people I ate with agree, that the amount of food on the entree you ordered, is rather skimpy for the price that you pay.  For instance I felt sorry that one person in our large group of 10, generously passed his slice beef entree for everyone to try.  After each person took a piece, his dish that he was paying for, was all gone, and he was left with the rice.  

And for this small amount of food for the price, you have to wait a long time for it, so be prepared, if you eat with a group of more than 4 and they are busy, some will be done eating their order, while other people are still waiting for their order to be delivered to the table.  This is because there is only one cook (mom) and person in the kitchen (daughter?) to help her and son who serves the food outside the kitchen.  

If you wanna not wait so long, I would go on an off hour,like 2:30 pm and not during regular lunch and dinner on the weekends.  

Also if you want to show up with a group of 12 or more than 10, you either wait a very long time or they will tell you they cannot serve you.  If you want to make reservations for more than 10, you have to agree that they cookyou a pre-selected menu, each table eats the same dishes that they cook in advance ""family style"".  Each table has to eat the same pre-selected set.  That is what I was told by Yut a couple of years ago, and things have not changed in space.  One time we had a group of 15 (3 tables of 5) eating pre-selected dishes as described, and after 2.5 hours, we were about to leave, and the last dish still had not come out of the kitchen.  Another time we ate here with a group of 10, but not pre-selected menu in advance.  We all ordered when we arrived.   Other than another 4 people at a booth on this Wed night, we were the only ones in the restaurant.  Still took a long time, meaning some people finished eating, and saying goodbye, while others had not gotten their food yet.  So don't go here with a large group unless you are OK with ""waiting"" and not eating together.  They have a very small kitchen and one mom to cook for you, seemingly one dish at a time.    

There USED to be a sign at the door asking you for your patience, that every dish is prepared from scratch just for you, so begs your patience in waiting time, some words to that effect.  but the sign was not there July 2017.

Otherwise I rate the taste of the food 4 stars, service 2-3 stars (cos of incidents like serving a large bowl of soup without giving us bowls, running out of bowls and water glasses, and another time serving soup without thinking about giving us spoons, and very slow service, even tho service was polite).  

Value for dollar 2 stars.  So altogether 3 stars.  

Since it is important to ME to have value for price (which truly authentic  Chinese restaurants at least are good at providing, or REAL Chinese would not eat there), and me being Chinese, the food here is not so tasty for me to be a repeat customer here again and again.  But I tell you my favorite dish is the lemon grass soup with coconut milk, and I order a bowl or rice to add more contents into the soup, as I said they are not very generous with ingredients in a dish.  It makes a meal for me without having to order something else.",2018-04-04 22:35:45

When we walked in, the owner was the one taking the orders. He asked if we had been there before, and when we said no, he explained the whole menu to us. He was SO personable! After we had gotten our food, he checked on our table outside to see how everything was. His service was outstanding, and I wish every place I went to had this great of service. It also helps that is french accent is to DIE for ;)

Ok, so onto the meal. I had the chicken pesto sandwich special. It was FULL of flavor. Sundried tomato pesto really made the whole sandwich pop. The bread was fresh, soft and chewy. It matched the sandwich perfectly. The chicken was delicious as well. It was perfectly cooked, and not dry. I seriously can't even say how awesome this place is! 

My table also split the chocolate tart. Can you say HEAVEN? Cause that's where I was when I was devouring it. It's rich and creamy. The slice was HUGE, and enough for 4 people to share.  I kinda want to go back just for that! 

If you haven't been here, you need to come STAT. Like I said, I wish it was open on the weekends cause I would be here every Saturday for lunch!",2012-11-08 22:14:16

Management has changed since then, so did the food and service. I work next door so it's a walking distance for me to get lunch. I don't have a personal favorite but DO try any of their lunch special. Ranges from $6-$7.50ish. There's a $10 limit on cards but sometimes they may forgive you if you don't have cash. 

I've tried almost everything on their lunch menu. Well, I usually eat off of my co-workers' take out lunches. Busy days are Fridays and Mondays around lunch. Just FYI. But it's a great place for a sit down restaurant for something quick and cheap.",2012-12-07 23:23:13

Either Prime or Bellagio restaurant reservations somehow lost my reservation I made for my anniversary night. I called that night to inform them we'd be 15-20 mins late, that's when I found out they weren't expecting us. So of course, they already gave away the window seats I requested. It was an understatement to say I was upset. I made these reservations weeks ago...

However, when we arrived, the prime windows seat for 2 people were taken, but there was one still left, and they sat us there. Even though for some reason, the traditional water show did not go off, we were delighted to get the table with the view.

Dinner was phenomenal. From the rib eye to the chocolate cake at the end, it was great. The restaurant is beautiful. Our server, Beau, was attentive, efficient, and friendly, ending our dinner with a complimentary dessert to congratulate us on our anniversary. 

A definitely must...
Thank you, Prime Steakhouse staff!",2012-04-02 19:02:15

When we come on our own, we hike Turtle (easy to start, steep in the middle, and more manageable near the top). 

When we bring friends who aren't necessarily into doing a real hike, we simply drive the loop and stop for pictures here and there. 

It's also really fun to simply climb around this place, even just doing the small stuff that doesn't require equipment. The rock is easily grip-able with just about any kind of shoe. And we've taken children as young as three who have felt safe and really enjoyed themselves. 

Be warned that this place can get decently buy as it is a tourist spot. This means it can be hard to find parking, hard to take pictures or that the loop might take forever to drive because the person in front of you is going 5 miles an hour.",2017-02-20 15:36:42

-Chicken/Turkey Jalapeno Sausage
-Duck Fat Fries with Wvrst Sauce

The Chicken/Turkey Sausage I would give 3 stars because it had a lot less flavor than I expected and was fairly dry. It was not a juicy as my friend's who got a pork sausage. The roll got pretty soggy by the time I finished it too.

The Duck Fat Fries get 5 stars, SO good. Really tasty with just the right amount of crunchy, salty goodness. Didn't really need the sauce because they were so good, but the sauce was good too

There are some cons that I dislike about this gym.  This gym didn't open on time, where it was advertised at the other gym on 67th and Peoria that it was to open at the end of July 2016.  That was something I was looking forward to only to find out on a notice on the window that the opening date was pushed back.  The biggest qualm here with me is that there is no sauna or jacuzzi here.  This is one of the main reasons I love the gym because of its amenities.  

So if you're looking for a sauna or jacuzzi, this gym isn't for you.  The pool is also considerably smaller as well.  As a whole, this gym is a lot smaller than the old location on 67th and Peoria.  I do like that it is modern and has wooden floors, but that's about it.  The gym is ok and will do because it's close to my house.  There are also fewer machines of everything, which is probably due to lack of space.  No raquetball courts here either.  Overall, a nice looking gym lacking several key amenities.  I am still scratching my head at the sauna/jacuzzi situation.",2016-08-25 19:03:47

The other day and stopped by on a busy Saturday night. We could find parking and after walking in, there was about a 45 minute wait. Not a big deal, I expected to wait a bit. 

What a cool building. Everything from the outside to the lighting above the bars, the exposed brick and wood everywhere you look. Beautiful. They did a top notch job on the décor. I didn't take a look around the whole place, but from what I saw I loved the style. We waited at the bar where I had a blueberry beer.  I liked it. I ordered a peach beer but they were all out. The hostess and bartender were both very kind. 

Once we sat down our waiter was awesome, very attentive. We ordered a few apps. The duck quesadillas, burger sliders and mozzarella balsamic flat bread. I wasn't a fan of the first two options, the food seem like it was trying too hard, but I did enjoy the flat bread.

It may be because I hyped it up so much that when the food was just mediocre I was shocked.  For lunch I ordered the tofu and mushroom burger with Vegan bacon, and a cup of miso soup. Almost $12 deep for lunch, I was expecting heaven in my mouth... more like a crumbly mess at my desk.  The burger had good flavor, but it was a little dry and would not hold its form. There was some sort of vegan mayonnaise spread on top, but it still needed some kind of sauce... bbq or ketchup, anything! It was such a mess that I decide to skip the bun and eat with a fork and knife.  The vegan bacon on top was very good, although it didn't remind me of  bacon flavor (though my frame of reference may be off since it's been almost 20 years since I've had real bacon!).   The soup definitely earned a solid 4 stars, it was very hearty and had a lot of veggies for a miso soup.  Inside the restaurant was a little scandalous, similar to a coffee shop I might frequent in college.  Given it's in a newer location I was expecting a cleaner, more modern interior.

As for the food, the sushi quality is average at best. The enoki mushroom was drenched in butter (which you would think would be amazing!) and a bit salty, so... meh.

It was around 5pm Saturday night and we got there we were told that seating in the opened patio area (by the fire pits & fire place) is a self-serve area and that the bar outside was not opened yet that we would need to go inside to order drinks & food so we opted to be waiting on and found a table in the covered patio area.

 After inquiring what they had on tap I went with a Wasatch Apricot Hefeweizen , I have to say, this is a pretty good beer, my favorite is the Four Peak's Peach Ale, and well this one comes in a close 2nd.

After drinks were ordered it was time to figure out the food, we ordered 2 pizzas, the Sister Margarite and the Mahalo. The pizzas came out one at a time, don't know if there was a backup in the kitchen.

The Sister Margarite was the 1st pizza to reach our table, it was your basic marinara sauce, roma tomatoes, garlic & basil and cheese. I really didn't care for this pizza, it just tasted bland.

Then the 2nd pizza came out when the 1st one was done, did they think the boys wouldn't have put away both pizzas? I have to say the 2nd pizza was delish, it had Applewood Smoked BACON and sweet pineapples, this was a yummy pizza.

Looove the atmosphere and decor - very modern and chic, especially with the sofas for some of the seating; could be a nice date place. It's a two story restaurant, and it was nice sitting at the top level overseeing the first floor. I'd want to come back for drinks! 

SERVICE - servers were quite attentive and friendly . My water was always filled (i don't even notice it was being filled half the time). There were always servers around (and it wasnt like the place was empty). And i thought it was great that they would make chit chat with you while walking you to your table etc which not a lot of people do at restaurants that I've been to; makes you feel quite welcome.

FOOD - for $28, I thought the selection and quality was quite good for Winterlicious! I've been to other places for this price and the food was subpar. I got a salmon poke cocktail with a passionfruit sauce for my app - mmmmm I hope they have this on their regular menu.

Entree wise, I got a flat iron steak. This was quite tender and very juicy, thumbs up. And I ended off with a gouda cheese plate for dessert - just your standard cheese plate. The other people in my party had a peanut butter panna cotta which was quite unique (kinda wished I tried that)!

I tried a couple of other sandwiches too (thank you for that opportunity, Groupon!)... but my inner voice was not nearly as pleased with those sandwiches as it was with the milanesa.  On a different note, I was approached in the parking lot by a homeless-looking man asking for change... but I don't hold that against this place, as I am sure he was just trying to scrounge up enough pesos to afford a milanesa sandwich to go with his 40 oz Dos Equis!

There was a little bit on mine so, I was told that all of these other parts were affected, because of hte oxidation they were going to snap off, and they couldnt touch it. No recommendations on how to get the oxiation of. Referred me to a mechanic that charges $80 to touch your car if it is oxidized.... and JIC money if parts snap off...
I went to Jiffy Lube instead. THey cleaned the oxidation.. took 5 seconds and changed my battery. Nothing snapped off.

Second:
I needed a new gas cap because I have been getting a false reading of the gas cap not being closed.
I talked to one of the Autozoners asked if I needed to get a Gas Cap, or if there was just a part.. (i really don't know about cars and I don't try to hide it)

The blue cheese fig panini we ordered was lackluster. The bread wasn't very high quality and I thought the flavors were a bit too sweet for me personally. I thought it was very strange that our server actually told us that no one orders that and the cook was shocked when he gave him our order... not a good sign!

I did appreciate that our server took the time to ask how the food was and asked us for honest feedback, which we gave. He did say he would take note of the bread for next time and possibly add some arugula to the panini. 

I will say the wine selections were priced great - and we did enjoy our bottle.

ceviche - very good
mussels/sausage app - this could be a meal in itself, great broth
pastrami - great ingredients/bread
sweet potato fries - these were perfect, crisp and came with a delicious dipping sauce

Server was great, there was a bit of a wait for the food but I think their kitchen is really small so that can't really be helped. She kept us informed of the delay and the owner was there both times keeping an eye on things.

First of all, the staff is just phenomenal. The people who work here care deeply about the installations and getting to know the intricacies of each piece. They are helpful in assisting however they can to make your experience worthwhile.

When I tell people about The Mattress Factory, I often get the response, ""I wish I understood art more."" or ""I wish I were an art person who could *get* it."" The reality is, there's nothing to ""get"" at TMF. It is the kind of experience that makes you FEEL. It is internal, personal, and always difficult for me to talk about. It's not a place I go to muse over what someone ""meant"" to convey. It's a place I go to seek out FEELING the art, sometimes literally, and thinking about those emotions that come out of each piece. 

For me, experiencing the exhibits is overwhelming in the best possible way. If I want to get away from reality, this is what I like to do. It's truly a unique and special place in that way, and if you are open to it, you can learn so much without ""understanding"" art. I use quotation marks quite purposefully here. 

The Mattress Factory displays provocative art that stimulates in a way that I have never experienced at any other kind of museum. 

Aside from the art itself, the gift shop is also fantastic. I need to go back ASAP and pick some things up, but I HIGHLY recommend the candles from the local maker who bases them off classic and children's books. They are beautifully crafted and smell phenomenal. This gift shop is easily one of the best! I'd even go there just for that if it were more accessible to where I live.

Or...you just want to get some great tasting Fish and Chips or Breakie!

They have awesome F&C.  They also do a great all day breakie, hamburgers, and other ""foods.""  Generous portions is an understatement here.  However, you will be out CA$H!  Halibut and Chips runs you about $20 before tax and tips.  Yikes!  Also, whether you order breakie with 1, 2, or three eggs...same price.

I usually get one order of fish and chips as we can share.  Today, there was 5 of us, and we ordered double fish with chips and a 3 egg Breakie.  That was it.  More than enough food.  The guy behind us had an order of F&C and a hamburger platter!  Wow insanity!

Enjoy responsibly....

The wait is not too bad and if you do not want to wait long, just go to their website and check-in so when you walk inside you just tell them your name and usually you are the first one up depending how busy they are. I always check the wait time online and it is usually accurate.

I receive coupons from them every once in awhile and they are really marvelous deals. I request a pretty simple hair cut and the majority of the time it goes well. 

Some of the stylist actually take the time and make sure you are overall satisfied with the cut and if there are any adjustments to be made.

- Located in the same shopping plaza as Cost Plus, Aaron Bros., and Barnes & Noble, on Rainbow, between Lake Mead and Smoke Ranch.
- From the time we walked in to the time we walked out, service was excellent.
- We opted for the hibachi dinner.  Hing was our chef and we had him all to ourselves.  He was very entertaining and had some mad skills with the utensils, swirling and swinging them as well as making the food catch fire, in a good way.
- I had the shrimp and chicken combo dinner, which came with soup (onion or miso) and a small salad to start.  
- Brown rice is available!
- 5 ounces of chicken and at least 4 ounces of shrimp for my dinner.  Mel got the filet mignon and salmon for his.
- Vegetables included mushrooms, onions, carrots, and broccoli.
- Everything was very tasty.
- For his finale, Hing did that thing where he tries to catapult a piece of food into your open mouth.  For us, he took one of my shrimp, cut it into three pieces and flung one piece at the b/f.  Missed on the first try, made it on the second.  My turn:  missed and the shrimp piece landed in my napkin--I ate it.
- Our dinner came to $52 minus the $40 Groupon = deal.  AND, they gave us a $10 gift card to use on the next visit!
- The place is very nicely decorated and spotless.  Even the bathroom is elegant and pristine.

My appointment was with David C for my deep tissue, 2 hour massage. He did an amazing job preparing my muscles for the deep tissue experience.

I would highly recommend him...especially if you are staying at The Wynn and can go up to your room afterward for a totally wonderful nap!

I opted for the two hours because I really wanted to have enough attention to my neck and back. He spent an hour just on my back and neck and then the rest of the time concentrating on everywhere else.

I realize there's a great debate on what's better BBQ in Pittsburgh, but I honestly think there's an array of different kinds, that can range from good to mediocre. This is definitely on the good end!

I got the meal of 3 ribs, 2 wings and 2 sides. Momma came HUNGRY! But really I just chalk it up to the ribs and wings not being much meat. 

The ribs were great. I tried the beef ribs, so while two had a decent amount of meat on them, one did not. But the smoked flavor itself ALMOST warranted no sauce. Almost. But that's just because I love sauce too much... I couldn't not have it. And the mild sauce I tried was the right combo of spicy and sweet. I thought the wings were good, but had very little meat on it. The breaking was really good though. How do you choose between meat and breading?

The sides were all great too. I split 2 other sides with a friend as well. Usually there's always a mix of good and bad, but all were good. I think the best was the sweet potato casserole. It tasted like pie, it was just incredible! The greens were great and the cornbread was too. Usually I find cornbread dry, so I was happy this wasn't. The only two that were okay were the mac n cheese and beans, but they weren't bad by any means.

Fishy, Mahi Mahi should not NOT taste fishy especially when it has BBQ sauce to mask the flavor of the Fish, still fishy tasting!  The Menu said it was Mahi, so maybe it was a mistake, we made one too!  Glad to say neither of us became physically ill!

The Mashed Potatoes were so Cold as if they came out of the Refrigerator... Equally as disappointing as the worst parts of the meal!

What is cooler than cold, Tacos at Cabo Fish Taco!  Some food is like Revenge (better when served COLD)!  If they could make everything as good as their Corn Salsa I would be giving them closer to two or three yelp stars!

My Beer Battered Shrimp Taco (the Dish that used to be good here) was the best part of the meal and it was not very good!  The Wrap was COLD and the sauce had little flavor!

Here is how they approach the question they should have asked ""How was your meal?""?  Instead they say : ""Everything's good isn't it""?  They noticed we did not eat very much!  They knew we did not enjoy it!

However lately I've noticed the employees not only stopped acknowledging me, but also they're not as happy-go-lucky as before, as in they get agitated quite easily. It could be a sign the boss is being a little greedy and not giving the employees a share of the tips.

Not that I think people are going to bookmark this or anything, but here goes. I never ever ever shopped at Walgreens for anything other than prescriptions until 2014. I felt they were over priced and really couldn't imagine who would waste their time there. And then... Dun da da! I randomly started Couponing, and my entire Walgreens perspective changed! I now shop Walgreens weekly, and I'm only slightly embarrassed to say I'm often seen shopping there multiple times a week! Some might say I'm a Walaholic.

So here's the lowdown on this Wags location. Annette in cosmetics is the sweetest, nicest, most patient and helpful cashier I've ever dealt with! She bar none, hands down makes this location my #1 favorite Walgreens on the West side (trust me I frequent them all). The management here is also very nice, they know me, smile and say hi not because they have to, but because they are genuinely happy to see me. This is my own little Cheers! Everyone at this location is friendly, they are helpful, and unlike other locations the sale tags are always properly marked.

Now about those high prices... If you run in and grab something for convenience, which I'm sure most do, yes you'll pay an arm and a leg, but that can be said of any store I suppose. However if you watch their sale flyer, check their monthly coupon book, and sign up for their rewards program and learn to use it, you'll find there are TONS of items very cheap or even free *yes FREE* (after rewards i.e. points or Register Rewards). I get that not everyone coupons, but if you do you know Walgreens is a mainstay.

This location has a designated clearance section where you'll often find great name brand items for a fraction of the cost! Months ago I stocked up on Toni & Guy hair products they were closing out and actually made money on them after earning rewards points!

One final tip: when buying food at any Walgreens, always check the expiration date as food items don't turn over stock as often as drugs and personal care here. Happy shopping!",2015-03-05 03:13:40

Well he did after he told us no problem hooking up the ice maker to the reverse osmosis waterline (FYI that's something Home Depot won't do). We were sold a water kit for city waterline for .01 because the salesman could do that. .01 to remove and take away the old fridge! We were originally promised the following Saturday delivery. The salesman handed me the paper and no one checked that delivery was going to be a week later. 

FYI he even sent a nice postcard to us (see pictures) saying how great it was to work with us. When I called back a few days later he though my wife was my sister! That's messed up. 

I questioned why we didn't get a call the first week. Then I looked at the receipt. I called Home Depot to inquire once again about the waterline and that's when I found out the salesman misinformed us! The lady in sales for appliances that night was so rude etc. I called back and spoke to Dave the manager about her. I also spoke to him about the water line and he said if we gave him heads up maybe he could have done something about it. He said Home Depot can reimburse us for the hookup just bring him a receipt. I arranged to have our handyman and a few backups if necessary. 

Well a week later came and I got a call from the delivery company ""Barlow's"" (go read that review!) on that Friday night for Saturday delivery. Still I had a chance to try and schedule someone to hook up the waterline. Saturday morning I got s call from Barlow saying that the drivers called out. I was like no way! The delivery co person was really rude and tried to push a Tuesday delivery (we work no way). I called Home Depot to complain there was nothing at all they could do. The delivery company was even allowing people to go pick up their orders due to this delay. Home Depot didn't have the proper truck nor the inclination to drive to Tolleson. 

I then called the delivery company back and scheduled for the following week and asked Tiffany to schedule it in the morning. She even promised a gift card and more for our troubles. (Never got gift card) Tiffany promised to see what she could do. I called Home Depot and spoke to Nicole another manager and she said she will see what she could do about it. Nicole had Dave call to say he will come and connect the hose to the fridge and he instructed Barlow to call him before delivery.

I called Barlow Friday afternoon. Around 5:00 and rude April answered the phone and started looking up the order and I was asking for Tiffany to help me. She didn't transfer me. About 5 mins later the phone rang and Tiffany said between 4:00 - 8:00. OMG what part of customer service to they not get. Well she transferred me to a Shaun and she wouldn't budge.  

I then had a third plan and that was accept delivery and have Home Depot come Monday but after thinking about it that was a stupid idea on my part. 

I stirred over the situation and contacted Dave at Home Depot because this was just a Mickey moused situation. I told him I was considering cancelling the entire thing and he told me he hopes that I won't cancel the order and to come see him and he will personally give us a discount for other appliances we will eventually replace.

My wife and I were very disappointed with Home Depot and Barlow delivery that after dinner we went to another appliance store. 

Guess what? They hook up to RO systems and had an even better refrigerator than what Home Depot was selling us. We had enough left over to buy a microwave.

FYI I spent a lot of time of the phone with Barlow and Home Depot. More than I should have. Was never offered any compensation for my aggravation except for above discount on future order. We don't know when we are going to order a stove and dishwasher. 

Cancelling with Home Depot wasn't bad but it did take a phone call or 2 to do it. I saw the credit back to the Home Depot card I'm only going to use for simple items if any.  Don't buy appliances that Home Depot won't personally deliver and install.

I spent way too much time on phone with all of this and not even an I'm sorry or anything from the store. Just I hope you try us again for your next appliances. We promise to give you a great price.

FYI go to Lowe's they give 5% off always by using their credit card!",2018-06-20 02:10:19

You'd think with a name like that they'd have a REAL coffee machine to make Café con Leche, Cafesito, Expresso which are available in EVERY Colombian bakery/restaurant, except this one. They have drip coffee which is blasphemous for a latin bakery/ restaurant! 

 Moving on to the complimentary platanitos (plantain chips)  which is also unusual for a Colombian restaurant as they would typically serve warm bread w/butter, except this restaurant. 

As we placed our order I asked for frijoles rojos (red beans) which EVERY Colombian restaurant has, except this one. I then asked for lentejas(lentils) which EVERY Colombian restaurant has, except this one. I even asked the server if they were sure they're a Colombian restaurant. 

 My Carne Asada Steak was extremely thin and lacking flavor, the rice was up to standard and the ONLY beans they offered were Pinto Beans which are typically available in Peruvian restaurants. 

The Churrasco (Sirloin Steak) wasn't bad and actually had some seasoning. The maduros were ripe and good, but you cannot be a REAL Colombian restaurant and not have RED BEANS or LENTILS!

I never did ""develop a taste"" for beer.

Soft drinks and cola are still a great love and for that reason I am grateful to Joseph James for producing what could possibly be the finest cola I have ever tasted - ""Joe's Cola"". I first picked it up at Whole Foods but recently it's become available at Glazier's too and I hope the popularity just keeps growing because I can't get enough. The cola uses cane sugar instead of the high fructose corn syrup that makes soft drinks just taste weird to someone like me who grew up with cane sugar. Joe's is pleasantly mellow and not overly carbonated, while retaining a rich cola flavour with a back-taste that's almost like a hint of honey.

Like most people say, this place can be hard to find--it's on Broadway and Hardy right across the street from the industrial district. It has a yellow sign that says ""Taqueria"" on it. Why it doesn't say Sombreros, we'll never know. 

I had a vegetarian burrito which came with corn, rice, black beans (of which you get to choose from two types of bean), lettuce, and some spicy sauce they had. You also get to choose from a chipotle, spinach, flour, or corn tortilla. I had the spinach and it was very tasty. Came with a side of some old, forgettable tortilla chips as well. The total was 6 bucks EXACTLY, which made the OCD part of my brain shiver with delight. You might refer to this place as a cheaper, possibly healthier ""Chipotle."" 

The decorations and furnishings inside are nice, modern with a touch of old-world Mexico. The three ladies working behind the counter lend the place a very authentic feel--it's quite obvious these three have made a LOT of tortillas in their lifetimes.

The shrimp wonton was wrapped in thinnly rolled skins.   The fish soup base was light and flavourful with a lot of fresh diced scallions.  The noodles was a big no no for me.

I'd been to a BBQ fire pit restaurant in Japan and had been wanting to try one here ever since. They don't have open flames, but a grill you place your food on, and huge seating areas.
Everything in is Japanese and English, and most things are pictured for those who aren't sure what is what. Since we were in a hurry I ordered only one plate of squid, and he got a beef bowl with Miso soup.
For about seven bucks the squid size was pretty good, and they give you yummy sauces to dip them in. The grill gets pretty hot so the food cooks fast and thorough.
My boyfriend seemed to like his beef bowl, which had chunks of seasoned beef on top of veggies and rice. He lamented that they did not have tempura bananas, like pretty much all sushi places have- but this is  authentic Japanese cuisine, so they won't have that stuff. 
They do, however, have real Black Sesame Mochi ice cream (it does not say on the menu, but they do have it) for 3$ for 2 pieces. Way better than sushi house prices, plus it is SO good! I've been waiting to find Black Sesame ice cream since being in Japan, and finally found it here, whoot!

I informed the waiter about my allergies to certain weeds (shitlantro) and he recommended a dish for me. Now, I won't die if I get cilantro, but it's kind of unpleasant to my body and it tastes like soap. I got a few bites in and he came running to the table panicking about how the sauce turns out to have cilantro in it. He sent the manager over who recommended a new dish, didn't charge me for either, and then gave me another drink which was hella strong.

The fact that they showed so much concern even though I explained to them that it's not a fatal allergy unless I get a fair amount in me, shows me that they care about their clients. 

The replacement dish, the mahi-mahi in a cream mango sauce, was absolutely to die for. Especially with a strawberry mojito. (the mango one was pretty bad, but was accidentally brought to my table by an errant waitress and I just took it rather than my strawberry one)

Then came the menu...also a very unique thing compared to what we are used to. Basically the menu is made up of raw selection (oysters, sashimi etc.), small plates perfect for sharing tapas style, select entrees and daily specials. We hit a number of expertly prepared small plates and one of the specials: Chicken Fried Lobster. It was excellent as were the accompanying grilled pork belly, Kimchi fried rice and Shishito peppers with cauliflower and pistachios. Everything was excellent

The soup was more parmentier than leek, but let's be realistic, it's just soup. The bread was crusty. The salad was plain Boston lettuce with a vinaigrette and some walnuts, but dressed correctly and dry before the vinaigrette was added, so it isn't watery.

Plus he's been great about hosting food truck events in the parking lot, promoting other food trucks that may or may not be lesser known.  He's not afraid of a little competition. :) From talking to him, I think he's worked out the kinks in his service system when big groups show up for the food truck events.  Basically, you'll just wait in line long but get your food faster, like how Slider Truck operates.  Ever notice how the order guy for Slider Truck disappears for a while each time after taking an order?  He's managing the tickets so the nice gentlemen cooking the food don't get slammed.

As much as we love KBBQ, we don't go often because my family hates smelling like meat and these restaurants lack proper ventilation. This one was no exception. 

Kookminhakgyo means Elementary School in Korean. The decor inside reflects that as once inside, there are paintings of little kids along what it looks like school work on their wall. The restaurant is located in a small plaza on Yonge St. between Finch Ave. and Steeles Ave. The parking is problematic as there are only a very limited amount so street parking is the other option. 

The restaurant has round metal drums for tables with a burner in the middle. The seats are also small drums which you can store your jacket inside the barrel. There isn't much room on the table once your dishes arrives. The restaurant is not very big and all of the tables are close together. 

We decided to go with the Assorted Meat Platter: Pork skirt meat, pork shoulder butt, pork jowl meat, pork belly and pork belly with skin. This is supposed to be 800g of meat. It comes with banchan, sauces, a Kimchi soup with bean sprouts and egg. We also ordered an additional Bibimbap, Yukgaejang and a side order of white rice. The meats don't come with rice and is an additional cost. 

The quality of the meats were good along with the Bibimbap. They had a mixed up with our Yukgaejang order so they ended up not charging us and giving us soft drinks as an apology. We never even asked for that and they simply did it themselves. We were surprised and grateful. 

However, this place is not cheap and the quantity of the food might be a bit lacking. It really didn't feel like you were getting a big amount. The washrooms are in the basement and semi clean. They have one for male and female. 

We had excellent service from the waitresses though and thus brought the rating up for this place. 

Don't wear nice clothes as the ventilation is non existent and your eyes will hurt from all of the smoke from the cooking.

Tasty House is another one of those Hong Kong Style Cafe in the Scarborough area. However, after coming here for lunch, I am going to make it my to go place when I am in the area. 

Cheap pricing of course is almost the main attraction for HK style Cafe patrons.. but aside from prices, quality of food is really important too! Tasty House successfully kept their pricing low in line with the other Scarborough restaurants but the quality of food is way better! 

Eggs with Toast/Hot Dog with instant noodle/drink ($5.25) 
- Tasty House used the huge Grade A eggs.. 
- 2 Hot Dogs are of better quality too... 

Egg Sandwiches/Satay Beef Vermicelli with drink ($5.25) 
- Beef really tender and plentiful 
- Best Egg Sandwich I have ate in a HK Cafe.. cooked perfectly..a little runny and moist.. and the bread is the thick cut! :P 

All of the Baked with Protein (pork chop, beef, beef tongue etc) are all $6.95 with drinks. Which is really good value. 

Services here is fast and efficient! And of course Chinese TV show for your dining pleasure! 

CASH only!",2011-04-24 23:56:47

I am from Chicago and was married to an Italian.  I love Italian food,  and am considered quite a good cook.  The place is cute, and packed to the gills by 6:00, which we considered a good sign, even tho you would hardly recognize it as a restaurant from the outside.  

There was only one waiter for the back half of the restaurant where we were sitting, and he worked his buns off.  While overall we were there 1-1/2 hours,  we never felt ignored.  I started off with the snails in mushrooms, which were plentiful and pretty good.  A few too many crumbs in the sauce for my taste, but overall, good.  My husband had the roasted peppers for appetizer, and they were just that.  A plate of roasted green and red bell peppers with a little cheese on top.  Good, but better as an accompaniment for something else.  We were served warm bread, which we did use to sop up the sauces from the snails and peppers.

I had the pasta fagioli soup next, and it was a thick as library paste.  I ate a couple of bites, and that was all I could take.  My husband had a salad, which was nothing special altho fresh, and he said the vinegar and oil dressing was very good.  I tasted the little container of garlic dressing they gave him, and it was delicious.

I ordered meat lasagna for my entrée, which should be a safe bet in an Italian restaurant.  However, it was the poorest excuse for lasagna I have ever eaten.  There was almost no ricotta in the dish, over baked and dry, a couple of lasagna noodles with some kind of cheese between them and tons of overcooked, dry ground beef.  It was also very bland.  I didn't eat it.

My husband got one of the nightly specials, Chicken pepperoncini,  with pasta on the side.  He ate it and said it was okay, but not spectacular.  

I was really glad that we went there with a coupon from Restaurant.com, so we got a decent discount.  It is not an inexpensive restaurant. There were 4-5 veal dishes on the menu, and they were all $32.95.  They added 18% tip to our bill because of the coupon, and I didn't begrudge that at all, because the waiter did a great job with all the people he had to serve.

We may try it again sometime, because with so many people eating there, there must be a reason.  So maybe we just ordered the wrong things.  However, as I said, you have to wonder about an Italian restaurant that can't make lasagna.",2011-07-29 07:25:42

""Have you tried Carino? No? Me neither..."" Well, it was time for me to change all that! But after going once for brunch, I'm still a little confused by it. I very much enjoyed it but I'm still a little confused.

Gabi M. and I were the first ones into the restaurant for Sunday brunch starting at 10:00AM. Right in the middle of Edmonton trail, across the street from a packed Diner Deluxe and an OEB that seemed to have more people waiting to get in than in the restaurant itself, it was odd to find a brunch spot with no line. (She'd even tell you the same thing, right here: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/carino-japanese-bistro-wine-calgary?hrid=nRSp-f0hmXDox5Q3C0wPuA)

They serve a special brunch menu that is Japanese infused with North American style brunch. I had the Loco Moco, which is a bowl of Terayaki rice with a Wagyu beef burger patty on top and then a sunny-side egg on top of that. Gabi's review is spot on - I did quite enjoy it! My egg was cooked well, the burger remained tender and juicy, the rice was good and sticky to hold a well proportioned amount of Teriyaki. The food is very well made and attractively displayed. SO why is it that all the other brunch places along Edmonton Trail were lined up, but not Carino? While their menu definitely incorporates a touch of North American brunch (mostly adding an egg to everything) to an asian menu, there's something about it that just doesn't quite seem quite fulfilling if you had your heart set on brunch. Teriyaki rice is delicious, make no mistake about it! But adding an egg on top doesn't necessarily satisfy the brunch pangs the way I hoped it would.

I'm interested in going back to Carino and trying their evening service. A Japanese Italian mix is something I feel like I can get behind for any other meal of the day.

The space looks like it's set up more for evening service than it is for brunch. Classy black chandeliers, (laminate) hard wood floors, and side booth seating give it a lounge/wine bar feel.

The service is friendly, the space is nice and the food is good. I feel like Carino is a solid bet if you're feeling adventurous for brunch and desire North American inspire Japanese dishes, and not the other way around.",2015-01-20 06:04:29

The place was orderly and the atmosphere was cool.  It was completely different from your  typical ""bertos"" restaurant.  I bellied up to the salsa bar which was well stocked with a variety of salsas and other stuff.  What turned me off was the super thick layer of dust that accumulated on the top of the sneeze guard around the string of fake red chilies they were using as decoration.  I could just imagine the dust falling into the salsas and chips.  I usually look right past minor cleanliness issues but this was very obvious and in a bad location, right at eye level.  

The burrito was a good size, actually enough for two average eaters to split.  The eggs were well cooked and I enjoyed them using real potatoes rather than French fries in the burrito.  Pretty basic flavors for a machaca breakfast burrito.  It was well done but not outstanding.

Sapna G. speaks no word of a lie.  This place truly does have some of the nicest people I've ever encountered at a restaurant.  It seems the employees are always trying to make everyone's experience as pleasurable as possible, and they really pull it off.  It's nice to see a bunch of workers who don't hate their lives.

The thing I loved most about the Holy Grill was the beet chips.  I was a little hesitant to try them, since they look weird and purplish, but they turned out to be so scrumptious!  I also love that most of their burgers come with two patties... that's right, TWO patties!  I skeptically tried the ""Gourmet Burger"" when I went.  I say skeptically because there was blue cheese and I've never been a fan... but I wanted the avocado so I went for it.  I was surprised that, unlike other blue cheese meals, the taste wasn't too overpowering and actually gave it a nice taste.

I'll be going back to Holy Grill to try some other food.  I had such a difficult time making up my mind last time because everything seemed like it would be so delicious and really hit the spot.  And, for a well-sized meal for under $10, how can you go wrong?",2009-10-16 15:29:14

q2bCsXCqhh1-SUU_QC9iEg,qrqmuWzML9drT74Y05XqTg,OAUOUZB8xAbJlhnLJhlGYg,1,25,6,0,"Very disappointing! My family and I visited a large number of dealerships over the course of two weeks and Horne Kia was by far the worst!

I had been helping my sister shop for a new car and I came across a vehicle on Horne Kia's website that was the specific model and trim level I really wanted her to see.  It was listed on the Horne Kia website at $4,000 more than an identical car (same year/model/color/trim) listed at another dealer nearby, so I called ahead and spoke with ""Mike"".

We discussed the other, identical car and he said he ""might not be able to match the price of the competitor's car exactly"", but he promised he could ""get really close"".  I explained that I had to make arrangements with my sister and didn't want to make the drive clear across town if he wasn't absolutely certain that he could get very close to the competitor's price.  He said ""no problem, we can make it happen"" and told me to come on in.

I gathered my sister, my father and my wife and drove across town to see the vehicle.  Mike was there when we arrived, but he immediately handed us off to another salesperson, Eric, as Mike was helping someone else (even though I had informed him that we were on our way).

We took the test drive and my sister absolutely loved the car, as I expected.  Interested in the car, we went inside to talk numbers.

They started the ""deal"" at a higher price than was listed on the car!  I was a little put off by this, but it was the first round of negotiations, so I patiently explained the situation to Eric.  He left and returned a while later with an updated offer.  This time at FULL sticker price!  I said that obviously wasn't going to do.  He got a little sharp with us, but I made it clear we didn't want to play games, so he left again.  

After another wait, he returned with the dealership's ""Best Offer"".  The result? A discount of just $75.  I was as much confused as I was offended.

I again referred to the conversation with Mike and explained that a mere $75 discount on a $24,000 car was almost an insult. Eric said they couldn't do any better.  I explained that I was disappointed as we really liked the car and had hoped for better.  We got up from the table, shook Eric's hand and I informed him that we were going to leave. I asked for a manager's card before I left, which he then left to get.  

He made us wait a substantial amount of time, likely to see if we would leave on our own without the manager's card.  However, we continued to wait.  When he finally returned, instead of bringing the manager's card, he brought Mike.  

Mike proceeded to confront us about the failed sale.  He changed what he had said, suggested that we didn't know how things work (I've helped friends and family buy more than 20 cars from dealerships...I know how it works) and even went so far as to claim I was making up most of the conversation we had earlier that day!  My father became upset, as he had been sitting with me when I made the call to Mike and had overheard the entire thing.  

I reminded Mike that the only reason I had made arrangements for all of us to come down and endured the drive was because of what he had told me on the phone and I wasn't interested in arguing, we just wanted to leave.  

Unable to accept fault to any degree, Mike persisted.  Every time he opened his mouth, it made us feel less appreciated.

I stated that we had been looking forward to making a deal that day and I didn't understand why they would approach us like this as we were leaving.  He was spending more time butting heads with us than trying to keep us as customers!  

I finally got tired of the circular conversation and informed him and Eric (again) that we were leaving.  My sister and my wife, frustrated and unhappy, had already gone to wait in my car.  I again asked Eric for the manager's card.  Eric and Mike left.

Once again, instead of going and getting the manager's card for me, Eric returned empty handed, this time with the sales manager, Anthony, in tow.  

Anthony was pleasant, but I had to try and stay calm as I explained our position on the deal a third time.  Anthony said Mike shouldn't have made promises he couldn't keep and said he'd have a talk with Mike regarding his conduct, but I'm not convinced anything happened after we left.  

Unfortunately, the damage had been done and the four of us left VERY emotional and distraught.  If we had been allowed to leave when the deal first went south, we would simply have been disappointed and this might be a 3-star review.

Simply put, this should have been an exciting and positive interaction, particularly for my sister who was genuinely looking forward to buying a car that day, but it degraded to become the worst dealership interaction we experienced in our search.

If you want to feel appreciated as a customer, I can assure you that there are many dealerships around the valley who make that their priority.  Unfortunately, Horne Kia isn't one of them.

The restaurant is located on the second floor and is much nicer inside than it appears from the outside. Service was attentive and friendly as well. The menu is quite large and I haven't had much Malaysian food.

See my photos for pictures of what we ordered. I enjoyed everything! I always love soup and the Bah Kut Teh here was tasty, though not strong enough (Chinese herb wise) for me. We have a similar dish in Taiwan with the same name (pronounced in Taiwanese, which is a language almost identical to the Hokkien spoken in Malaysia/Singapore), though the Taiwanese version does not have cabbage or tofu and is made with pork ribs.

Then the guy running the joint is like ya well those are cooked medium rare, but I'll cook more for you myself.  Super condescending, I wanted to Google medium rare and shove it in his face.  So they come out, and the inside is almost raw to rare. At this point I'm like whatever, I'd rather have it be undercooked, and  I'm starving.

The staff at Whitney (especially at the circulation desk) are so friendly and helpful. There's also armed security on the premises, so consider this place extra safe.

If you're looking for a quiet place to study, this might be a good place for you. I have personally come here many times to study. It's comfortable and there is Wi-Fi, so you can bring your own laptop/tablet/whatever. It's also super quiet, as a library should be. 

This particular branch is on the smaller side, but there's still a good selection. One of the things that I admire most about LVCCLD in general is the technology. If you don't see the book you're looking for at your home library, you can log into the online system, request the book from another branch, and you can pick it up at your home library. They send you an email when your holds arrive and even send you 3-day notice emails when your books are due. It's a very organized system. You can return books at any branch location. 

Another thing that I admire about LVCCLD is their programs. They have story time and other activities. All upcoming activities are always posted for you to see once you walk through the door. It's a great way to spend a day with the kids that has educational value.

After getting ""The Ultimate"" I was surprised to find that my bagel was cold and barely toasted, while the center was so hot it felt like it was microwaved. Not to mention, that I think the cheese they use is the single slice Kraft cheese that anybody could get from the grocery store.

What this store could use is a good butt whooping or its sure to fail. Fire ALL employees and start over. Hire a store designer and pay them a couple thousand to make customers feel comfortable, and clean out the grease trap or whatever the heck it is that is stinking up your store.

Normally this area of a restaurant does not provide the most stellar of service but our bartender, Chris, was on point. He often checked up on us and made sure to glance over once in a while as well. 

We started off with the wagyu steak tartar. The fat ratio coated our mouths and when paired with the Ermitage M. Chapoutier 1997 it was heaven. Although I was getting full by this stage we continued with their New York Strip, bleu cheese scalloped potatoes, and the creamed corn. I am glad we split because I would have gone into a coma. The steak was melt in your mouth tender. Cooked to a medium and I was not ready to throw in the towel. 

By the time dessert rolled around, I was about to die. The chocolate cake with spiced cherries was decent. It was a concentrated brick of decadence. I am not always a chocolate person, which made this too much for me. The strawberry pavlova was the highlight for me. The chef takes a classic dish normally eaten in Australia and New Zealand and puts his spin on it. I have tried this dessert a few times while traveling abroad and never liked it. It tends to be too sweet. Stripsteak's version was a more mellow presentation. Before presentation a strawberry jus is poured over the fresh fruit. The combination of that with the basil ice cream is magnificent. We had also got the beignets with a McCallan 18 caramel which I didn't care for.

This would be the first time I have been able to eat frequently at a Checkers since I moved to Las Vegas from Georgia 10 years ago.

Unfortunately, there are just too many flaws with this place for me to overlook, and here they are:

(1) The cooks can't tell the difference between sandwiches: I ordered a Big Chicken Deluxe... the only difference between the 'Deluxe' and the regular Big Chicken sandwich is that the deluxe comes with a tomato and cheese. ON 2 OCCASIONS IN A ROW they forgot to add the tomato and cheese. I had to bring it back to the counter and explain it to them. The SAME staff prepared it both times... so apparently they don't learn their lesson nor do they care.

(2) Pricing and menu layout is inaccurate and incredibly confusing. They have a HUGE sign on the OUTSIDE window stating that the ""Big Chicken Deluxe"" is 2-for-$6 yet on the menu (at the top) inside the building, it says it's 2-for-$5 ... I pointed this out to the cashier and she did nothing to get this corrected. So, I ended up paying MORE than what the menu says.

The location can get a bit hot inside on warmer days, and its definitely not a great place for a large group, but with time that may change.

So thanks, Chef Darren and the crew at Downtown Food! You guys are my new favorite.",2013-05-08 22:17:09

We decided to order a little bit of everything to try things out: the Farm Greens salad, a large, lovely variety of greens, herbs, shaved carrots/radishes/cukes with a light balsamic dressing - YUM. The Pasta Pomodoro - a medium sized portion of delicious, housemade pasta with a 100% fresh tomato sauce (fresh from the garden tomatoes!), and the white pizza - which was KILLER. The crust was light and chewy, the ricotta they used was silky smooth - honestly the best white pizza I've ever had. Lastly, we shared a latte which was smooth and creamy with a full bodied foam on top. We LOVED everything about this restaurant. So why only 4 stars? The price. I'm a foodie. And this place was delicious. But $14 for pasta/tomatoes? Ouch. It might serve the owners well to create a lunch menu with lunch menu pricing.",2018-03-23 19:49:15

QoCCkKzpG14w1RRnXhV9Lw,-hietrA8M58asfpyJkCyiA,hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q,5,3,3,3,"Yesterday I decided to be the porker that I really am. I went and ran at the JCC and then met a friend for dinner. After trying to decide where we were going to go I remembered that this place is my go to, even if I sometimes forget to suggest it. I always remember at the last minute but it is never a bad thing. Honestly, this place is great. The food, the ambiance, the staff. Everyone and everything is just top notch. 

We got there around 7PM and the staff greeted us warmly. We were taken to a little table in the back. I should have asked to sit near where they were making the noodles since it was my friends first time being there I would have liked him to be able to watch the noodle magic, but next time for sure. 

We were in the back corner area but that did not distract from the experience. The waitress still came around and asked us how we were doing and was always there to answer questions. I had her go down the list of the dry noodles and boy, was she on it. Also, how do they refill your water glass so fast without you noticing it? It is mind blowing, or maybe I am just not that observant. 

Now, as I get into how much food we actually consumed, just know, I did start this review by saying my inner porker did come out. 

Appetizers:
Golden Tofu Nuggets: These were really good. I will say that they are little medallions covered in some nice panko fried to perfection. The plate was full and we were able to enjoy them. The only thing, if they were smaller they would have been easier to consume and the tofu inside would have been fried a bit better. While it was good, I enjoy the littler sizes so that the tofu tastes less like tofu and more like fried goodness. These were good, but the portion size was a little larger.

Pork Soup Dumplings: These are amazing. Nothing is as good as these pork soup dumplings. While a little hard to eat at first they really are delicious. You just have to pop a little hole in the side, get a little of the soy sauce on them and boom. Amazing party in your mouth. The soup broth is flavorful and not at all salty and the little meatball, yummy!

Rolled Onion Pancakes with Sliced Beef: First-time trying, and it will not be the last. It was like a little beef burrito. It was super good. The fried pancake surrounded the beef mixing into the perfect little sized sandwich. This could have been eaten on its own. Seriously. It was filling and good. I will want to try the veggie version of this the next time I go. 

Entree:
Hot and Spicy Wonton Noodles: Yum. It comes with about four wontons, spicy noodles, and a little bit of broccoli. I think that for the next time I might ask for extra veggies to be added to the dish. The noodles were spicy, they were not lying, but it was not overwhelming. I would say that you can also add meat to the dish but this one did not really need meat since the wonton's were filled. Nummy Nummy in my tummy. 

Ok, it was a great night and I cannot say how much fun I had coming here. The food was great and so was the company. I am happy that I got to show someone another noodle experience and they left raving and saying they are taking their friends here. I think that is a win in my book. Come here, you will not be disappointed.",2017-11-07 14:15:22

This Two Hippies is a a nondescript strip mall with a small sign on 7th ave.  Being that it was the day of the Race For The Cure & business was to be elevated, I would have hoped for them to put out additional signage in order to lead people right to them (like the a-frame sign I saw sitting behind the counter)  but.. you know whatever.

The counter staff was friendly and coffee magically appeared literally within 15 seconds of ordering it. Lots of choices for the breakfast. I got the Waffle combo with crispy hash browns.  Mind you I was bummed when my hash browns came out the opposite of crispy & if you want to get picky they are not hash browns, but instead are breakfast potatoes.  My friend got a breakfast bowl, which to both of our confusions did not come in a bowl?!?  The waffle was pretty good & her toast looked to be a yummy thick cut egg bread.  

I heard many of the complaints about the plastic and styrofoam usage here.  They appear to have heard it too because there is a sign at the register stating that they use some sort of ""earth friendly"" version.  I wasn't entirely put off by the plates, but the cutlery proved to be the enemy to both my friend and I.   The small cut of the potatoes was near impossible to get on the tiny tines of the small plastic fork which (much to my amusement) lead my friend to enter a battle to keep the food on the fork long enough to make it to her mouth.  I quit laughing however when it came time for me to eat my waffle.  My waffle refused to submit easily to the wimpy plastic knife and lame-o fork.  It became a battle of endurance trying to fight the tiny, flimsy cutlery and slippery plastic plate as my waffle flailed around while trying to be cut into bites.

The decor is amusing, for sure enough to keep you entertained for a couple visits.  I couldn't tell if it was the fact I had just done a 3+ mile walk on less than 3 hours of sleep and I was a little loopy, but I believe their intercom system had a voice changer on it which made it sound like that trippy 70's psychedelic movie voice.

I heard good things in line about the stuffed french toast, and apparently their salsa is pretty good. I'll definitely give them another try, there were enough things on the menu that caught my attention & the prices are reasonable.  As we were eating breakfast a group of cops came in to enjoy a meal as well.  That is always a good sign, cops know the city and in turn they know where the good cheap food is. So chances are if you see a large group of cops eating a meal at a particular eatery then it is a place worth checking out.",2010-10-11 00:37:26

Came to get coffee and brunch one day, ordered the tree of life pita and the turkey club, both were amazing!! Fresh ingredients, healthy organic options, flavorful sauces, and beautiful presentation. The ice coffee was very good too, they brew ice coffee with the proper apparatus and the taste is perfect.

My complaint is on one female staff. While we were standing in line ordering we were disagreeing about the drinks option and this staff started to join in and started to reprimand me for my choice and lecturing me. That's extremely inappropriate and not any of her business. Then after we ordered, she was forcing me to write a tip. I'm ordering a togo order, where there's no service involved therefore I do not tip. She gave me an extreme hard time about not leaving a tip and continue to say that I can leave a cash tip. Wow!

We had grand plans to party at Wet Republic during the day, but were defeated by the prospect of traveling to another hotel just to be hot against a different background.  We settled on hitting the pool at the Palazzo, where we were staying.  We decided to check out Azure while we were there, in case we wanted a bit more party with our pool time.

We would've been mad if we'd paid money to get in.  Since we were a group of girls, we got in free, and we were able to scope the place out without paying cover.  What we found was a smaller version of the normal hotel pool, with loud music and more people.  There was no atmosphere - the Palazzo pool is one of the more standard Vegas pools anyway, and the Azure version was maybe even blander.  It was, in other words, worse than the free hotel pool in every possible way.

We ended up spending the afternoon in the Palazzo pool, and the few scattered children didn't bother us at all.  It was a relaxing day, and not too hot despite the rather intense temperatures.

The floor is tile but looks like hardwood and the whole room is done in soothing earth tones. On one wall there are some interesting black and white pictures with captions and then the coffee counter is in the back.  One thing that they make sure to note here is that they only take cards and things like Apple Pay/Samsung pay and they do not accept cash.  For our coffee on this morning my wife and I both decided on getting cappuccinos.  The coffee here ended up being decent but my cappuccino reminded me more of a strong latte than a cappuccino.  By that I mean that it was very milk centric (whole milk based on the taste) and I didn't get too much of the coffee.  What I did get was decent enough and nothing about the drink itself was inherently bad, it just wasn't exactly what I was expecting nor wanted.  It was the same for my wife and she ended up tossing most of her coffee and we got her a different one elsewhere.

The service is friendly, but I don't like that the owner keeps her baby at the restaurant and cries in the back kitchen area.  I get it, she doesn't have daycare, but then stay at home with the baby - her husband is already there and they have a staff that can man the place while she's taking care of her baby properly at home.  An infant or any child does not belong in a restaurant kitchen all day long. 

Moving on to the food - I'm not a vegetarian but the person I frequent this place with, loves their vegetarian spring rolls.  I'm actually pleasantly surprised by how tasty it is.  The rice paper is chewy and the veggies are fresh.

I always order pho but not something on the menu - it's called pho tai gan sach.  Basically pho with rare beef and tripe.  Their pho there is tasty but never enough noodles and way too much broth - I guess they do that on purpose as you can order extra pho noodles for an extra fee.

-I got a great rate on the room
- It has a central strip location

The Bad:
- Self parking has 7 levels, but the elevator only goes to 6. The 7th has a very large deceiving sign with the word elevator on it. 
- Their buffet is the worst I've ever seen at that price point. 
- The carpet is bubbling in the hallways making a super long walk to the room even more difficult with rolling luggage. 
- Staying in the 'Linq view ' rooms is a joke. Only a partial view and loud noise day and night. You can hear the Carnivale bar at Harrah's all night.
- Only 1 device per day is included with The Resort Fee
- The AC constantly reverts to auto. Meaning if you want the fan to run, you have to adjust it every 10 minutes when the system flips from on to Auto on its own. 


The Ugly:
-I cut my toe on broken glass from a previous guest within minutes of arriving in the room. It took an hour for them to send someone. I ended up asking a housekeeper to mop up the blood and potentially more glass. 
- The elevators feel like death traps. No ac in them. Only one worked in the parking garage. They also lack the sensors to stop if someone is still in it.  I have the worst bruise(extremely painful) of my life trying to hold the door after letting people exit before getting on. 
- The rooms with bathrooms that haven't been updated have mold and mildew covering the tiles and grout. 
- Someone vomited in the hallway. It took 2 days to get it cleaned so you could no longer see that person's dinner.

Ugh, I always feel like I'm going to have to throw down $10 for two slices or some other nonsense. I decided to opt out of the pizza and garlic bread sharing (and bill splitting) by ordering an Italian beef sandwich and fries that came with au jus (hence the reason I ordered it) and jardinere for $6.99.  The fries were thick and gave them to a guy at our table and I ate the sandwich. It was filled with a ton of meat, but I wish there had been a bit more aus jus and jardinere. It was really yummy and I'd for sure order it again, subbing onion rings for an extra charge, though. 

Apparently the pizzas and garlic bread (half with cheese, half not) was really good, according to the rest of the group. One of my friends from Jersey also opted out of the pizza sharing and got the $5.65 two slices of cheese pizza and a sprite and she said it was ok.

First off it was nice to have free parking on the strip (Palazzo hotel). The theater was located near the grand luxe cafe so stopped in before the show to enjoy a pastry.  

Seating began at 6:30 and the show started at 7pm. We were seated next to the stage with a runway in front of us. We looked over the drink menu and decided on a couple cocktails. To order the presses the led light on the table. The cocktail waitress quickly came and took our order...The Gilded Sidecar and the Maestro Mule, both drinks were quickly delivered and they didn't skimp on the alcohol. The glasses were small for $15 but we were on the strip watching a free show ;-). 

Without knowing what to expect, save for the stories or shows we had seen about the Moulin Rouge, the Great Gatsby and Romeo and Juliet the show began. From the beginning there were cast members all over the theater, singing and running and dancing. Every seat is probably a good seat in this theater. They sang a mix of songs from classics to current chart toppers. The dancing was exhilarating and the voices on some of the singers was amazing. The dancing and choreography was also a sight to see. 

The story told their way was original and worth seeing. The tickets normally run $86 each but you can get discounts from local discount stores for about $50-65. If you enjoy shows similar to broadway, then come check it out and enjoy for yourself.",2017-08-17 01:50:16

I enjoyed my first visit here about a year ago with a friend. I really liked the concept of the converted service station ( like another favorite of mine: Copper Star ). Yesterday I was riding around on the motorcycle, trying to decide on a coffee spot to read and relax and Sip popped into my head, so I made my way down there. I was a bit apprehensive that it would be too crowded on a Saturday morning around 8:30 ( I typically prefer an earlier start ) but I was really pleased that there was plenty of room to grab a nice table and settle in. 

You order your stuff at the bar area, which looks like a good spot on those upcoming beer night excursions to come. I ordered an Americano and decided on the breakfast burrito to go along with. The staff was friendly and my coffee was made quickly. The folks behind the counter seemed cheerful and efficient. Settling in with my book it was just a short time before my breakfast showed up. As breakfast burritos go, it definitely hit the spot but didn't jump out in any particular area. That said, I'd definitely try it again. Salsa on the side was tasty and had just enough of a kick. The tortilla wrap was nice and tight with just enough crispness. 

Sip has a nice open feeling inside. Tables are of various sizes and spaced far enough apart so you never really feel crowded. There's a spacious outdoor patio area as well, along with some seating out front. The music overhead was not too loud and wasn't overbearing. Overall, I really like the vibe of Sip and I'll be returning again pretty soon. It's definitely worth the trip down from North Phoenix. Recommended.",2018-05-20 15:12:58

We went here last night for a friend's birthday. The place wasn't as packed as the last time I remember. I was surprised to see that there were more girls than guys last night.

The live band they had last night was fun to listen to. Their set had a good mix of old and new. I believe they are named after their lead, Gregg Peterson. Unfortunately, after they stopped playing, the music reverted to a generic blend.

Obviously, the drinks here are overpriced. You just come to expect that from Vegas. You'd have to show up before 8pm for their happy hour to get a better deal on drinks.

When I walked in, I was hit with a strong body odor aroma. Oddly it was only at the entrance. Once I walked inside, the stench was gone. At the hostess desk, I placed my order for two rolls: the Florida and furious dragon rolls. My total for both came to $16 and change. While I waited, I noticed how unkempt they keep the restaurant.

The pizzas do somewhat remind me of Italian pizza, just a crisper crust. They have some very unique pizza flavors at Sauce. Last time I ate there we tried the  Rosemary potato, spinach, feta, and olive pizza. I was a bit hesitant about the potatoes, but it turned out to be really good.

The pesto and havarti brought a lovely creaminess while the salsa and red onions gave a hint of sweetness. I skipped the menu and asked for a cheese croissant and a palmier from the bakery. The croissant was perfect in texture (I should have asked for it to be heated up), and the Palmier was the sweet touch at the end of the meal. 

For those who don't know what a Palmier is, it's like the Asain butterfly cookie but much larger and with more textures.

Pricing is competitive: ranging from $3.50 for a medium - $5 for a large. However, they really messed up the art of milk tea and even the potted plant (plantation) tea; it tastes like dirt and water for real. The tea flavor is nonexistent; I really just tasted water, the crushed Oreos do not enhance the drink, just makes it gritty and taste dirty. Even when sending the drink back for improvement, the drink comes back tasting the same. What in the world?

I popped the egg and let it get all happy in the broth, and picked up a piece of that bacon, omg the bacon is soo good. The broth to me needed something but Clever Koi makes their own sriracha sauce and added that to the broth and BAM! That did the trick! 

For my 1st ramen experience, this was a great bowl of it! Now its left me craving more and can't wait to get back to it!",2014-02-06 16:30:04

My sister wanted me to try their Outlaw bourbon drink - but they had just taken it off the menu. Too bad too. Sounds amazing with smoke and bitters. Happy hour has good drink specials, but a limited bar menu. We enjoyed house chardonnay with an order of unlimited seasoned popcorn, while husband opted for a heartier burger from the bar menu. The burger smelled fantastic and he did say it was good, except for the really thick slice of velveeta on it. Great if you like that sort of thing. Burger comes with fries, on a toasted bun with crispy bacon.

Perhaps I got lucky with the food and service, or they fixed everything by opening weekend?

I tried out Guu North York this past weekend, after hearing they're opening a branch in uptown. I honestly expected the worst looking at some of the initial reviews, but I honestly had just as awesome of an experience compared to Guu Sakabar (haven't been to the original branch yet).As expected, you are greeted with a loud welcome entrance in Japanese by everyone inside. Ahh yes...the Guu experience. If you complain about that, then this place isn't for you. Turn back now cause it will get even louder as time goes on.

Their menu is largely similar to the other branches, but they do have a few exclusives, as well as some opening specials. I ordered the takowasabi, buta bara, wagyu beef tataki, saba oshizushi, kakimayo, gindara, okonomiyaki, ikapiri, and the black sesame creme brulée.

I really enjoyed the takowasabi (ordered 3 of them at the end!!!), buta bara, kakimayo, gindara, and the black sesame creme brulée. The takowasabi had real wasabi stems, so if you're not spice tolerant, do consider skipping it. The buta bara is exclusive to this branch and has an awesome pork belly taste (somewhat similar to Kinton's pork belly). The kakimayo had a thick cheese coating with plenty of mushrooms and kusshi-sized oysters. The gindara had an excellent miso coating and the cod fish itself was smooth. Finally, the black sesame creme brulée tasted like real black sesame, and was the perfect size for my party of 3 to share.

The wagyu beef tataki, saba oshizushi, and okonomiyaki were also decent, and are good choices if you've never tried them before. I've had better elsewhere, but they're still good nonetheless.

The ikapiri wasn't anything special.

Service was excellent the entire way, but you will have to accept the fact employees have specific roles. The person carrying dishes to serve you will not be the person taking down your order; you have to flag someone who's not carrying a tray with food or drinks, as those people are the ones responsible for taking down your order. They tend to be easy to find so it shouldn't be a huge issue.

So despite the initial poor reviews, I honestly believe this place is just as good as the downtown branches! I'll definitely come back if I don't feel like venturing into the city.",2015-06-09 04:07:03

Had a nice waiter who was knowledgeable and friendly.  I had the Michelada, which is like a Bloody Mary with beer.

The food is exactly the same, but the wait is much less which is why I often frequent this location.

Since I'm not very familiar with Chinese food like this I had a ton of questions on exactly what I was ordering. The waitstaff were very helpful and introduced us to some great eats. We ordered Wood Ears & Sliced Tofu kin appetizer which was very tasty and an ample size for two, keep this in mind when ordering that the noodles and dumplings are very large portion sizes so don't order too many appetizers or you will have to bring home food, we did.

As our main dish we tried the Braised Beef Noodle soup and Dan Dan noodles. The Braised Beef Noodles are in a huge bowl of broth with a ton of noodles. I loved the tenderness and subtle flavoring of the beef that was in the soup. The Dan Dan noodles are ""Dry Noodles,"" but don't let that be misleading you still get a hefty bowl of noodles that are coated in a sauce similar to a peanut sauce with a little bit of kick. 

I'm a big fan of Bubble Tea, and fortunately it is offered here and have to say that your options to customize your Tea to what you like are available. I have actually never had been offered so many options for my bubble tea.

On another note I wasn't sure if they offer forks for us lazy folks, but I suggest taking your time through your meal and sticking to using the chopsticks. I have never  used chopsticks for noodles and it was certainly an experience but fun and made our lunch stretch out a little longer than normal.

Situated just outside of Old Town Scottsdale, Scottsdale Stadium offers a great place to watch a game as well as a location that begs you to go out after it is over.

Getting to Scottsdale Stadium can be a bit of a pain.  It is a few miles from the freeway and almost requires that you deal with Scottsdale traffic.  If you take Earll to Civic Center and then merge on to Drinkwater, you should be able to find either street parking or library parking for free.  The dirt lots on the east side of the stadium should be avoided.  Also, the Trolley goes by the stadium so you can park anywhere along the line and catch it.

Once you try to walk into Scottsdale Stadium, you will notice the food bank collection going on at each gate.  This is not voluntary.  You will be required to drop off everything eatable or drinkable (except closed water bottles) before you can enter.  This, of course, should prepare you to empty your wallet once you are inside.

The concrete concourse obstructs the field which is a big hindrance but the area down the foul lines and the entire outfield berm has a clear view from the concourse.  That is where most of the good food is located anyways so you can stay out from behind the concrete monster.  There are plenty of food vendors and usually a nice broad selection of beers & cocktails.  

Seating in Scottsdale is some of the best.  The berm seating has a huge slope and features large shade trees.  This makes for the best grass seating in the Cactus League.  The regular seats are a bit on the smaller side but almost all of them are close to the field and have good views.

The practice field is beyond the right field wall.  Usually, this means the visiting team takes BP on the main field making this a great place for autographs.  If you were to want a Giant to autograph something, they all come down the first base line and most will stop and sign.  Don't expect to have access to the practice field beyond standing behind a chain link fence.

This stadium has hosted so many teams over the years, it is too bad the terrible Giants play there now.  Ignoring that fact, Scottsdale Stadium is a great place to catch a game, especially if you are in the East Valley.",2009-03-05 14:54:11

We had a room on the 5th floor which is one of the closest floors you can have to the main level which I enjoyed because you were able to get down to go out or back up to your room quickly. Our rom had NO view! It was a view of the building next door- literally a wall. We went down to see if we could switch or upgrade to a room with a view of the strip or the pool and they said yes for $30 a night. You really aren't in your room that much in Vegas anyways besides to sleep so we weren't willing to pay. If you are in your room that much that you need a good view you are doing Vegas wrong. Our room also had an adjoining door to the other room which I didn't like and we were in an upgraded room but the bathroom was still not upgraded which I didn't like. 
The show in the hotel was not happening when we left. the show is Donny and Marie which I heard is really good but they were traveling. 
I love that our hotel has the Flamingos and connects right to the LINQ and to Harrahs so if it is bad weather you don't have to go outside. I also really liked that we have two of the best and most popular bars in the Flamingo which is ""Margaritaville"" and ""5 O'Clock Somewhere Bar"" where you can play beer pong.

After FINALLY seeing ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" Kay and I stopped in and had a meal that was stone-solid and done with a flair for the dramatic. 

No, we stayed away from the teppenyaki business since we just wanted some quiet. 

It's strange how I sometimes ""complain"" that sushi usually tastes about the same whenever and wherever I have it, but it's really the best kind of ""same"" you can get. The Osaka rolls were filled with tuna, avocado, and I forget what else (these aren't on the online menu), and had crispy roe atop them. A mayonnaise-based sauce was smeared all over the plate, and I eagerly dragged each meaty, sweet seafood medallion through it, treating each piece like a pastry or piece of protein candy, relishing their oceanic flavors and juxtaposed textures, both soft and crunchy colliding in my mouth. 

Sliced and cooked with amazing precision, the Steak Teriyaki was a gorgeous, glorious medium rare and was served with exquisitely presented fruits and vegetables, including ornately cut oranges. 

The atmosphere was as ""nightclubby"" as expected, but being that this was a late Sunday afternoon, there were more families about, and at least one birthday bash was in full effect.  The service was adequate albeit somewhat cold and aloof for most of our meal, our server loosening up a bit by meal's end. 

No one can stop them now, Saga's on the loose.

And if you ""got"" the above reference, you are a fan of Canadian AOR and prog-rock and have my deepest sympathies for the current cultural landscape is hostile towards thee.

At the end of the day, I appreciate the selection of wines and their neighborhood friendly atmosphere. I refer all of my high end Summerlin clients to Roy's!",2014-01-18 03:45:02

PN2cPlR0x2ONWtNdWNi8Xg,QMZhObocnRnQXHFok-4jWQ,SBtf7ifQA4EB-8E4Lnzn8g,1,3,1,1,"Mulligans, I am disappointed in you.  This has previously been one of my favorite go to spots on the weekend, and I used to think of it as the perfect place to end the night.  However, it has gone downhill over the past few months, and after several horrible customer service experiences I do not think I will be frequenting this establishment again.  Let me be specific....If you mess with my money - and do so consistently and without apology...then I will not return, and I will be sure to tell as many people as I can, regardless of how ""fun"" your bar might be.

A few months ago, I went to Mulligans, and when ordering my drink, I asked them to just leave a tab open and handed them my card.  I ended up ordering one more beer, and then closed my $9 tab at the end of the night.  The next day after checking my bank account, I was astonished to see a $50 hold on my account from Mulligans.  I immediately called them to inform them of the error, but was told, pretty rudely, that it was standard procedure for them to hold $50 for any opened tab, and that it would just ""fall off"" in a few days at my bank...nothing else they could do.   They did tell me that there was a small sign on the bar that mentioned this policy, and that I should have read it first (because that's apparently what people look for or notice when they go to the bar).  Furiously, I waited for 5 business days for the funds to become available again.

A month or so later, I went in again.  Same situation, same low dollar bill, same $50 hold...although this time I just kicked myself for not remembering it the first time.  I did call the manager to ask if there was a way to avoid this other than paying cash (which I never carry), and was told that if I had closed my account after each drink rather than keep an open tab, I would just be charged for the actual dollar amount owed each time.  Good to know (although also a huge pain in the butt).

Flash foward to last week.  I went to Mulligans again, this time for St. Patricks Day.  Based on my previous conversation with the manager, I was confident that if I just closed out my tab each time, I would be fine.  I ordered one beer (specialty for $3 dollars), and closed out.  Later that night I went back and ordered two more beers (total, $6) and closed out.  The next day, I checked my account.....and found that there were TWO holds on my account from Mulligans, for $25 each.

I immediately called again and explained the situation.  The person on the phone immediately started in on their ""policy"" to hold funds when there is an open tab.   I told him that I had been aware of that , and that is why I closed out each time...So why I was being ""held"" $50 for a total of $9 was a mystery to me (and I was seriously regretting the tip at this point).  He stated ""well,  the best I can tell you is to just wait for it to drop off, there's nothing we can do"".  I told him that was not an acceptable solution to me, and he interrupted to say sarcastically ""you really need to take this up with someone else...I'm just the barback"".  So I asked him to take down my phone number and have the manager call me that night.  He took on an incredibly rude and sarcastic tone, and said (overenthusiastically)   ""absolUTELY!!   I would LOVE to do that for you"".  I ignored the tone and gave him my phone number anyway, and again requested that the manager call me that night.  He replied ""ABSOLUTELY"" again in his rediculous tone, and then hung up on me.  I never heard from the manager.

This is incredibly poor customer service, a poor way to handle your customer's money, and a really EASY way to lose business.  By the way, it's 4 days later and the funds are still being held.  This is a recession people, I go places with cheap beer for a reason!  And I can guarantee you there are a million other places to go in Scottsdale that serve $3 beers and don't do it while stealing from your pocketbook (even if it IS supposedly temporary).  I suggest staying away from this place unless you like to have your money taken and you enjoy rudeness.",2011-03-21 20:06:14

Observances, as usual, were postponed to the weekend, but more importantly, I had scored free tickets to see Coheed & Cambria with Between The Buried and Me at Stage AE, and we were hastily en route to said concert. 

Kay insisted on eating Downtown prior to the show and wouldn't settle for somewhere near the North Shore venue. 

I had recalled that a gyro shop was near the Wood Street trolley station, but as The Cosmic Trickster would have it, it was closed for good (an Indian eatery is moving in). 

I'd spotted Tonic before and thought that it might be too swanky for us, but I needed to take a chance, quickly for we were running late! 

Immediately we were seated and served by a genial young gent who understood our dire situation.

""Dude? Coheed & Cambria? Are you kidding? We'll get you guys in and out! What do you want, man? Lay it on me.""

Scanning the menu like an android with laser eyes reading bar codes, we were instantly arrested by the proposition of Tonic's Nachos, Apple Burger, and Fish & Chips (Kay can't pass those up, ever). 

The Nachos were almost Supreme, but failed to reach the peak of the mountain due to the bland, baby food that was the guacamole. However, corn salsa, jalapenos, guacamole, sour cream, and those exactingly fried tortilla chips all had something to say about quality and nearly drowned out the lackluster green paste. This hunger-inducing scene from a Quentin Tarantino-helmed feature was brought to mind...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bN2-6rkeEA

The Apple Burger was focalized on a potent patty that tasted somewhat of smoked pork. My imagination perhaps? Of course, the inclusion of apples, roasted no less, and Applewood smoked bacon only furthered this possible Christmas dinner delusion. The Dutch export known as Gouda cheese, which I suspect wasn't aged long due to its mild flavor, added smooth, creamy texture to this odd burger. Making the mouthfeel all the more engrossing was the crisp bacon and the buttered, internally squishy, externally flaky bun. A lightly sugary maple aioli had me thinking I was eating a delightful and hearty chuck wagon breakfast sandwich (I would have added a fried egg if possible). Yet those apples confused me still...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLuUGDVfheI

I've never had a burger like it before and may never have one like it ever again. Kudos to Tonic for something so risky and unique. 

Also above average were the twice-plunged french fries (excellent crisp on these), the chilly dill pickle shaft, and Kay's flavorful and moist battered whitefish which I sampled a few morsels of. 

We paid our bill, bid our waiter farewell, and headed back onto the trolley, just in time for Stage AE's lights to be snuffed out and for these mindboggling opening chords to begin quaking the arena...

Recently went through a renovation (summer '14) and naturally jacked the prices up on their food.  You'll be looking at a lunch bill around $10 if you want to sample a few Dim Sum offerings and are drinking flat water.  Unfortunately, because of this, the value is rather marginal on their offering - it was a mistake in my book.

That said, however, the food itself is tasty and the experience of Dim Sum is unlike your traditional run-of-the-mill offerings around Charlotte, so it's worth a shot.  I'd definitely recommend the leak dumplings, the sticky pork buns, and plenty of that hot/oil/sauce they keep on the table - I eat that stuff straight.",2014-10-13 14:14:15

But here we are today, and the sake bombers have gone from lower end of the spectrum $5 on happy hour to all of a sudden $8 each without warning.  Really?  Did you think your food and vibe was justifying raising the price that much?  Now you're the most expensive sake bombers around!  

I'm disappointed.  This place isn't good enough to justify that kind of price for a bottle of Kirin and some trash sake.  It isn't enough to justify 8 for two shitty small skewers of chicken when Dozo does it better for cheaper.

So my flight was supposed to leave back to Vegas at 6pm. Then the text came in that my flight was delayed to 9pm. Game Over. My battleship had been sunk. I was stuck. What else do you do when you have 3+ hours to kill at an airport? Eat dinner of course!

I really liked how Sky Harbor has a ton of non-chain restaurants in their main food court area. A quick glance at Yelp and Chelsea's Kitchen with it's great dining room was an easy pick. The menu isn't huge, but definitely has enough options to appease a variety of diners. My selection on this flight-delayed evening was the short rib tacos. It was an easy decision to make once our dynamite waitress gave the suggestion saying it was what they were known for. We also decided to start off with chips & guacomole. I don't know if I was just famished or if it was that good, but the guac was absolutely off the charts good. My tacos were equally as tasty. The short rib was super tender, great flavor, and the homemade corn tortillas made this a 5 star meal. I wasn't crazy about the kale slaw that accompanied it, but I'm also not a big fan of kale. The person I was traveling with landed on the Green Chili burger and it looked really, really good. He housed that, I housed mine, and we were able to kill a good 90 minutes in the restaurant.

It is opening day and I wanted to treat my hubby to this great little shop in the heart of Mt. Lebanon. I met up with Ryan the business owner who told me about some of their plans for the future.

They still carry farm sourced all natural ice creams including our hometown favorite Pittsburgh Pride which is black and gold ice cream with chocolate chips and some cookies in it. Among the new flavors are salted caramel. The fixings bar is still there for $1.75 where you can get unlimited toppings for your cone or dish. Got some of the Pittsburgh pride and I was still able to add on to the rewards card I had saved from last season. This is one of my favorite ice creams they sell. My husband got the French vanilla. He thoroughly enjoyed it.

The chalkboard tables are still there for the kiddies. Take out containers are in their freezer and nearby a water cooler.

So onto what's next. Ryan told me they sell Zeke's coffee from East Liberty by the pound for the same price you would pay if you bought it there. He gave me a list of their blends and if there is a particular one I wanted just call the store and they will bring it over.At this point they are not selling individual cups. In addition, they will soon be acquiring products from Sinful sweets located downtown and it is they want to add to their home delivery service.

For example he mentioned putting together a package from Uptown coffee, Sinful sweets, some their ice cream, and a few other goodies then  deliver it.  I was intrigued by the concept and thought it was a great way to give back to the community. I am anxious to see it get off the ground especially for people who can't make it here for various reasons. It will be a great way for them to sample some of the best the city has to offer and I'll be happy to support them in any  way I can.

They make quality ice cream. The scoops may be small but just enough for me. You can get cups in three sizes or on a cone. Welcome back Betsy's! Located in the heart of Washington Road in the Mt.

The trampoline part was fun, but I really think it would be better to have times for adults and times for kids. It isn't very fun to be bouncing around, while you've got kids flying off the walls, screaming and trying to shove you off into the middle trampolines so they can have the cool side ones. Also, trampolining for an hour starts to get a bit boring and redundant. There are only so many ways you can jump/fall/bounce off the tops and bottoms. We ended up leaving about halfway in.

I've been to a number of valley vegetarian friendly spots with an Asian tilt that I really enjoyed (Vegan House & Veggie Village to name a few), so I was fairly optimistic about this place going in.  So how did my first true in-depth culinary experience in Mesa go?

When I first walked in, I was a little confused by the setup for a number of reasons.  First thing I noticed was that an office desk was right out in the middle of the restaurant and was populated by enough paperwork and equipment such that it really did appear to be the makeshift office for the owners.  There was also a full sized ladder taking up space in between a pair of tables along the wall.  Additionally the menu that the business advertises on their website is actually just one of two menus they have available.  There's a vegan/vegetarian menu that they call their ""American"" menu (although that menu has plenty of Asian classics to choose from), and then there's an entirely separate menu which serves Vietnamese items (both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, though the menu descriptions don't always make that clear).  The additional menu sent me into a little bit of a scramble mode as I suddenly found myself studying over what looked like more than 100 Vietnamese menu item choices in addition to the regular menu.

While the Vietnamese items looked tempting, I decided to stick with the items they originally advertised on their regular menu.  For starters, I went with their King Egg Rolls.  3 egg rolls filled with carrots, taro root, bean thread, tofu, onions, and yellow bean served with sweet and sour sauce.  I'm thinking this was meant to mimic the flavor of king crab.  The filling certainly had the texture of crab, though not quite the flavor.  The dipping sauce was also a little unusual in that it was thinner and milder than most sweet & sour sauces I've had, but pretty decent.  For my entree I settled on the Pad Thai.  Rice noodles with tofu, bean sprouts, green onions, shredded carrots and ground peanuts.  In an unexpected twist they also doused it with peppers (though the menu didn't advertise that fact).  As a result, the Pad Thai was pretty spicy.  Not overwhelmingly so, but enough to where I needed H2O to cool my mouth pretty frequently.  I would've preferred the spice level to be a little more subtle to be honest, and the flavoring in the noodles were a little flat to me.  I liked the tofu chunks and the other veggies, but overall not one of the better Pad Thais I've had.  For dessert I asked for the banana egg rolls with ice cream.  At first, I asked for coconut ice cream with the rolls.  The waiter came back and said they only had mint ice cream.  Okay, let's go with that.  Waiter comes back a minute later and says they don't have any ice cream at all.  Sigh.  Alright just the egg rolls.  The four dessert egg rolls came out piping hot and covered in chocolate sauce.  These were delish, with a good mix of sweet and crunch.  But boy I'll bet these really would've gone nicely with some of that coconut ice cream.  Bummer.

Total cost for the food, tax, and tip came to $27.  I was plenty full from the meal and the service we got was very friendly, though the execution was a bit clumsy.  Between giving me misinformation on the ice cream, to misplacing the Pho spoons for the table, to accidentally bringing a meat Pho to one of our group members (instead of the vegetarian Pho she'd asked for), there's room for improvement on the service side.  I'd give my experience 3 stars, but just barely.  Sorry Mesa, my first deep dive into a local restaurant didn't go quite as I'd hoped.  I've recently put other Mesa restaurants on my Bookmarks list to go explore in the near future, so this won't be my only glance at the city's culinary scene.  But Green Lotus probably won't be on my list of local haunts to revisit anytime soon.",2017-05-26 05:03:31

Popeye's was my absolute favorite (and still is in some respects) but livin' in the south, I gotta give props to Boj's.  

Unfortunately I've put myself on a diet, but I really really do enjoy Bojangles when I do get it - when people from out of town come in.  It's a great excuse to get some good chicken, biscuits, and sides.

This location is off Independence Blvd.  Unfortunately you can't get to it easily when you are traveling East - just make a U-turn and you are good, but getting back out (if you want to continue East) can be a little tricky.

I agree that this is a nice looking, clean place. It would probably be great to watch a game. The country twang was turned up a little high for me but I can't knock them for that. If it was gameday, I'm sure I would be happy.

Our server was new and did a decent job. Never let our beer glasses go empty. However, I must agree with many others regarding said beer glasses: do not use Mason jars, and especially WARM Mason jars to serve your beer! I get that they are trying for a theme of sorts and they are OK for mixed drinks, but the stupid jars don't work for beer. I couldn't even drink my first one for over 10 minutes because of the massive amount of head on the beer from the jar. By the time it calmed down, it was warm. 

On to the food. My friend ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. The chicken was soggy and almost room temp. We think they used sauce straight out of the fridge which cooled the chicken and made it a mess. The bread was barely toasted and got super soggy quickly. I had a burger and asked for it to be medium rare. It was almost raw and was supposed to have avocado on it. It had less than a teaspoon of storebought guacagoo on it. I know because I scraped it off. We pointed this out to our new server and he just laughed. Not funny. Asked for the manager and she never came.

I this dog had great flavors all over including the dog itself which was perfectly cooked and the right amount of heat. The hana was just a stack of messy amazingness that had a real mexican flair. The bacon is the real standout adding the great bacon flavor and a crunch that gives the textures some depth.

The sides were good to. The chili is not some canned stuff and is good. The tater tots are just awesome though and nice crispy outside and that soft pillowy inside you crave.

For those of you who know Noah's Bagels, Einstein's is something like that. They have usually about 16 or 20 different flavored bagels, and serve sandiches, salads, coffees and other beverages. 

They make a good Lox and Bagels, with your choice of bagel. They toast it for you, give you cream cheese and capers, red onions, and slices of tomatoes. I love this from Einsteins. I like it on the Asiago cheese flavored bagels. 

They also have their own ice tea blend, which they call ""Spontenai Tea. It only comes in one size, has a refreshing tea flavor mixed with fruit flavors and ginger. 

They can make most of the specialty coffee drinks that  you find at that place with the little brown mermaid with no bra on.

I've been to Capital Grill and found it overrated.  For great true quality, I always go to Sullivan's.  They have the best Ahi Seared Tuna, Blue Cheese Wedge, Steaks and some phenomenal desserts.  We tend to get the Filets but sometime is go for the Cowboy Bone-In Ribeye.  I highly recommend the Gorgonzola Butter on top of either!  Sometimes they put too much but it's an easy topping to rake off if you prefer small amounts.  Also, the sides... I had the Cream Corn this weekend for the first time and it was crazy good.  I love the Baked Potato with some fresh chopped bacon.  You get so used to the basics with that side... but to have it done right really makes you realize what you have missed in it.  It's fantastic.  Sometimes we can get the Souffle but often get the Brownie.  It's 'souffle like' with it's baking dish and is always moist.  Just remember to save some of that red wine to have with this dessert!  

To those who left 1 Star : I challenge you to actually go and experience Sullivan's for what they are known for.

Lots of topping, even on a one topping order. Light on the sauce, nice thin and crispy crust.

Sad it's not a five star though. I read reviews. Looked at pictures and was excited to try this place.
We ordered a few apps and sushi rolls from the HH menu and it was all just okay. Chicken wings had a great crispiness and there was a delish garlic sauce just on half
The chicken wing. I wish it came with more sauce. Calamari was disappointing. It was just random cut up sticks that were overcooked and dipping sauce was sour.  Husband enjoyed his shrimp tempura roll and bulgogi. The bulgogi was burnt and had that burnt bitter flavor and came out last. I had the 6 piece sashimi special. Fish was cold but the cuts were a joke. They literally took one normal slice of tuna and cut it in half. The salmon was two whole slices and the ""white fish"" ended up being red snapper. At least they were whole slices. 
I also had the jalapeño roll. Which was literally a jalapeño popper in a sushi roll. It was pretty good surprisingly and had the volcano roll. Presentation was cool because they lit it on fire. 
Service was a bit much. The girl we had was the only
One working until just before we left. She constantly
Kept asking if we were ready to order. But when you give me a book of rolls. It's gonna take time for me to read them. Lol.

The Enchiladas de Denis are good, but everything borders dangerously close on being wayyyy too smothered in sauces of one variety or another (or both at the same time). You can kind of lose the rest of the food underneath all the sauce, and in turn, it makes the dishes overwhelmingly rich.  I always leave with a doggy bag (not necessarily a bad thing!) due to the food being so heavy!  Or it could be the massive amounts of chips and salsa I consume before the food arrives.....

I'm a sucker for table-side service....be it a bananas foster, waiter prepared caesar, carved whole duck.  So needless to say, I enjoyed the tableside guacamole.  But there is an operational advantage here too...when avocadoes oxidize, they turn brown and mushy.  Even after adding lime juice, it can still lead to a disappointing guac experience when you get a bowl of brownish green goo.  Good guac is creamy, not gooey!  You get the good guac here.  An overzealous waiter sqeezed some lime right into my eye when we were dining with some friends here on our last visit.  Made for some comedic relief to the dinner convo.

This place is always packed, so don't be surprised if dinner takes a little while to come out.

To be clear, we did not have to pay since it was a fundraiser, but the prices were listed on the menu and I would have been glad to pay them. 

I had the tilapia feast which was grilled tilapia with a Greek side salad and roasted potatoes. It was pretty tasty. A nice change of pace from the typical fast-casual fanfare. My boyfriend got the lamb gyro which came with his choice of a side and chips. He got the cucumber tomato salad which was surprisingly fresh. We split a piece of baklava and it was good, nothing astounding but still tasty. 

They have a selection of wine, and might have beer. I only had water to drink but appreciate having the option to order a glass of wine. 

The feel of the place is open and bright. There are large prints of photos which we found out were photographs the founder had taken on his trips to Greece. I like that added touch of personality.

It had nothing to do with the Tempe 12 calendar babe celebration going on - which, with the titillating (no pun intended) video in the background, was pretty to look at, the pervy sausage fest who were early, or the textbook Old Town Scottsdale drones afraid to take group party photos for Stephy S..

I'm always up for a place like Six when my lady friends want a night on the town. I love slick ultra-lounge spaces like this complete with my favorite Barcelona chairs and a fancy encased aquarium, but it didn't quite deliver for me.  We somehow lucked out with a VIP table because we were super early, I'm sure.

WEAK:  
* I had a few of the French/sweet potato fries the group ordered, and perhaps because I'm used to the fries at Delux, I thought they completely sucked donkey balls. 
* The restrooms are kind of rad.  There are a half dozen private loos with clear glass doors that become opaque when you lock the door.  Apparently those are all unisex until a certain time when they're reserved for women, even when there aren't any around.  At that point all the guys in the joint have to squeeze into one bathroom.  I was chased from going in to one of the bathroom (with no women around) by a bathroom attendant and schooled on the system.  Not cool. 
* Service was great until the billing situation was bungled and left people in our party confused on who was paying what, who was overcharged, etc.

Even though it's not exactly my scene, I would come back on a weeknight (never a weekend).  It's not my cup of tea, but I can appreciate an upscale Scottsdale lounge when I see one....go with the right people and I'm sure you can have a good time, here or anywhere for that matter.

The food.  Sometimes it is really good and sometimes not so good.  I have had their burgers, Mac n cheese, flatbreads, etc and for each one, I have had them in really good versions and some where they were really bad.  I recently went there for brunch and had the breakfast poutine.  Probably the most disappointing meal I have had at this place.  The poutine was made up of tater tots that looked like they can out of a McCains bag, three poached eggs which were OK, one cheese curd...and one tiny piece of bacon.  I don't know what makes this a poutine or worth $14.

Wish I could give this place a better rating based on previous experiences here, but the last brunch left a bad taste in my mouth.",2017-03-15 22:42:56

We arrived without a reservation and were given the option to wait 30 minutes or sit at the community table. We chose the community table. We also paid a little attention to the incoming crowd, but probably saw around 2 whole tables come in after us with a plush amount of open seating getting cold in the dining room. 

The staff was a little scripted. A lot scripted. I felt like I was on a Lord of the Rings ride at Universal Studios or something. Okay, I don't even know if that's a ride. 

I guess if you really don't pay attention to the whole price/ food equation, then you don't realize how much you are getting ripped off. Sure, I love the down home local farm food just as much as the next gal. That's pretty much all I make at home. I was raised in the South. 

But my $9 salad consisted of a few sheaths of bib lettuce, and a sprinkle of other things. I wasn't expecting gold nuggets in the thing, but come on. 

The dinner was so-so. Again, if you take the price out of the equation it was enjoyable to eat. Then reality sinks in when you get the bill and realize you are sitting at a community table surrounded by guys on internet dates with fair that you find at a country diner and a bill that rivals that one you would get at Domminck's.

I wish I could leave a better rating for this restaurant, as I have the feeling that when they get things *right*, they're really right.  

Unfortunately, they got about half of the things we ordered wrong.

Let me start by saying that my plate was pretty delightful.  I tried the sweet chili salmon, which was well-spiced and sauced.  The asian veggies on the side were perfectly cooked and flavored, and the horseradish mashed potatoes had neither too much nor too little horseradish, which is no small feat to properly gage.  They could have been slightly warmer when they came out, and needed a touch more salt, but these are minor quibbles.

The Fiance, alas, did not have as good a dining experience as I did. He ordered a cheeseburger with everything on it but mayo (which he does. not. like).  They brought a burger with nothing BUT mayo.  We couldn't find our waitress to correct the mistake, so finally had to flag down another waiter (who, by the way, acted most appropriately: when we asked if he could find our waitress, he instead asked what we needed.) so we could get some ketchup and mustard delivered on the side.  

Fiance later said the burger, even disregarding the mayo mishap, was very bland and tasted as though the beef had not been seasoned at all.  He would not order it again.

One side comes with the burgers - a fact not mentioned on the menu - so Fiance ordered the collards.  The collards here are made with smoked turkey instead of pork.  They were cooked well, but the flavor was lacking.  Not sure if that was due to the turkey, or just an absence of other seasoning in the pot?

Portions were abundant; I took about half my potatoes and salmon home, along with Fiance's leftover collards. We were both too full but wanted to try the famed banana pudding, so got an order to go.

Much later that night, we dug into the pudding.  Loved the marshmallow creme on top, but was most dismayed to find absolutely  zero vanilla wafers in the whole of the dish.  Since they're touted as being homemade and thus amazing, I was most looking forward to sampling that part of the dish.  Apparently, on this night, it was not to be.

I have heard that Savor is a better deal, $-wise, for lunch, so we may give them another try if we happen to be in that part of town for a midday meal, but I'm afraid Fiance was too disappointed to want to try dinner again.  A shame, since I do think that, under different circumstances, we might have had a much better experience.",2011-10-28 22:52:48

 GOOD REVIEW - After at least two visits

 NOT SO GOOD REVIEW - After one visit. Why would I go back?

I am NOT often led astray by New Time ""Best Of"" so I keep a record of the ones I want to visit and this little Restaurant, having received ""Best Chinese"" was one of those on my list.
The recommended (by New Times) dishes were the Hot and Sour Soup with Lamb Dumplings and the Braised Chicken and Potatoes.

A friend and I ordered the Hot and Sour Soup with Lamb Dumplings' and fortunately, we decided to wait before ordering anything else.

 The Soup - greasy might be an apt description and it was almost like spooning pure Balsamic Vinegar. Nothing much in the soup except a few green onions and the dumplings.

 The Dumplings - texture was unusual, almost slimy, while the filling, when eaten separately from the dumpling skins was flavorful.

Candidly, it was hard to get through this course and we decided to try a significantly better Chinese Restaurant (Chou's Kitchen - never disappoints) right across Alma School, that should have won the award by far!

Also important to note was the price. $10.95 for a large bowl, $6.95 without Dumplings, OVERPRICED to say the least!

A couple guys suggested Flipp'n Burger.  Without question, I headed straight over with my gym gear on.  Flipp'n burger is located in the heart of Kensington - it was a Thursday night around 7:30PM and parking could easily be found on the streets.  I quickly glanced at the menu board and decided to go with the signature flippin' n burger to go.  I sat and waited so I was able to browse the interior a bit.  It seemed a little retro looking and small with a few tables at the front and seating near the window.  There was also seating outside but it was too cold for that.  I noticed there was a lot of glass bottle sodas and a freezer full of popsicles near the counter where you pay. 

After a few minutes, I was called to choose my toppings and that's when I noticed that the burger I had ordered came with two beef patties! Haha, I guess that's what happens when you quickly glance and order.  Any who, there are the general toppings you can choose from as well as a handful of sauces.  I got everything but the jalapenos and olives.  My burger came with cheddar & swiss cheese, 'crispy' onions, sautéed mushrooms, beef bacon and flipp'n sauce....Boy, my burger was flipp'n huge! 
 
When I got home, I couldn't wait to dig into my flipp'n burger.  When I took it out of the paper bag, it kind of fell apart, which was sad because it wasn't wrapped properly but I did not fear as I knew it was all going to the same place, my belly :)  I ate with a fork and knife and I found the bun to be too bready and a waste of calories.  The pattie itself was seasoned well and juicy but slightly on the dry side, and my onions weren't crispy (must have been the drive home) but the beef bacon was delicious!!

So when the rep walked in the cafe to get something, I told my husband that he should ask him if the store was opening soon. As luck would have it, he said he'd be glad to help, in a few minutes. So, when we finished our lunch, we headed over. 

The office smelled so good- it was tropical plug-in. Anyway, the small but nicely situated store is square shaped, and the six or seven padded chairs are along the wall of the entrance. Steve, the one we saw at the cafe, was eager to help out my husband with his Blackberry- the battery was a little wonky. So he tested it, and it was perfect. So he applied the updates, and said if there was anything else, he could do for him, to stop by. He was very nice. The other rep was nice too. The visit lasted a few minutes, but it made a lasting impression. Customer service is the number 1 priority here.

The location is kind of hidden, since it's in a strip mall (where most of the stores are closed, on the other side), next to Metro PCS and Sally Beauty Supply Store, facing Pecos. We just happened to be in the area, getting lunch. But otherwise, I wouldn't have known it was there.",2011-08-25 22:10:11

I think the menu is ever-changing, but on this particular day, I had a spaghetti with meat sauce, which I quite enjoyed.  My husband however, ordered a pizza, and it was TEENSY TINY.  It was maybe 8"" in diameter, and while he did love the taste, it wasn't really a practical serving size.  Luckily, he had ordered a soup as a starter - however that was served just barely warm.   We watched the table beside us order it later in the evening, and saw that it was delivered steaming hot.  So perhaps we should have spoken up.   However, it was rare that a server visited our table.  We felt like we were often forgotten about.

My husband wanted red wine with his pizza, but we were told they didn't yet have red wine (they hadn't received the shipment).  They had rosé, but that wasn't going to cut it.  We couldn't help but wonder why they wouldn't have just bought a few cases at the local LCBO?   I don't understand how restaurant liquor licences work, but there must have been an option?  

We then ordered dessert (some sort of cake, I can't remember now what it was), and I, being pregnant, thought a decaf latte might have been nice with it.  But, we were told the decaf coffee hadn't come in yet.  Again.... wondering why they couldn't improvise by running up to Starbucks and buying a few pounds of decaf?  

The atmosphere was cozy and comfortable, with a real ""at home"" feel to it.  Lots of kids, very family-friendly.  But the service is a definite area for improvement.  Food seems to be hit and miss so far.   And our receipt was hand-written.  So like I said, maybe we just went to early.

ptic7PqebZxOY7YdmGC_rg,OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,YidWQ-CipHgGpA8jygsPpQ,2,3,2,1,"I have two tanks - a 5 gallon tank for a beta and a 20 gallon tank for two goldfish. 

When I moved to this side of town, I noticed that my goldfish had lost a substantial amount of scales. I waited a few weeks to make sure it wasn't a growth spurt, fighting or injury during transportation that they lost their scales. I was worried that it could possibly be a bacterial infection and headed over here for some medicine and a background for their tank.

I asked one of the sales people to point me in the direction of the medicine. Instead I got a lecture about how I should totally just wait it out because their tanks have tons of scales from their fish at times. Here's the thing. I don't have 300 small fish in a 15-20 gallon tank that are susceptible to overcrowding, fighting and damage from fish constantly being scooped out. I have two 6 inch goldfish in a proper sized tank that they never leave. My situation is different. I never was shown where the medicine was.

I also wanted a tropical tank background for my larger tank. The same sales girl told me I should really just go with the black background instead because it's so superior and how the other backgrounds are cheesy. I didn't ask for a personal opinion. If they're the same price, give me what I asked for. Instead she cut off the black background roll and told me if I didn't like it, I could return it. Agh! Every time I look at the tank, I'm upset with the background because it looks weird. 

On another occasion I had to buy a replacement 18"" 15 watt bulb for my tank. They had two in stock that were $9.99. I got home and put it in. Nothing. I could hear something knocking around inside as if the filament was already broken. Agh! I took it back and asked to open the only other bulb they had in stock before I purchased it. It was also broken. I got a refund and went to PetCo. 

This location has a large selection for aquatics, but I cant give this place a higher rating because their sales staff doesn't understand that it's my money so skip the lectures if it is not an animal safety issue, and give me what I'm asking for.",2013-12-09 18:51:44

We started with the Butchers Platter comprised of the chef's favorite cheeses and meats. A true charcuterie with this AMAZING house mustard! Aged White cheddar, goat Brie, truffle crescenza, prosciutto, hot coppa, salumi and all the fixin's like cherry marmalade, pistachios, olives... we. Ate. It. All. 
Not sure about the oysters ( after all he's a butcher not a seaman ) we ordered two. Then two more and then another two just to be sure. The jalapeño mignonette was zesty and the perfect concomitant, a simultaneous explosion of flavor when eaten with the oysters. 
Our little had the kids cheeseburger and he demolished it! Usually the fries are the first to go with him but not here, he was all about that burger.

But lately, the quality has been going down constantly..!!
Last time I visited this location was last year sometime in the summer, and I was very disappointed then.
So today, I decided to give it another chance, since I love the 'original Moxie's', but things are still not that good unfortunately.

They have revamped the menu majorly, keeping some of their main/top seller items, while modifying/adding new items..
Presentation has changed also, they now use aluminium trays for nachos for example rather than the original setup, or clay rectangle and oval plates for appetizers.
We ordered three appetizers and all three were too greasy..
As for our mains, we had the lettuce burger, chipotle chicken, caesar salad with chicken, steak salad and pasta. Needless to say, all plates were dry and missing flavour.

On the other hand, moxie's used to have (in my opinion) the best service at a chain restaurant, hands down!
This has hit rock bottom now, the service today was below average, slow and just like the food...tasteless!

Basic ticket price is $37.50 per person (everyone over 12 yrs). Is it worth it? a reluctant yea.. there are a lot of inter-active games and displays. I bought tickets 4-5 weeks ago, and was so excited that it was opening here, just a mile away! If the tickets were a little cheaper I would go again, but now it's off my bucket list, i'm not going back. A lot of work and thought went into this event, nicely done and great staff. Bring a jacket, it's cold throughout. Bring the kids, it's more for them. I was told it was targeted to the adults, but that was lack-lustered for my tastes. First room they have you stand in front of a green screen for a picture, but give you no input on how or what it is for, they need to put samples of the three backdrop pictures up front so you can have a small idea of the finish product. They have cafe food on-site, which we didn't try, there is a lot to take in, you can spent a quite of a bit of time just reading everything. Yes there are restrooms inside (outside) available. My biggest disappointment is that I was expecting props from the Marvel movies, and backdrops, more museum type pieces, there was none. The simulators that held my interest were the 'Holo-Blaster Training Simulator' and the 'Black Widow Agility Maze'. There was an 'Avengers Encounter' that would not work at all for me, maybe because I was wearing dark clothes and black jacket, so the computer had a hard time in seeing my movements, not sure. At times it just seemed 'hokey', good-hearted but hokey, and you reflect on the money you spent to walk through. The Marvel Experience collects a LOT of information about you, and get ready to input your email address in their interactive displays everywhere. I own a couple restaurants and maybe I should start charging a $10 per car fee since you're already spending money at my place?

How do I know? After 5 years, and having taken numerous classes, I went here to take the class to renew my Nevada State CCW License. 

I have taken several classes here in Las Vegas, Arizona, and Texas. This was by far the best organized and most comprehensive. The instructor, Geza, was most comprehensive. He was not a ""Commando"" or a ""lecturing Law Enforcement Official"".  He was very knowledgeable about the laws, as well as giving tactical instruction. He teaches you that just because you have earned the privilege to carry a concealed weapon, does not mean you are a member of Hawaii Five-0.

I improved my knowledge and understanding. It was time well spent.  

A couple of good things to know:

They provide you with sufficient ammo to qualify on the Range. The Indoor Range is well ventilated, and most importantly, the Range Instructors are professional and polite. 

Though I did not price out any fire arms, I was very impressed with their selection.

They were the best value for a CCW Class (new or renewal). 

The staff was courteous, professional, and most importantly, not a group of ""stuck up"" commandos.

When we first walked in the door, the place was almost deserted. There were only one other table (4 people) beside. When we left, we noticed only one more group came in after us and basically they were the only one there after we left. This is depressing for a late Friday night dinner joint.

Once we started eating the food, we realized why the place was almost empty. There weren't a lot of choices in term of food when compared with Sura.

mqsnOyFSVEZzcuYG0zOD3A,8teQ4Zc9jpl_ffaPJUn6Ew,DIUK7_PjGCOMcpS2fBiALg,3,8,1,1,"Authenticity.  This is one element I always look for when I review an establishment.  Whether it is a 5 star restaurant or a divey hole in the wall, I look for whether or not they stay true to what they are.  When I look at Avenue, it lacks this critical element.
Now don't get me wrong, I wasn't a fan of the ""old"" Avenue either.  It looked worn and weathered.
The new rendition tries to emulate a mid century modern feel but it falls short. The fixtures, tables, chairs and other furnishings just don't do it for me.  They lack originality and more importantly, history.  The charm of supper clubs and other restaurants of the like is that they have that history, they have that authenticity.  They may be awkward or clumsy looking.  But the fact that-at one time-to some people, it was the ""in"" thing makes it appealing.
Picking some products out of an Ikea like restaurant catalog doesn't do it for me.
Aesthetics aside, I felt the food choices were acceptable.  The waitress recommended the calamari and her recommendation was on point.  The rings and tentacles were perfectly battered and fried.  For my entree, I opted for the cheeseburger.  The bun was maybe a little too much for the ingredients between it but it was solid.  As like many other Food Fight restaurants, the food never blows you away yet never disappoints.

While the food is incredibly tasty and there are some unique flavour combinations, there is just no way a wrap and small juice should cost $21. JUST a wrap, no fries or side of any sort. It just seems completely ludicrous and unnecessary.

Also, I care about the environment as much as the next guy, but I think quality should override concern for biodegradability when it comes to takeaway containers. The new recycled cornmeal (or whatever it is) containers that Fresh has started using for takeaway can't even hold up to the wimpiest of meals. They buckle at the mere weight of the average sandwich, the snaps don't close properly, and you can forget about transporting a hot soup or chili with any semblance of safety or preservation - the lid flies right off and the wimpy material biodegrades as you attempt to eat the food that's inside it.

_2VIoUzOR3KCoI5hU4ZWHA,NsegE9Mqm3GCQeSx0v0tYw,brOiN5kDWJGS9jz1VlBAWg,4,2,0,2,"Back when I was an undergrad at Arizona State, I took some classes at MCC as to avoid further blemishing my school record at ASU. I had this perception as many others have had that taking certain courses at a junior college level would be somewhat easier than that of a university, namely math and science type courses. I was clearly mistaken and earned a new respect for math courses taught at MCC. 

One fall semester apart from my 15 credits at ASU, I also took two additional courses at MCC, a Calculus I class and a technical writing course. I was blessed to be in a Calc. I course taught by a Prof. Santini who began the class with... ""are you guys ready to get on the Santini roller coaster of fun?!?"" upon hearing that I knew it would be an interesting semester. To say the least, it was more than interesting, although I barely passed, this guy knew his calculus, he had the passion and he instilled his teaching in that he wanted his students to understand the foundation of calculus, so, for him the basic formulas were meant to be second nature to us. His class wasn't easy, it was one of the most difficult undergrad courses I've taken but at the same time it was the most rewarding. The same went for my technical writing course in which my professor graded our papers to the nth degree. I have to admit that MCC has instructors that are great in what they teach and prepare their students to be competitive at the university level, well, that was my experience.

I do admit that this is one of the more crowded and busy junior colleges since it serves as a feeder school to Arizona State plus many of its students, like myself were concurrently enrolled at ASU and MCC. Another lesson learned from MCC was my parking skills. I learned how to be hawkish looking for parking. Since my classes were mainly on the side of campus facing dobson rd, my parking options were limited especially since from mcc i only had 45 mins to drive to ASU, look for parking there and get to class. Even now when I have to go to MCC for something, I still get frustrated looking for parking. 

Overall, MCC offers quality courses taught by pretty good instructors, and I recommend supplementing your schedule by taking courses at MCC if you're already at ASU because whatever your final grade is at MCC you can transfer the grade for credit towards your degree without hurting your cumalitive gpa at ASU.",2010-03-17 11:20:20

Went back this last weekend, and was underwhelmed.  The staff was friendly, helpful, and on-point, which was very much noticed and appreciated.  But the food itself seemed to really lack.

I had the Jamaican Curry bowl, which is the last item on the vegetarian menu.  It tasted overspiced; not too spicy, but just as if someone had put in three times the spices the dish called for.  I can't imagine the chef who made this tasted it and liked it.

My girlfriend got the salmon, which was a really good-sized portion, but it could probably have been fresher.  We split an appetizer that was pretty good, and each had one drink.

The music was great, actually.  There's a wall of speakers above the front row of tables, but it's turned to a background volume, which led to the music being clear, well balanced, and unobtrusive.  The decor was good, and I especially liked the custom trussing of lights over the bar.

Lots of parking and a really great environment with live music. We weren't in the main dining room, but we were in the room with the live music and beachy feel which was great. I enjoyed the atmosphere. 

Our server took a while to come by, she might have been on break or something. By the time she came, we had already looked over the menu and knew what we wanted to order. Our food came out quickly after we placed our order.

Lobster and shrimp quesadilla: unfortunately it was our least favorite dish. I didn't get to taste much lobster and I felt it was lacking some flavor or spice.

Coconut shrimp: their most popular appetizer but it wasn't crispy enough for me. It was pretty good but I was hoping for a stronger coconut flavor. My sister loved this dish. 

Seared ahi tuna: 5/5!!! I could eat an entire plate (or 2) but unfortunately I had to share. The ahi tuna tasted fresh and the salad went very well with it. The mango glaze wasn't over powering either. 

Habanero chicken wings: we probably should have ordered the Jamaican jerk wings. While the portion was really big, we did not enjoy the wings. It was spicy but the BBQ and habanero didn't mix very well IMO. 

I had been wanting a frozen bahamarita all day and it did not disappoint me. I'm pretty sensitive to alcohol and yes... I'm one of THOSE people who get super red after half a shot but I managed to finish my entire drink without getting tomato red. Drinks here seem to be watered down because I also tried my sisters classic margarita and it didn't taste like it had any alcohol in it! I loved it but she did not.

Peppermint Cafe goes for a simple decor scheme, with fairly nice table cloth over older dark wood.  It's not shi-shi by any means, but the trappings clean and effective; not distracting, garish, or ostentatious in any way.  They are merely a trifle bland.

The menu is a bit more complex the family style Thai -- but cooked mildly.  The spice balance is also a tad bland for my taste; and I'm not sure whether this is an accomodation to the clientele, or whether a stylistic choice by the chef.

I'll probably visit here again, since it will be near to where I live.  At the same time, I'm a bit worried about setting my standards too high.

Roughly the same distance from my house as the Queensway Cineplex, I'd have to say that I prefer the latter all things considered, but of course it comes down to show times and the availability of the movie I want in non-3D. 

Parking isn't fantastic but a step above Queensway...if you drive around long enough or are willing to walk a bit. The lobby is undergoing what seems to be constant renovations but it's minimally intrusive and if I were to guess, I'd say that it looks a little better than it used to. The theatres themselves are fine and pretty much on par with the other options in the area (it is a virtual monopoly, in case you weren't aware). There's no VIP lounge or bar as there is in the Queensway but the overpriced concessions are also pretty much the same as the other Cineplex locations, other than the fact that this one does have one of those cool Coca-Cola Freestyle machines, albeit with one big asterisk: it actually says ""sorry no refills"" right on the thing! Really. I don't think I've seen that elsewhere. A small popcorn and a medium drink is already twelve bucks and you're begrudging us a refill? Seriously Cineplex?

So it is what it is. We have virtually no competition when it comes to cinema going in this country and if you want to see movie out, you're probably headed to a Cineplex location nearest you. I wonder if the slow consolidation of Canada's movie theatres has any correlation with my decreasing attendance? Just a thought.",2015-05-27 16:18:00

Ambience: Modern, but with a rustic feel. Liked the candelabrum on some of the tables. It's two levels and you can book large parties upstairs. There's a bar area with a fair number of screens to watch sport games. I really like the music there. The DJ plays 90s throwback, which is awesome in my books! The main washrooms are upstairs and there is one accessibility washroom  on the main floor. Reservations are easy to make online through open table. 

Service: I had pretty good service both times. The first time, the service was slower, but we were there at a busier time. Servers are knowledgable and tells you what the specialties are without you asking. If you are sharing pasta, they split it up in two bowls, which I always like! Very detailed oriented. B+ to A

Food: scaddabush is known for their fresh mozzarella cheese, pasta, and meat balls. 

Today, we tried:

Prosciutto mozzarella - the combo together with bread, fig jam, and mozzarella was pretty good. The mozzarella was very fresh and chewy. I found the mozzarella pretty tasteless on its own, but mozzarella normally does not have a lot of taste. B

Capri pasta: seafood tomato pasta. The mussels are fresh and there's a lot of seafood in the dish. the pasta is super fresh. The only issue was the pasta did not have much taste. The tomato sauce was watered down. Not too impressed, but pasta itself was great. I would buy it to cook at home. B

Primavera pizza: the pizza dough is very tender and soft. However, I found the pizza a bit tasteless. I don't like olives, but the Olives gave the pizza flavour, which was good. B 

Mojito drink: it was ok. A bit too sour for my liking, but the drink has orange it in so it's supposed to be sour.

Overall, i wouldn't say the food had a lot of flavour, but it is definitely fresh. Overall grade: B",2016-01-31 05:02:49

Yes, as shown in other reviews, the portions are very small, the cup itself is very small, and even a full cup contains less than a medium DQ cone, for a MUCH higher price. 
Listen, I get it that they obviously need a high margin to keep a one-trick-pony store like this afloat, hire staff, pay the rent, but $7 for a banana and a handful of berries?
Still, IF the product was mind-blowingly good, then I could excuse the price, pay the extra, and enjoy the occasional yummy treat.
Sadly, the product is just okay.

I am an omnivore, but I cannot tell you how excited my vegan friend was that this place was right across the street from where I live, she could not wait to come visit and try the vegan softserve.
Between the two of us we purchased 2 double flavour cups so we could enjoy 4 different flavours and share, but sadly, even she had to admit that everything tasted fine, but only ""just fine"". The basic banana was the best, pistachio was disappointing, chocolate was bland and boring. Overall, unimpressed.

 Overall, I thought that the appetizers were well-priced and portioned, but somewhat limited to spring rolls and fried things.  They had some soups that I would have liked to try, but most of them are only available in servings for two, which is a pity.  Entrees were ok, but there were issues with the spice level (somehow a one-star mango curry was hotter than a three-star garlic shrimp), and my dish (the shrimp) was a bit heavier on the broccoli than I would have liked.

Service was good and generally fit the casual atmosphere. There were a few small issues (water glasses were refilled all night, but the water itself was room temperature; the table next to us got their entrees right after their soup had been served), but our waiter turned out to be a very nice guy.

One big pet peeve: they won't split checks under $50 and will only split checks over $50 once.  That really annoyed the hell out of me, and I ended up getting into a stupid spat with the waiter during which I was more than a bit of a jerk.

Went here and apparently they had the entire place rented out for a wedding party or something, which is already idiotic. Who rents the entire restaurant?  It's not like they didn't have other tables or space, they just had a sign on the door saying the place was booked until 8.  As we are reading the sign, some lady comes running out and tells us we can't eat until 8 (it's 715) like we were carrying plague if we entered the building.

So I go online to book something and everything is unavailable online all night.  So I call, and they tell me 845, even though they just told me that we could eat at 8 at the door.  Also, clearly at 730 I could see that the parties inside were not going anywhere by 8...were they supposed to just magically vanish?  

I could have waited 30 minutes and demanded to be seated at 8 like I was told at first, but who wants to fight to give a place your money?  Also, I sure hope that wedding party was local and will all be coming back regularly because I sure won't be.  

Also from reading other reviews, it appears the managing of reservations and professionalism can be an issue here.  No thanks.  Nothing I hate more than working to hand you my money.  You aren't a caterer, so renting out your entire place part of the night is absurd, even more so when you could accommodate more people.  If you are just full from normal reservations, that's one thing.  How about posting on your website you booked the whole place tonight?  

If you don't have the staff, then get rid of the other empty tables.  In addition, get your staff on the same page... actually you know what? Don't bother. I don't care. Won't be back.

Me & Yvonne T. went here for the Winterlicious menu.


For appetizers: ""Pâté Brûlée"" & ""Mini Haute Poutine"".  

The Pâté  was excellent in flavour & texture, however, not enough crostinis were provided as there were lots of the chicken liver left after the the last crostini was eaten.

The Poutine, fries were prepared in duck lard so I was expecting crisp robust fries, the duck toppings were not as flavorful as I remembered a duck confit to be. The dish portions were lacking, duck was not the best & the fries were soggy.


25 minutes passed after we finished our appetizers before our mains came to the table.


For mains:""Lamb Shank"" & ""Mac et Fromage""

Lamb Shank was tender, however it came out cold & there was no juice or sauce which could have easily made the dish significantly better.  The scalloped taters were soft & had no flavor. The dish could have very easily been better.

Mac et Fromage was good, nice flavor & the cheese's texture was enjoyable. I would not have minded if there was a little more of it to go around.


For dessert: ""Eton Mess"" & ""Triple Layer Brownie Cake""

The brownie in the brownie cake was not really brownie at all, more like supermarket cake. The Eton mess was interesting, like a lump of macaron at the bottom of some whipped cream like substance.

I drove past it on a Saturday morning, and there was a line out the door. I ended up needing to kill some time in the area before any of the Butler Street shops were open, so I hopped in line, figuring people wouldn't wait a half hour for pastries unless they were damn good.

I got a small sampling: A piece of flan, a macaron or two, a fruit tart. But the standout item was by far the almond croissant, which the owner recommended and said was one of the best sellers. It's just melt-in-your-mouth good. It paired perfectly with a cup of coffee.

The owner was also nice enough to have me try a few little samples of sugared bread and pastries despite how busy the store was, since I told her it was my first time there.

Don't let a long line deter you. The pastries here are definitely worth the wait.",2014-10-28 19:17:45

It's not really a place that you can just chill at for a long time unless you can stand on your feet for long periods of time, or you really enjoy being in a crowd. 

Food and drink wise, nothing that stands out, but nothing sucks.  I would go with one of the namesake martinis and peruse around the outdoor seating area.

I thought it'd be light, but I was wrong. Even their so called appetizers will have you full from the richness they entail! I'm surprised that on a Tuesday night, it'd be so crowded, but the place felt alive and fun.

The Scallops with Risotto came with 3 large heavily seasoned scallops on top of a mixed risotto. This was in the appetizer section, but it was a good lunch size portion I would say. 

The mac and cheese and crispy potato chips as part of the ""bread crumb""ish topping. I'm a sucker for truffled mac and cheese, so this was the first victim to be obliterated. No prisoners here. I will be ordering this every single time I return.

The pulled pork appetizer was more than enough for us to split 3 ways. It came with hard boiled eggs and some vegetables covered in a sauce that looked like Ponzu sauce, but was not actually Ponzu sauce, but whatever it was. Absolutely delicious!

Lastly, being a meat-a-tarian, I rarely order salads, but the hype about the Stetson Salad has solid ground. I don't know what exactly makes it so special, but like the menu description said, I would (probably) make a picture of this chopped salad part of my screen saver, because it's heroic how good it is!

I also bought some of their gourmet popcorn on the way out the door. I couldn't turn down chocolate hazelnut pretzel popcorn or chocolate bacon popcorn. I mean, ""When do you ever come across these types of snacks?"" My only dislike was that my diet soda was $4. I was actually taken aback by that since I'm used to sodas being half that, but whatever, I'm one to talk.

Ok it's not a big secret, but it's not readily found either.

Nguyen Huong is famous for making Banh Mi,  Vietnamese sub sandwiches. They currently have 5 stores in the GTA and distribute their assorted subs to the various T&T groceries. 

This location is a full fledged store offering the whole shebang from meals to go, snacks, desserts, deli, all packaged to take home.

Layout, it's small but has the essentials. A long order/pickup counter on right and a refrigerated area on the left. 

There is no seating available so keep that mind. It's purely a takeout establishment.

I looked over the menu and went with the old reliable no.1 cold cut sandwich made spicy"" at a tune of $2!  Hello! that's pretty cheap. 

I tell you nothing beats getting a Banh Mi fresh!  She asked me how many I wanted, I answered just one. Suppose at this price, you can buy a few for later?

Inside the sandwich you get: 

Pickled cucumber
Cilantro
Carrots
Assorted Cold cuts
Jalapeno pepper ahh mouth is still on fire!! Hot
Spread of liver pate

They have other sandwiches available like the lemon grass sausage, chicken, meatball, bbq pork/chicken. Nothing is priced more than $3

I love coming on Saturday mornings with my family.  We grab breakfast at Leone Cafe, let the kids exert some energy on the playground, then visit our favorite vendors  to purchase delicious fruits and veggies for the week.  I bought some delicious asparagus, cauliflower, and garlic from the Gilcrease Orchard. ""Herbs by Diane"" was there with a vast selection and I purchased a bag of sage and apple mint.  I also bought a jar of honey and a handful of honey sticks of different flavors. (I can't wait to brew a cup of apple mint tea and sweeten it with honey).  

In addition to the produce vendors, there are also craft vendors.  None of them are really my cup of tea, but it is always fun to walk around and peruse. There is also a flower vendor and he had a nice selection of cut flowers.  I was surprised to also see a vendor selling Vietnamese food.  The line was really long, so I'll have to check it out another time.  There are crafts and face painting for the kids.

Seemed like a solid start for this little coffee stop set within a golf club.

Did I mention that this breakfast joint is set within the GrayHawk Golf Club in North Scottsdale? Yeah. DEFINITELY not my usual speed, but worth a try considering all the other variables (related to convenience) mentioned above.

Let's just start by saying that I feel very out of place at a high-brow golf club. I was skeptical walking through the front door, but was immediately met by the smiling faces of three pretty young ladies who seemed genuinely happy to be awake.

They were quick to take my order and make small conversation and I was instantly put at ease. I placed an order for an Americano (with extra shots, no cream) and a Breakfast Burrito with Jenn (the manager), then I found myself a seat while Gabby prepared my drink.

The interior of Mojo Morning Joint is bright and clean with plenty of seating both inside and out. The outdoor seating is also very clean and covered with plenty of natural shade (read: trees). The overall atmosphere is calming.

The Americano arrived and was just ok. Not bad, but not great. I didn't expect it to be, though - this isn't your local hipster coffee roaster in the guts of downtown Phoenix, it's a golf club. My drink cost me $3.50 +tax. About on par with other options in this area.

The food, on the other hand, cost me just shy of $10 and I was very disappointed by the portion size when it arrived. I was further disappointed upon taking my first few bites. It just wasn't that good. At all. Not even the salsa! And I can get behind MOST salsas...  :-/

So: mid-to-costly prices, mediocre coffee, small portioning, and not-great food. Why the four stars? And would I come back? The answer is: the girls. And: likely.

Mojo gets four stars because it has employed genuinely bright and personable young women who make the experience well worth the trip. They made me feel welcome, comfortable, and appreciated. I'd come back just for that, and this kind of service deserves a couple extra stars.

Thank you, Jenn and Gabby and other-girl-who's-name-I-didn't-get, for serving me and for being so bright and kind and positive even during the earlier hours of your day. It was noticed, and appreciated, and I'll likely be back to see you again soon.  :)",2015-09-24 15:42:56

For those looking for a temporary break from the glitz and glamor of Las Vegas, the Red Rock Canyon is situated 20-miles west of The Strip. The easy 30-minute drive is extremely manageable to one's schedule and itinerary. Red Rock Canyon provided us a convenient opportunity to experience the essence of Nevada i.e. desert, sandstone cliffs, etc.

There are 16 hiking trails to choose from ranging from a distance of 1.5 miles to 6 miles with different difficulty levels from easy to strenuous. Some of the shorter trails connect with the others.

Another option is the 13-mile scenic drive that brings vehicles and bikes through the mountainous region of Red Rock Canyon. The scenic drive goes in one direction so vehicles do not have to worry about whether they are going in the right (or wrong) direction. The highlight of the scenic drive for us were the first two stops where we saw different parts of Calico Hills. The deep red rocks were amazing in their own right. As part of its natural formation process, some of the rocks were a mixture of red and brown and this contrast in color drew to attention the beauty of the formation.

Red Rock Canyon feels like it is a world away from The Strip because of it's stark contrast in view but all it takes is about a convenient 30-minute drive.",2011-07-31 14:41:35

""I hate that Guy Fieri.  What a jerk.  First of all, he pronounces his last name all Italian, and I am 100% certain that he pronounced it like a full on american all his life until he made it on Food Network.  Then, he gets to drive around and taste greasy food all day.  Plus, he looks high as a kite sometimes on air, which probably makes the food even better.  Anywhere from 1-4 reasons to be jealous/annoyed with the guy, depending on who you are.""

Also:
""I wish God would smite Beyonce.  Her songs are the most annoying songs I've ever heard.  If there were a way for her to get smacked into permanent silence, I'd be all for it.""

And:
""I can't wait to eat at this place.  Street tacos sound delish.  Where is it?  Wait--this looks like a residential neighborhood.  Where the hell am I?""

Ultimately I find the place and go in.  There's some floozy outside with a huge rack--only pertinent because she ended up being an employee.  Well I guess it isn't really pertinent then, either.

Anyway, I'm *wanting* to like this place.  I long to be able to say that I went to a place today and ate food that tasted like pureed happiness.  I want to give this place five stars and brag right and left that this is the place to be.

But I don't.  The service was good--the girl was nice (bc of an earlier review I was expecting the worst) and she told me the street tacos were the way to go.  I got the three tacos, one chicken, one carnitas, one steak (asada).  Plus rice and beans.  On corn tortillas.  And I got a sexy-looking bottle of coke.

When the food came out, I was devastated.  Where my three tacos should have been, I had three walniut-sized excuses for tacos.  Where my beans covered in mexican cheese should have been, I got beans covered in an afterthought of some white cheese (which isn't what I wanted.  Sue me).  Where my rice should have been there was rice.  1 for 3.

The street tacos all tasted ostensibly the same.  That punk Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on Food Network made it sound like I'd wet myself with glee upon eating the carnitas, and the lady making the batch acted like they'd be good enough to keep part of the recipe a secret.  They aren't.  That recipe should be open source for sure, so that maybe someone can come along and improve it.  I certainly could.

Anyway--maybe it was because he was high as a f*&^ing kite but the food did not taste like magic, it tasted like hot sauce.  And I am all for hot sauce--I'll bitchslap a habanero or two, no problem.  But the issue is that whatever I ate, it tasted like only the hot sauce.  I added green sauce--still the same flavor.  I wanted to be wowed, but instead I thought, ""Meh.  I've experienced better.""  Which is why you see two stars here.

In fact, I don't blame Los Taquitos for doing what they do.  Whatever is fine by me.  But now I kinda wanna slew-foot Guy Fieri just that little bit more for telling me that this place was so good.  If you're gonna tell the world what's delicious, don't smoke out first, because I've been there and eaten a piece of my cat's litter and it tasted pretty decent to me at the time.  Hardly a reliable indicator of a culinary masterpiece.

A couple of disclaimers: I don't hate Guy, I have no idea if he smokes out, I'm not judging him or you, stoner.  But I am judging that very average set of tacos.",2009-08-09 03:15:34

nnf4dfWH8iSZShEP4__uKg,JeERFBZyECRwzscG3dvKQQ,wjLgM9Ybe5shoUPRrGMmsQ,4,1,0,0,"Coca Cafe is definitely a go-to for a great brunch in Pittsburgh.  The ingredients are always fresh, dishes imaginative, and staff can always keep their clientele comfortable during their busier times.

A few tips before you go:
1. You should always expect a wait time of at least 20 minutes.  
It's a pretty buzzing place.  Once you arrive, you get to add your name to waitlist. Since it's a BYOB, I typically head up the hill to Arsenal Cider house (about a 6-8 minute walk) to grab something to have with brunch.  If you're lucky they even call you a little sooner.
2.  Try to get there early.
Because everything is fresh, more popular dishes run out towards the end of their open-hours.

Whatever you order, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.  
My boyfriend loves the corned beef has dish (which has been sold out a few times that we went).  I think the smoked salmon omelette is pretty good too.  In our most recent visit, I tried out their lunch menu.  I ordered a mushroom soup and a grilled cheese with 4 cheeses, tomato, and caramelized shallots.  The sandwich itself is pretty large since it's on sourdough, but as far as taste I was surprised by how average it was.  The soup however blew me away.  The mushroom soup was cream based, but not too creamy and filled with fresh mushroom pieces.

For the price, quality, and portions.  Coca Cafe is a definite win for the Lawrenceville area.",2016-03-07 15:55:05

I just had to write another review because this past Saturday, I hosted my son's 1st communion brunch here.  I chose Deagan's because it's really nice family friendly environment, the brunch menu sounded awesome and the prices were ok and that's in addition to my previous wonderful experience here.  

Setting a reservation was no problem and they allowed me to bring my son's cake.  My party and I arrived for our 11:30am reservation and were seated immediately.  Our waitress greeted us right away, took our food orders and answered questions we had about some of the dishes.  My husband and his parents were excited about the Bloody mary bar.  There is a buffet of ingredients to make your own custom drink and it was a hit!  I had the pineapple mimosa - delicious! Then the food came out... my father in law and a friend rdered the chicken fried steak and it was a sizable portion (I wish I took pictures) - well worth the cost of the dish and it was beautifully presented.  He kept raving about how good it was and how he could barely finish the plate because it was so much food!  He said, ""I'm curious to see what the dinner menu looks like if the brunch menu is this good!""

I had the PBLT (pork belly) which was delicious although it came with a runny egg when it was advertised as a fried egg, but not that big of a deal for me.  The pork belly was cooked perfectly, moist and Deagan's has the best home fries I've ever tasted - it's not what I am use to at all - the potatoes were crisp and slightly chunky unlike common home fries which are more ""shredded"" like and only crisp on the very top layer.  My husband had the lobster dish and loved it and my mother in law had the frittata and commented on how good it was.  My son had apple pancakes but didn't like the caramel sauce but our waitress was very understanding and got him another stack of pancakes.  Everyone was more than satisfied with their food and kept saying how nice the restaurant was.  It wasn't busy at all for a Saturday brunch hour.

I also want to say the service was excellent! Our waitress (I can't remember her name unfortunately with everything going on) came to check on us frequently and offered to place my son's cake in their cooler until we were ready for it.  When it was time, she brought out extra plates, forks and napkins as well as a cutting knife.  We all felt more than welcome.  I am so glad my family had a good time.

I hate planning events lol but Deagan's made it so easy (they even called me the day before to confirm the reservation details).  I would definitely host another event here.  Thank you to the staff!",2017-05-01 00:53:48

My first impression was that it was spacious and everyone was super friendly, I mean they open the door for you and are ready with recommendations. I immediately decided on the pick 2 combo, for the price it seemed like a bargain. The Asian BBQ sandwich sounded amazing and I heard the roasted cauliflower soup was fantastic, so I ordered it up. I love that you can see all of the ingredients, everything is so fresh and colorful, it really adds to the experience. We were pushed expeditiously through the line and found a table despite it being packed. I really enjoyed the Asian BBQ sandwich, it definitely had a kick to it but it had a good fresh flavor too. I instantly fell in love with the cauliflower soup, it was so creamy and rich, mmmmmm perfection! I like that they give you a piece of bread to dip in the soup, but it was overkill with my sandwich. I loved ending my meal with a chocolate covered strawberry, such a simple touch but a great way to end any meal. 

I was so impressed that I decided to go back that weekend with my husband. This time I tried the pulled pork sandwich and of course the cauliflower soup again. The pulled pork had honey mustard and cabbage on it. I don't normally enjoy honey mustard, but I thought all of the flavors worked well together. My husband had the clam chowder and the Italian sandwich. The clam chowder had a lot of black pepper in it, which wasn't my favorite, but he enjoyed it. The Italian sandwich, on the other hand, was great and I really enjoyed their homemade balsamic dressing.

Overall, I think this is a really great lunch option. Everything is fresh and made to order. The customer service is fantastic, in fact when my husband and I were there they were giving away their daily customer service award to one of their team members - how cool! I can't wait to try some more soups and maybe even a salad next time. This is definitely a welcome addition to the Henderson scene.",2013-05-08 04:02:04

But the food actually surprised me here. 

Got the old world salad which was filled with all kinds of goodies like feta cheese, olives, red onioin, peppercinis, roasted peppers, cucumber, etc. I think the best part of the salad was their tomato house dressing which is phenomenal. It has a tangy balsamic taste to it which is awesome with any salad I would imagine. Maybe even dip ur pizza in it.

It has really gotten run-down, but on the upside we got to experience a couple of restaurants in this immediate area that we may not have tried in the past when staying at our more posh hotels.

Rx Boiler Room was born from Rick Moonen, a Vegas legend and CIA graduate who created the much hyped RM Seafood at Mandalay.  With him behind this place, we had to give it a try.

It was late at night and we just wanted to sit at the bar and have a drink and maybe an appetizer or two.  We ordered the ""Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets"" based on reviews.  Although it's a great idea, we found they lacked overall seasoning.  A little more salt and they would have been perfect.

We also ordered the ""Bacon Wrapped Bacon-N-Egg"" which is a mind-blowing treat.  Just get it!  It not only looked amazing but tasted amazing.  I could eat this stuff all day.

Normally I would deduct a star for the seasoning on the first appetizer, but what truly elevated this place to 5-star status was one particular bartender:  Corbin.  Our initial female bartender (sorry, can't remember her name) had a very lackluster demeanor.

We would have normally just had one drink and left, but once Corbin (who looks and reminds me of the actor Chris Pratt from Guardians of the Galaxy) replaced her we were treated to a well, ""tour-de-force"" of enthusiasm and dedication to the craft.  He made the best Old Fashioned I had ever had and also gave me a couple of free sips of other bourbons.  His knowledge and love of whiskey and their accoutrements (bitters, etc) was fantastic and sheer  entertainment.  All other bartenders should take a class from him.

Next time we are in Vegas we'll make a pit-stop to Rx Boiler Room to try more food and definitely more drink ;)",2017-04-08 17:11:17

The 60-day-aged steak tartare with truffle oil may possibly be the best steak tartare I've ever had (disclaimer: I don't have steak tartare more than a few times a year).  The texture was perfect, neither too chewy nor too mushy.  The truffle-oil was clearly detectable.  Overall, it tasted light and fresh.

The bone marrow with oxtail marmelade was also awesome.  A great balance of sweet and savory.  Also, a great balance of textures.  Warm, rich and satisfying.

Rabbit and rapini in a citrus sauce was good.  After my other two appetizers, the lean rabbit together with green vegetables in a citrus sauce seemed a little on the healthy side.  The rabbit may have been a little dry, or my senses may have been biased by the previous dishes.

Spaghetti all'amatriciana: springy al dente, good, nothing to write home about.

Butternut squash agnolotti with brussels sprouts and sage: better.  The butternut squash filling was perhaps a touch too sweet, but texture and everything else was great.

Cannoli: no complaints, served with candied orange (or a very dry orange jam?). 

I'm giving them five stars on account of their consistency: every time I've been here, there have been one or two dishes that have wowed  me (though I think my most recent visit was the most wow-ing), and nothing has ever disappointed.

The staffs there were extremely helpful and friendly. They told us that it started as throwing axes to targets at backyard (hence the name BACKYARD), then it became bigger and bigger til they ran out of space at the backyard so the founders decided to rent spaces and made it as the company. 

They taught us how to throw axes properly and even played games with it. Each stations have its own coach that will monitor you and give pointers to improve your throws.

Everything from the shrimp to the herbs at this place has tasted uber-fresh, and the service hasn't seemed any slower to me than I'd expect at a restaurant.  Maybe some people are confused because the prices are so cheap.

FvHZnkzwmUXlrWee5-UUZA,aDYNz8cujkDdmbiOh95ANA,06graki4XxJJJp5b8H9aGg,3,0,0,0,"Just went back for my second visit - I would say this place really rates 3.5 stars but not quite a 4.    The first visit was during the week  at lunch time and today's visit was Saturday at around 10:50.  On both visits, our wait time was under 10 minutes.  (However, we once tried to go once on a Sunday and the line was out the door so we didn't even try to get in.) 

The place is open, sunny and cheery with a sort of country-kitchen  decor. The service has been so-so on both of my visits, but not terrible.  But no matter, the food  was good.  Today I had blueberry-banana whole wheat pancakes with scrambled eggs. The dish also comes with 2 pieces of thick-cut smokehouse bacon.  However since I don't eat pork, I asked for the chicken apple sausage in lieu of the bacon.  The pancakes had good flavor and texture. (The syrup was decent, but they really should serve pure maple without charging extra for it.)  The scrambled eggs were tasty with a nice texture and the sausage had nice flavor and textrure as well. 

David ordered the potato pancakes with scrambled egg whites and pork sausage.  He thought the potato-pancakes were pretty good but he prefers applesauce rather than the diced apples (just a personal preference on his part).   The coffee is decent - not the best in the world, and not the worst.  We do like the fact that they bring a carafe to your table so you don't have to wait for refills. (This is a big deal for me & David - we need our coffee!) 

The only thing that almost ruined today's experience for me was the fact that after our orders were put in, our server came over and told me that there would be a charge for substituting the chicken sausage for the bacon.  I said that was fine.  But he didn't explain what he really meant is that I would be charged for the plate (including the bacon) plus charged for a side order of chicken sausage (despite the fact that I did not get  bacon - If I had known that, I would have just kept the bacon on my plate - to give to David - and ordered a side of Chicken Sausage).  

Now, don't get me wrong,  I have no problem paying an ""upcharge"" when the item I want to substitute costs MORE than the item that comes on the plate... but when the item I wanted costs LESS than the item that I asking to leave off, I think it is silly for the restaurant to charge more.  (Plus, it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth and makes me think twice about whether I want to go back or not.) 

In the case of the bacon here- (which I did NOT want ) - a side order costs $3.95 while a side of the chicken sausage costs $3.50.  We did complain at the checkout and said that we were willing to pay a ""upcharge""  but we did not think it was fair to simply be charged for a side order of chicken sausage when we didn't also get the bacon.  So, the hostess/manager quickly took care of it  and took the extra charge off our bill. I thanked her for taking care of it, but I have to say the restaurant needs to rethink their policy because a lot of people may have just walked away angry. 

The prices were pretty standard  for breakfast places that we frequent  (between $26 - $28 for 2 before tip).",2011-05-28 16:57:28

The waiting area by the door is quite small though.  The restaurant is large but they keep the lighting quite dark which gives in an intimate feeling.  To be truthful, it's so dark I'm not sure what the decor really looks like as I've only been for dinner.

With the restaurant so busy, the service is still good.  The wait staff manages to come by your table often to refill water and is eager to make recommendations if you ask.

The ambiance was cozy and with a feeling of home. It is an environment I would like to spend time with friends and family. But this is not all! Food and drinks are very good too.

My husband and I along with our friends, another couple, were greeted and seated at a six-top. Knowing that modern restaurants sometimes do the communal seating thing, I took a second look at the table and wondered if we would be getting two strangers sitting down later (which we didn't want). The hostess disdainfully asked if something was wrong; I asked if we were going to be joined by a two-person party later. She rolled her eyes and said no, and walked away. Kind of rude, but our waiter was fine and I was there for the food anyway.

The food we ordered was overall amazing, especially the much-discussed burrata with grapes and the salted caramel pudding. The latter was served, upon request, in four small cups so we could split the portion. Spaghetti all'Amatriciana was also really memorable; it had a nicely rounded yet garlicky bite and was one of the best pasta dishes I've had recently. We had a bottle of wine, four appetizers, two mains, and two desserts, which was plenty for four people. Came to around $250, which seemed reasonable.

The food was great, but there was one happening of note, and my review wouldn't be complete without it... 

At the next table over, two women were seated some time after we began our seating. One of the women placed her jacket on her chair and went to the restroom. A moment later, we smelled something burning. When my female friend and I looked around, we quickly saw the source - it was the woman's jacket, which she had accidentally placed on her tableside candle! The flames had consumed most of the sleeve, and the fire was growing quite rapidly. Somehow her companion failed to notice it, and my friend and I immediately grabbed our own water glasses and doused the flames. In such a small restaurant, everyone -- patrons, waitstaff, bartenders -- noticed the commotion. 

Amazingly, the women didn't thank my friend and I (or even acknowledge it, like, hey, thanks for putting out that fire I started!), but what actually kind of peeved me was that our waiter gave us a casual ""thanks"" and then rushed two complimentary flutes of champagne to the women. I believe the manager also apologized to them as well. But we weren't sent over any shots, drinks, desserts, apps, or anything at all from the restaurant. In fact, we then had to wait about five minutes for the waiter to refill our water glasses. I understand giving the women the champagne to brighten their evening and soothe their annoyance, but I was surprised that we weren't sent anything by the manager or even properly thanked.",2012-04-29 23:23:33

We had a nice suite with a livingroom, kitchenette and bedroon with 2 beds. The couch pulled out to another bed. The room had a beautiful view of Mellon Park.

The lobby of the hotel is kind of odd. Instead of the first floor it is on the 25th floor. The building shares space with offices and other places. I believe the hotel is the 2nd half of the building (beginning 12th floor maybe) Security is strict and you need your room key to even push your floor number (except for the 25th floor lobby of course)

This hotel also includes breakfast. It has your basic breakfast of potatoes, meat, scrambled eggs, pancakes, cereal ect. There is also a line for made to order food such as eggs Benedict. My group was hungover and decided to just get a quick breakfast rather than waiting in line for made to order.

The breakfast was very very disappointing. Eggs were horrible and tasted like those pre made eggs you microwaves. Potatoes looked good but had no flavor they were cold and had no crisp to them. The only thing good was the French toast which had hints of cinnamon in it. This hotel is gigantic and only offered a small area for all guests to get juice and coffee.

All of it great information, so I plan on going back on a weekend. I went for a simple Strawberry fields smoothie. It was HEAVENLY. Thick, creamy & you could taste the agave honey :D

I also asked for Hummus. It was very good. You could taste the lemon & garlic :) It came with cucumber slices, baby carrots, pita bread & celery sticks. It was all packaged in a to go brown box. I was worried that on my drive the hummus would somehow leak from the box because it was scooped straight into the box, no liner. All of my worrying was for not!

I ordered the Chicken Gyoza and I enjoyed it very much! I then opted for the Spicy Tuna and California rolls. I judge sushi by the quality of the ingredients and how tight the rolls are made. Better sushi chefs make tighter rolls; that's a fact.

I did not opt to drink as I was out by myself, so alcohol really is not an option (too much to lose). I sat on the outdoor patio with the brilliant green chairs. It was very comfortable and the misters took the edge off of the Arizona late evening heat.

There was a T.V. out there to watch the NBA finals and the crew promptly opted to put it on for me. The service here was great! They checked back on me often. They made it a point to see that both my tea and water were constantly refilled.

The inside is very hip and the visual sushi bar sits far to the west side of the establishment. The music and vibe here is enticing and the draw of Scottsdale locals is a show within itself. It amazes me the things I see these women wear. I saw one gal with heels so tall that she could hardly walk; not to smart if you are drinking but good to look at and a story for your friends.

It is located in a great spot not far from a wide array of many other venues depending on what you have in store for the night. It is crazy but my entire bill came out to $16.50 including my drink. Great Happy Hour pricing! Check this place out for sure! They open up around 4pm daily.

Because I remember the good old days - a HUGE store in Thornhill, with a TON of products from Korea.

This place was barely a memory of the old place (for me).  

Reasons:

Staples, like ""boricha"" (barley tea) in a bottle?  Opsayo (unavailable).
Food court, if you are having a ttukbegae - its ok.  Don't go for anything else.  You'll be disappointed.

Store is clean - no issues there.

the other thing about this place is its balcony which is great when you dont want to be moshing in the mosh pit down below, but just want to dance with your head lets say.  it has a bar up there too - easier to get to then the bars that lie on either side of the stage.  actually, theres a bar at the back bottom too.

Indoor seating is tight so come early. Food and drink are reasonably priced. The tacos are street style sized portions for $3 or $4 a piece. The carne asada can be enjoyed without adding any further spice. The blackened tilapia tasted like ... tilapia. (The non-flavored fish of the world.)

Beer runs anywhere from $3 to $5 on a normal day.
Happy Hour is Monday 11AM-6PM and Tuesday-Friday from 3PM-6PM. Draft beers are a buck off.

I dinged a star for two reasons. Service was hard to come by for some reason. Perhaps they slow down service during a show to avoid distracting the performers? Or they would like folks to drink two beverages only? The other terrible situation is the number of bathrooms. On the restaurant side there is only a single occupant woman's bathroom.

We didn't try anything else on the menu, but everything going by looked tasty.  The only reason for one fewer star than I would normally give is the parking situation.  It's bad, particularly if you come earlier than 6 pm.  Valet parking/the regular lot was full, so I was directed to park on the residential street behind the restaurant.  There were already about 30 cars parked on the street, and let's just say it's clear the neighbors are hostile about having their once- quiet street turned into a parking lot.  There are garbage cans along the curbs with signs that make it clear that they don't want you parking in front of their houses, and frankly, I don't blame them.  When I parked and got out, one of the homeowners confronted me verbally (while holding a hose and spraying water).  Again, I'm symphathetic.  I wouldn't want a bunch of people driving through my quiet neighborhood, but I also didn't want the smack talk I got after parking.

The location is right off a busy highway but, once you turn into the resort, that kind of fades away.  The rooms are all part of separate two story buildings surrounding the center of the resort.  Many of the rooms have balconies that overlook the center of things which includes a lagoon type area, nice pool with hot tub, fire pit and comfortable looking chaise lounges to relax in.  Lots of natural flora around to enjoy and there seemed to be tons of staff walking around and all were very friendly with warm greetings.

The room I was in felt a bit dated but was OK overall with that hipster Kimpton hotel feel to it which I enjoy.  Bad planning in the bathroom relative to how the door and toilet are situated and, my shower dripped the entire stay which necessitated closing the bathroom door at night.  I had room service my first night which consisted of a Caesar salad and a burger.  The salad was average but at least had anchovies which I always like and the burger was properly cooked but no mayo, mustard or ketchup was brought with the meal.

This Greek restaurant is facing the street so it's really hard to miss. There is parking in the back or at the front along the street. The inside looks really cozy, without any windows and tall bar chairs. 

The crowd is seemingly majority of locals &25% repeat loyal customers. It was my date's 7th time here. I had been here before to celebrate a friend finishing her med exams. For the life of me, I couldn't recall the place. So, to my surprise it was the same place. 

The staff are down to earth and very friendly. I noticed all the servers are male. The place has a casual feel to it. Nothing is fancy. Needless to say, It's the perfect place for a hearty lunch/dinner date. 

The patio here is a bit of a tight squeeze but lovely none-the less. When you enter the restaurant, turn left. It's a long way down with the tables all on the left side of the fence. The last booth/table has cushions on the seats. Mostly because it's against the wall. 

The portions are extremely filling and they start you with bread (white AND multigrain) , butter & balsamic vinegar oil right away. The oil is really good quality. 

Order: 
Melikithia - Bruschetta style mix with pita bread. The mix is fresh and light containing eggplant, tomatoes and garlic. 

Kotopoulu Lemenato : 2 large chicken breasts covered in a garlic,creamy alfredo-like sauce with Greek potatoes, pilaf rice and Greek salad. - The chicken was delicious. potatoes were amazing! Everything was perfectly grilled and succulent with the lemon sauce all over. The rice was soft and cooked well. It had long grains in between which made it even more appetizing. 

Kotopoulu Gemisto : Stuffed chicken with spinach, basil,red peppers and goat cheese. This dish was served with side veggies and dry spinach leaves. It was fantastic! 

I cannot speak highly enough of the food here. Want to impress a girl? -one that loves food? - BRING HER HERE!!

 Paid & walked away a desert happy girl - without any desert!  
MAGICAL SUCCESS!!

XOXO

There's something about this location that makes me feel so relaxed. I like how they have bar tables/stools near the front of the store to make use of the space and sunlight. There are also a few high tables and some round tables as you walk further into the store. Definitely a spacious starbucks, but I can see how busy it can get during peak hours and/or weekends. 

When I got there today, I was served by 2 kind baristas. They both had a smile on their faces and were friendly. I liked that they were also very flexible with my orders even when I had to change it midway.

Our wait was about a half an hour so we sat at the bar until our table was ready.  The service at the bar was very speedy; we each had 2 drinks served to us and our tab closed out just in time for our table.  When we were seated, we immediately had waters brought to us and our appetizer order taken. We ordered the cheese curds and we loved them!! I was hesitant that they might be really heavily fried and make me feel kind of gross, but they were surprisingly light and the sauce that came with them was excellent (it reminded me of a tangy honey mustard almost). 

For our entrees, I ordered the eggplant lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the Thanksgiving sandwich.  My lasagna was perfect! I was worried that it might be soggy, but it was very crispy! My boyfriend actually ended up with a turkey burger, and we aren't sure if it was maybe the way he ordered it that threw them off or if they just brought him the wrong meal. We did not bother even mentioning it though, and he still really enjoyed his burger.  I definitely give their menu credit for being so creative (both with dishes and names of the dishes).

Unfortunately when I got to the soup pick-up line, I was told the pot was empty and there would be a short wait. Later I was told they ran out of it completely. The lady dishing out the soup was really nice though and managed well about a half dozen others in the same situation. I ended up going for the Spicy Veggie Chili. It was really good and I would order it again.

When I ordered I was told the soup came with a choice of a side: crackers, cornbread or rustic Italian bread. I chose the Italian bread expecting some hard crusted nearly baguette style bread, but I was underwhelmed by a slice of bread in a zip-lock baggie. 

I also got a turkey sandwich which was basic, but fine. It came with lettuce and a tomato and a pickle on the side. There was a choice of either mayo or mustard and also a choice of white, multi-grain or rye bread. The sandwich could be ordered either half or whole or as a wrap as well.

I ate in, so was given a number to take to my table so someone could bring my sandwich to me. Regardless though you have to queue to collect your soup. They don't bring soup to you even if you are dining in I guess. 

The guy that brought my food was nice. The lady dishing out the soup was really friendly. Unfortunately the lady taking my order was having a bad day and let it show.

Came on a weekend, around 2pm and there was absolutely no wait.  Usually, there seems to be a line-up on peak times like Friday/Saturday lunch and dinner times.

We ordered a Moretti, Zucca Salad (pumpkin), Mediterranean, & Tiramisu.  Both salad and pizza were ok, the crust wasn't crispy.  I've had better pizza elsewhere.  If you share it between 2 ppl, price is not bad.  Otherwise it's a bit big to have on your own.

We settled into the bar area, just us initially although the rest of the space was bustling. The high vaulted ceilings give the place a dramatic feel as do the oversized renaissance-esque paintings looming over the bar in the background. It's a cool, dimly lit space. 
My husband ordered the Barrel aged wise guy - rum based cocktail, pre mixed. It smelled smokey and the run was fragrant but not overly syrupy. He next opted for the manhattan. He was happy. Nothing earth shattering but good. 
I had a White sangria which was mild and lightly flavorful. It had diced apples and a few small pieces of strawberry. Not super sweet as many American versions are. I wasn't in love with it so I ordered a red sangria instead for my next beverage. Overall in Toronto, I found the wine seriously lacking which is why I ditched my standard pour to try the sangria. Again with the red it was very mild, not incredibly sweet and the taste of the wine was minimal. It was just OK. Better than the white but not stellar. I think I was missing more of the fruit flavors typically accompanying sangria. After the sangria the bartender offered me a sampling of a Tempranillo for $15 Canadian that'd caught my eye. Par for the course it was young & almost tart. I passed but this was a common experience with every wine I ordered in Toronto so I don't hold it against them. 

The interior is Beautiful and set back from the main strip. A kind, attentive female bartender who seemed interested in her cocktail crafting took care of us and the entire restaurant. She was a busy woman but handled it well. 
I loved their menu & wish we'd eaten here instead. The menu was heavy with Spanish tapas listings to include many dishes featuring manchego cheese. 
We ordered the bacon wrapped dates and they were exquisite. Everything you'd imagine from the name. The sweet, warm texture of the date complimented by the crisp bacon and warm, creamy manchego. The salty, pork flavor from the bacon paired perfectly with the sweet flesh of the date. To top it off it was drizzled in authentic maple syrup. Part appetizer, part dessert. All parts phenomenal. 
I seriously enjoyed them so much I thought about ordering a second helping. I didn't & instead ordered the almonds which were a small portion given the price and were underwhelming. I'd skip those and probably get the olives next time.",2017-08-29 02:17:51

The slots and video poker games are great.  Everything is new and in great working order--no old clunkers or second hand games here.  There's also more than enough slots and video machines to meet the attendance demands.  The attendants are also great and very helpful.  My only complaint is that servers bringing drinks to slot players requires cash--they cannot take credit cards.  5/5 Stars for the slots.

The table games are actually plentiful given the size of the casino and the attendance levels (65 tables in all).   I've never had a problem getting a spot for any of the games.  There can be waits, on occasion, but nothing major to where you simply can't get in to play on a given day.  The dealers are all really great, too.  The casino did a great job training their folks to be knowledgeable, courteous, and exciting when the time calls for it.  What kills me are the reports that people haven't been tipping the dealers--if you win anything, tip your dealer at the end of the hand/play!!  I noticed some folks complaining that the buy in for a hand in some games is too high at $25.  Minimum bets vary depending on the time of day.  During the peak hours, $25 is fair and limits the playing to more serious people.  During the off hours, you can get a much lower buy-in.  But I don't think I would suggest playing a table game if the buy in of $25 seems too high--these games can get intense and the pot can grow quickly--you need to have more than just the buy in to play the games.  Even if you plan to play a $5, if $25 is all you have, get ready to lose that real quickly.  Gambling isn't a good idea if you don't have a good wad of cash to play for a decent amount of time, IMO.  The tables get 5/5.

The  poker rooms are something that I can't rate--it's just not my scene.  I've had a few friends play the poker rooms and they said the experience was great.  The rooms look to be quite popular and well run.

I think the bar is the biggest downfall of the casino--there's just really no good drink options.  The selection is just way too limited for the price and it's disappointing.  I can't go in there and enjoy a good Bourbon or Scotch while I play some games since they only have two whiskey options.  I'm not expecting to find 60 taps of beers and every vodka known to man, but I wouldn't mind being able to have even a few decent options from the bottom, middle, and top tier of alcohols.  With that said, the service is fine.  I give the service staff 5/5 with the alcohol scene a 2/5.

The buffet is good for a buffet, but I'm not a buffet fan.  As far as buffets go, looks good, has a ton of options, and it's not an arm and a leg.  It sometimes smells a little too institutional for me down there, but that's my only complaint.  The staff in the buffet are friendly and welcoming.  I'll give it a 4/5 since the staff is great.

The food court is ok, but it's just not enough.  Yeah, it's great that they put some Cleveland originals into their tiny food court, but it's all essentially fast food only done with good ingredients.  There's no good sit-down restaurant option.  Cleveland has a ton of great food, and I don't want the casino to detract from our amazing restaurants, but at the same time, it doesn't have to completely forgo a sit-down establishment that servers high end food.  Adding another great restaurant to the scene isn't going to shut down East 4th, for example.   I give the food court 3/5 only because it's just not enough.  The food itself is fine.

Overall, I like this place, but it I also have to complain about how it just doesn't feel like its part of the city.  When I go to other casinos, I can get spa treatment, fancy food, maybe catch a show, etc...  This place is just gambling and some food/drinks.  That's fine, since Cleveland has plenty of downtown options--it's not like going to a casino in the middle of nowhere that absolutely must provide frills to keep people happy.  However, I think there's a lot of opportunity for the casino to partner up with the playhouse, local restaurants, and other retail stores in the vicinity as a means to grow business and help casino visitors experience all the great casino frills through Cleveland's local businesses.",2012-09-11 21:34:35

One of the hallmarks of a great restaurant is its people (friendly conversationalists score the highest marks), consistency in food and general overall treatment.  Went there today to meet an old colleague of mine.  Ordered the mac and cheese as I thought that was good last time I had it (I must have had my places wrong, I think it must have been the Garage, across the street).  I think they changed the mac and cheese recipe.  IIf I liked it before, it tasted pretty plain and uninteresting this time around.  I had five bites and sent it back.  The waitress seemed perplexed, and went about her way.  Thereafter, I ordered the Chicken ""Vings"" which were pretty good, but not really amazing or anything to write home about.  While I was drinking my drink, I noticed there was a large crack in the glass and I told my waitress about it (yes, that is a serious safety risk).  She brings me back my drink filled up at about the 1/4 level (which was less than I even sent it back with).  If a place is that CHINTZY and feels that way about THEIR CRACKED GLASSES, then it is not the type of place I will go back to.  A classy place would have apologized for the inconvenience at the very least.  instead, they wanted me to feel stupid for raising the point. Later guys, I will take my business to the whining pig around the corner, or the the garage.  Good place, there is fun to be had, but customer service is everything especially with my routine 25% tips.  Someone else will appreciate it I am sure.  Friendly suggestion - throw a little more cheese in your mac and cheese, it won't hurt your profits that bad!!

Peace out.  

Find your sizzle!!

The lunch specials were small in portion size for typical 'fake' Chinese food (eg. sweet and sour pork, general tsao chicken, etc). The meat had too much batter and there was too much celery and onions acting as fillers on the meat side. The vegetable side of the lunch special had the same celery and onions this time with trace amounts of baby corn and broccoli. Rice was generous.

The dumplings were ok. At $4 for 6, I thought they were pricey especially since they didn't taste particularly special.

The view from the window is spectacular. The waitress was friendly, but the restaurant was empty when I went in for lunch (?). They play Cantonese and Mandarin music in the background but the waitress doesn't speak Cantonese (?). Free wifi from the pub across the street (FnF).

I stopped in off of the street to get a pain au chocolat which they advertise for $3(they also sell baugettes, croissants, and a few other things in a similar way), but after learning that they bake them on-demand(pre-ordering recommended) and that it would take 15 minutes I opted for the apple tart I saw in the pastry case.

The service was friendly but the tart was actually priced as a full-fledged dessert, so that wound up costing about 3x as much as I had entered intending to pay. You might say that's my fault, and it would be more appropriately priced had I just finished dinner at this place, but to walk up to a counter and ask for something from behind the glass to be so expensive was a bit much for me.

C'est la vie, though - they sprinkled it with powdered sugar and sent me along my way with a small side of homemade caramel. When I got home, I gave it a taste, it was really delicious, and the caramel sauce was out of this world. I would eat that stuff on just about any dessert item they had. It took away most of the sting of the purchase, and I'm glad I stopped in, and I will return to get my pain au chocolat",2011-05-27 21:17:19

(I'm not sure where the dealers and addicts will loiter now.) The Bloordale Pantry keeps all the diner charm of The Dale, while updating the space so it's not so busted looking. There is a nice mix of new and old in the diner.

I arrived on the evening of their first night being open. Unlike the Dale, The Bloordale Pantry has a full blown espresso machine. I tried an americano and chatted with the waitress about the newly opened space. There aren't too many spots to get a good coffee in Blansdowne, so this new addition is welcome. Americanos pair will with Brunch, which the Bloordale also serves. I'll have to come back and check that out soon.

The americano was good, and the wait staff were friendly, so I decided to come back for dinner a few hours later. I had the pulled pork sandwich, with fries and coleslaw. It was really good; the fries in particular were really tasty. Apparently the menu will change week to week. Everything is made fresh in house.

I've been since for both brunch and dinner. For the brunch I thought i'd be adventurous and try the vegan pancakes. It was an experience, though i'm not sure i'd try them again. For my second dinner there I tried the burger. It's 100% ground chuck, no filler. Now that's a tasty burger.

Not a great experience. Upon arrival there were 6 people working the host(ess) podium and only 3 people in front of us. The people working seemed unorganized and confused. When a table finally was suggested it was in the bar. The restaurant was half empty and there was no one in the bar. We ended up taking the table in the bar because no effort was made by the host to seat us elsewhere in the restaurant after we said we didn't want to sit in the bar.  We ordered two sodas, I had the bruschetta and my partner the lasagne. The food was mediocre, but nothing new there. 

When the bill came we paid, the waiter came out and told us when he tried to run our card he got a message to call the bank. He didn't know what to do so gave us the card back and walked away from the table. OK then. 

I called the bank and they told me that there was no record of the restaurant even attempting to run a transaction on the card. She mentioned their payment processor was having an issue and cards had to be run by being entered manually. Since the staff didn't seem to have a clue, we paid via cash and left. 

We went to this restaurant to honor the memory of a dear friend we lost who liked to go there, and we had the meal we last had with her at the place. It will have to remain a nice memory, because we're not in a hurry to go back to this, or any other Olive Garden.

UPDATE (3/31): Chris with their guest relations department followed up apologizing for our bad experience, which we appreciate. We will give the restaurant another try and update our review after that experience. Follow-up by guest relations is a 5-STAR experience. Thank you Chris!

Update (4/22): So we revisited the restaurant last night and our experience was the polar opposite of our previous visit. The host was courteous and seated us at a great table. Our waiter (Chris if I recall right) was new. Only had been on the job for three days. He did a good job, he'll be excellent in a few days! The food was good and we left the place in a great mood.

Unfortunately they do not have a website, so I spent a lot of time online trying to get more information on them, but the few pieces on them that I did find, was very positive. AND they have jerk chicken on the menu- I LOVE jerk chicken!!! So I gave them a call and made a reservation.

On the evening of my reservation, I did have a bit of hard time finding the restaurant because it is located in a basement. But then again, I always forget to follow street numbers, so getting lost was on me. Once inside, I was greeted by Kim, a very cool and friendly hostess who got our dinner started on a positive note with her cool appeal. So let me summarize for you my experience...

The Good:

1) All mains are under $20! My dinner specifically was under $12! Oh yeah!

2) We got these yummy seasoned fried bread sticks with dip on the house as soon as we arrived. Free food--love it!

3) They were very accommodating with my hatred of onions. I got no onions in my jerk chicken (see the bill picture!)

4) There was a 10% off deal if you checked in on Yelp. Not everyone uses Yelp, yet Kim gave every one of my guests the 10% discount.

5) The service was very efficient. Although the restaurant was packed, and Kim was the only one working, we got our food very quickly.

6) And last, but not least, the food was delicious!

The Not So Good:

Here is what I like to do when it is freezing:

Look and the flyer online and construct my weekly shop based on what is cheap. Then email my order to them, have them pick everything out and deliver it.  This makes grocery shopping as effortless as ever and reduces the energy it takes to figure out what to make in a given week. Orders are usually 50 bucks with three heavy bags full of fresh produce, meat, and a few cheap pantry items.  

This is the place for you if you want fresh food- if you want cheap packaged food you will probably do better elsewhere unless what you want happens to be on sale that week.",2013-01-30 15:23:49

It is laid out well with prices that are not too out of line. Someone is there to see if they can help and will if you do and they will leave you alone if you don't.

The good..................
- Free parking.  Not sure if we scored it or what, but we drove up right to the front of the gates, drove in, and found a spot about 500 feet from the entrance.  It looked like a ""valet"" area, but we were able to score a spot, and nobody was there collecting money for parking. 
- Nice entrance up to the stadium with the stairs and cool sign out front.
- Decent smattering of Angel fans who really like baseball.
- Right off the freeway, very easy to get to.

The bad...................
- Clusterf#*#* of a ""promenade"".  Right when you walk in, you are bombarded with nowhere to walk.  Their ""standing room only"" section behind home plate and along the baselines are literally right in the area where people walk.  They have a painted line on the ground stating where you can/can't stand.  People buck up to that line to watch the game, thus leaving only a small area to actually walk by.  If you are claustrophobic, you will not enjoy walking into this stadium.
- Ticket prices.  Technically, I got these for ""free"" through a work rewards program, but even then, they were more costly than other stadiums.  SRO tickets were $21.00 I believe, and that is pretty steep.
- Minimal shade.  For most of the game, we hung out under the beer tent just for the shade.  The last 2 innings we went down to our ""seats"" and even then, still in the sun.

Overall, meh.  Too much of a cluster, too hot, too expensive.  Glad I saw the stadium once, but I am not coming back.",2017-03-15 18:35:36

Open 10 am til at least 10pm Monday thru Saturday and 10-6 on Sundays. Okay since I am assuming that most people reading this have never had the fortune to go to a Which Wich before. So let me explain. There are about 10 different bags when you walk in. Each bag will have a type of meat or category (seafood, turkey, vegetarian, breakfast, chicken.... you get the picture). There is also a gigantic menu above listing all the different types of sandwiches. Look which category the basic sandwich you want is at, then pick the bag. Then you choose which size you want. (small, regular, large, lettuce wrapped, or a bowl) Choose whether you want it toasted or not. Choose what type of cheese you would like as well as check all the vegetables and sauces and extras you would like on it. Write your name on the bag (and if you want to decorate the back you can see it travel the sandwich line) Then wait a couple minutes and enjoy your sandwich. It is really not that hard. It is just like Subway only you check the ingredients instead of tell someone. Only it is NOT like Subway as in it the taste and quality of the sandwich is out of this world amazing. I typically get the crab salad with avacado, and it never fails to be awesome. (also if you would like double meat or any other specials, you can simply write on the bag and they will be happy to accomadate your tastes.) Prices are $5.25, 8.50, and $11. You won't regret it, it is a huge gourmet sandwich that will blow your taste buds away.

Off the strip with a very chill vibe and a come-as-you-are dress code; this is my kind of place. We were lucky to score 6 seats at the bar on a Saturday night. The bartenders were totally cool- answering questions and explaining the drink ingredients, unlike the bar-snobs you sometimes find in places that make really great drinks. 

The fabulous CJ made the best cocktails we had all weekend- hands down! At CJ's recommendation, I started with a drink on their current winter menu called the Nevadan- bourbon, chartreuse, orange bitters- delightful! When I was ready for a second round, I said I like bourbon and amaro, and let him work his magic. OMG! He combined whiskey, two kinds of cynar, and perhaps one other ingredient to create my definition of what perfection tastes like in a glass. Apparently this one will be included on their next season's menu which means I definitely need to find a weekend to get back to Vegas. Or even better, am hoping CJ makes the trip to Phx for next month's Arizona Cocktail Week and decides to serve this at an event. A girl can dream, right? 

The rest of the soccer family agreed that this place was the winner.

I found myself at the Wildfire because there were some dudes working on my car down the street from there. Seeing as it was going to take them an hour to get me going again, I decided to walk out to the Wildfire. 

I don't know what I was expecting, but this place is really small. It's just a casino, so there's no hotel portion like Texas Station or Arizona Charlie's or anything like that. As such, the place is really small and there aren't (currently) any restaurants like the aforementioned properties. And I say (currently) because there's a burger place there about to open up, it seems. 

Since the place is gaming-only and has a bar, I should write more about that... except there really isn't much to write about. The bar is small, and the gaming area is small, too. I spent about 20 mins and $10 there, and I don't really have a lot to say about it.

So I heard from friends that this jerky was A-OK
But it's so expensive that I put it on LAYAWAY
Then I ran round back and ate it all in the ALLEYWAY
Then posted this review a few hours after XMAS DAY

I saved up my pennies, but not for a RAINY DAY
And eventually I went back to CzuchRAJ TO PAY
I ran in to LeBron, when I was ON THE WAY
And he gave me a ride, in a tricked out CHEVROLET

We drank wine all night, I think it was BEAUJOLAIS
And then King James asked me if I'd go ALL THE WAY
To Akron... his hometown... and who was I to DISOBEY
And that's when he told me who really killed JFK

I can't tell you what he said, at least not on BOXING DAY
But like Ari and her man, me and LBJ talk ERRYDAY
He just asked me if I wanna go to his manSION TO PLAY
(Bball) (and he said his eggs are bigger than FABERGE)

But that's TMI and I don't kiss & tell ANYWAY
And if I did I bet I'd Collide with a lawsuit like HOWIE DAY
I'm so glad that I went back to WSM to SQUARE AWAY
For all that luscious Jerky that I bought from J & J 

WHAT

So I've tried some of the famous places for jerky around the country and I have to say there is only one that has ever made any kind of an impression on me. That is right here. 

The spicy jerky here is worth eating and eating and eating some more - even though jerky is probably one of the very worst things that you can possibly eat, no matter what my military friends say. 

Even if you're not big into jerky, give the spicy jerky here a chance. It totally changed my opinion on jerky forever. I have yet to find one which is even in the same league as this.

Service can be really nice or not so great and prices are pretty high but you know what? When you have the very best version of your product that is available on the market it's worth whatever you charge for it. Within reason. And these prices are just about within reason.

While you're at the Market, also try a lemon & sugar crepe from the awful service spot Crepes De Luxe, and be sure to have a Brat from the wonderful Frank's Bratwurst too. These three items (along with this jerky) are the antithesis of the wurst things you can ever eat.

If you love them, contact me and I'll tell you more life-changing eats in NE Ohio, that aren't in this wonderful market.

And Daya would like me to rap some more about this jerky, even though she's from the Burgh (a lot of Clevelanders don't like the Burgh much).

Years later I was hungrier than Hanks in CASTAWAY
And feeling more current than Michael FARADAY
So I went to Cleveland looking for a FIANCE
And I found Daya doing Karaoke of HIDEAWAY

I told I could penetrate her deeper than a GAMMA RAY
And she said, only if I help her get a gift for FATHER'S DAY
So I didn't miss this opportunity to LEAD ASTRAY
A girl who went from ""Don't Let Me Down"" to being a RUNAWAY

We went to West Side Market and I said I had an MBA
She said that we could date, but not til SATURDAY
And in the meantime, did I know the way to SAN JOSE
I told her yes, but first, let's nibble on some TAKE AWAY

We had a Frank's Brat while we duetted on YESTERDAY
And at Crepes De Luxe it gave me pleasure to UNDERPAY
But like Sit Still, Look Pretty, this rap's on OVERPLAY

To my Yelp companions who made all that was Six completely tolerable and proved the point that whatever the case may be with a semi-retarded-but-really-cool-looking Scottsdale venue, if you're in good company, you'll still have a great time - raise your hands up in the air and say ""What! What!""

Essentially a pastrami sandwich and then on top of it are your veggies and a fried egg, then covered with another loaf of bread.

I ordered the Peking duck and my boyfriend got the Tempura onion ring. The Peking duck had house bacon with mizuna and charred plum jam. It was tasty and I think the steam buns complimented the duck but it was a little messy to eat. The tempura onion ring was ok. Just tasted like onion rings wrapped in a bun with pineapple flavoring. Then we got a Seafood Hot Pot and Massaman Udon. The bowls were a bit on the small side.. I could have paid $6 less and got a big bowl of pho. But anyways the Seafood Hot pot was good but not great. I liked the shrimp and scallop and the octopus fish cake. The only thing I would have liked was more broth . They filled the soup broth only 1/3 of the bowl. My boyfriends dish the Massaman Udons were delicious!! It had red curry with roasted duck, fingerling and pickled peppers. It tasted just like a Thai dish but instead of rice they served it with noodles. I wanted to eat his food instead of mine lol.

When the server brought our food, he first brought the chowmein. My husband and I got very confused as we haven't even been served our starter and this guy brought chowmein without our other Main Course dishes. I think they have no system, they don't plan how food should be served. This was another disappointment.
Food wasn't great either, it had a weird bitter taste. My husband said that it comes when you use dirty oil to fry. We couldn't eat anything so asked them for some boxes and packed everything to go.

I came across Kinkade's auto shop and stopped my search. 
TJ took the time to listen to what I thought was wrong and also explained that they provided a free diagnostic without having to agree to repairs if I didn't want any.  A very nice no pressure approach that was very refreshing.  I decided to take my car in on my lunch break. And was pleasantly surprised that they offered a free shuttle service.  Before the end of the day TJ was able to call and tell me what needed done now, what was recommended soon and what could be put off for some time.  I had originally planned on taking my car for a second opinion but after discussing it with TJ I realized this was the shop to use.  
By the end of the next day, my engine mounts were fixed, my oil changed, new brakes and so much more, it's was like I had a new car again.  Once the car was finished they picked me up at my house and took me to my car. 
Throughout the whole process everyone I encountered was extremely professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. TJ even took the time to recommend some awesome places to visit downtown since I recently moved to the area.  This is definitely an auto shop that cares about the customers and doing the job right.

This was followed by grilled bread with a mashed tomatoes, you could compare it to bruschetta, but with a latin twist. Then we got cheese balls, which were really crispy outside and very chewing and delicious inside and last but not least grilled octopus served on a toasty tortilla with avocado and feta cheese.

The hot food has a nice variety of dishes to choose from. The black miso cod that's pretty much a muramoto staple is always a great option. The pork belly is very flavorful, with cloves of garlic stuff inside the meat. And it comes with their housemade kimchi. The brisket has great flavors, though toward the end, it does get a bit salty if you eat the whole portion on your own. The fried chicken has a very light crust, definitely not your traditional fried chicken.

We've been looking for restaurants in Charlotte that remind us of the Northeast, and George's definitely fits the bill - stylish, casual, great menu and fun wine list. 

We sat outside, on the lovely patio that faces the common fountain (shared by Brio and Del Frisco's). The atmosphere really did feel a little bit Parisian, down to the small lights hanging from the awning to the wicker furniture. Really a lovely environment to have a french meal. 

We leveraged the house wine specials and had a carafe of the Sauvignon Blanc, excellent value and a good light white wine to start the evening. After a lot of debate, we settled on the green salad with dijon vinaigrette and the mussels in white wine. I've had a many renditions of this dish (including memorable versions in SF, Boston, and Spain). This was a very straightforward rendition, but the mussels were fresh and the broth was quite pleasant (and dippable). Salad had a bit too much dressing but was good otherwise. 

For our main meal I couldn't resist and order the steak frites (hanger steak with blue cheese butter). To me this dish is a true bistro test - if you can't cook a good piece of meat and make french fries, forget about making trout almondien or Beef Burgundy. The hanger steak was excellent, medium rare as ordered and clearly seared in a high heat environment. Fries were addictive (good sign) but over-salted. Oh yes, the blue cheese butter was as decedent as it sounds. My wife had the lobster ravioli special - 2 giant ravioli's made with 3 oz of lobster meat, served in a shrimp and tarragon sauce with a tomato coulit. Simply put, it was amazing - not a traditional bistro meal, but superb (and a great deal). 

For desert, we split the lemon tart - while the filling was very good and obviously fresh, the shell was slightly burned with really took away from the dish. 

Service was very well paced - some would say slow, but for those looking to enjoy their meal (and their company), it was just right. Our server was professional, gave us good suggestions, and wasn't obtrusive.

They thought the flavor was good and liked the combo. I opted for the oxtail pho. My bowl was tasty as the flavors from the oxtail made it great.  I liked how the meat was cooked and easily comes off the bone. We also ordered the oxtail fries and the beef salad. The fries almost reminded me of poutine fries. They were a bit soggy as the juices/gravy soaked in them. The beef salad was good as the beef was very tender (I wished the pieces were a bit better).,2017-08-09 01:19:43

Went with a party of friends, about ten in our party, we had found out that Fajitas does not do reservations, but we did give them the heads up that we are a party of ten and we are showing up around 5ish, so we got their and had to wait a few mins, but we didn't mind, gave us time to mingle with each other before being seated.

I still can't tell you what other items they have the on the menu, because I keep coming back for the beef fajitas which come with a plate of cheese, pico de gallo and sour cream, for me all this is enough, but you can order beans & rice to go with your jamming fajitas.

The location is good, near the Harbourfront and the Music Garden and marina, surrounded by tons of condo developments. It's the only restaurant west of Spadina near the Harbourfront, which is too bad as this area really needs more quality restaurants. I live just a block away.

My dinner there just okay. The service was prompt and courteous. The on-the-house amuse bouche at the start of the meal was a bit of a joke: a deep fried piece of maki, over-fried to the point where it was hard to tell what it was.  I had an horrifying thought that it must have been a left over piece of sushi that was battered and deep fried. The second amuse was a simple spoonful of soba in a soy mushroom broth -- not bad. I could do without these complementary offerings.

The restaurnant is run by Koreans which explains for the Korean dishes on the menu. I didn't feel like having Korean food and had an assortment of sushi, maki and sashimi instead. The quality was generally okay in terms of freshness and quality of cuts. The sushi rice was at least properly seasoned (though a bit on the light side) which is key starting point to a good sushi, the cut of fish is ample, however I've found the quality of the cuts of some of their raw fish to be rather poor. Their hamachi doesn't seem to be actually hamachi and I found their ""hamachi"" along with their other white fish to be rather tough and stringy which is a sign that you are not getting a quality cut of sushi-grade fish. I had to spit out a couple pieces into my napkin because it was way too stringy.
The two sushi chefs at the bar were polite, but very quiet and not as social as your typical Japanese sushi chefs -- they seemed to be more fixated on the Just for Laughs Gags that was annoyingly playing on their large flatscreen TV.  The surface of the bar was a bit on the sticky side (just like another reviewer's comments on the dining tables) and so was their plastic covered menus. It was a little off putting.
The cost of the dinner was very pricey considering the second rate quality and cuts of the fish.

I decided to give Guirei another chance by ordering takeout for dinner. Unfortunately the whitefish/hamachi sushi and sashimi pieces were still tough and stringy (I only ate one piece and spat or threw out the rest) along with a few pieces of tuna. The wakame salad was good, though the portion was rather small and it seems like they didn't have any leak-proof containers for it as the dressing leaked out of it (at least they did put it in a separate plastic bag that was tightly tied closed).

Next time I will definitely go to Ichiban Fish further east on Queen's Quay. The quality and taste of their sushi and other dishes are much better than Geirei, and never disappoints, and is cheaper as well.",2011-07-03 18:56:13

It's a great Mom and Pop restaurant the owners were super friendly and helpful.  Joey M. had a request for them to make some cheesy bread that wasn't on the menu and they were more than happy to oblige.  The dough for the pizza and for the bread sticks are the best quality I've ever tasted.  The dough was light and fluffy, but the crust of the pizza were crisp, it had a great garlic taste that really brought out the flavor of the pizza.  The pizza sauce tastes like it was home made too, very tomatoey and you can taste the herbs in the sauce.  The best thing is probably the quality of the toppings.  The cheese was the best I've ever tasted in a restaurant's pizza.  The pepperoni was spicy, the bacon was crispy, and the ham was fresh and sweet.  We got a large pizza which is 16"" take-out special for $8.97 for plain cheese and extra for each topping.  We can usually finish a large pizza pretty easily, but I could only eat one slice of pizza, Joey had three slices.  We were more than happy to take the other half home and finish it today!

Oatmeal was good. 

Both times we were there the servers customized our selections of sides to creat a meal and saved us $.

Single disappointment was whether you wanted hash brown patties or country potatoes, they were frozen and processed.  Would have liked fresh but or grated but that's a personal preference.

The guy checking us out at the register was very friendly and helpful. When I called after I left I found out his name was Cj... Anyway we didn't have the receipts because my mother in law gifted them without it and like we've done in the past, we just go in and give them our ID and they exchange it. Well a few of the tshirts were ""Guess"" brand and they couldn't locate similar shirts so they couldn't exchange them, totally fine no big deal because they were able to find two other matches and were able to exchange them. The reason why I'm writing this review is because the lady Diane or Diana was a total BITCH! I hope I have her name right because when I called the store after we left to find out her name, I'm almost positive it was her who answered because she had the same annoyed attitude that she had in the store... she was a shorter, thicker, woman possible in her late 40's with brown hair and glasses... what happened was when Cj had paged her in to come up to the front to ask for some help regarding the clothes, she came up and didn't say hello to us or anything (which is fine) but came up and was already bothered or in a hurry to run off and do something else... after hearing what I said and what Cj told her she walked off and said call ""Tyler"" (I think that's his name?... he was a tall, younger African American man who I believe was the manager)... he was great! Came up and greeted my husband and I and took the time to go look for a dress and came back and was able to exchange it... EASY PEEZY... anyway although I love marshals I will never be back at this location again and will drive 25 minutes out of my way to go to another one because of how rude Diane/Diana was... The impression I got from her was that it looked like because we didn't have the receipt or the Marshalls tag on the clothes that my mother in law must of gotten it from somewhere else... The clothes did have tags on them (Guess tags) just not the Marshalls tag... anyway like I said I will not be coming back here ... she's not a good example for her co workers under her because the way I was raised to work is you always put your feelings aside and if you have to pretend to be happy because you're having a bad day, well then you better put a smile on and represent the company the way the company would want you to represent them.",2017-09-10 17:46:25

There is a great variety of things on the menu. These tapas are pretty pricey, but if you want to treat yourself once in a while, then go for it. Everyone usually suggests the pork belly tacos. Pork belly is getting more and more common these days, but they use a watermelon salsa and surprisingly...it's awesome. I also recommend the sashimi tuna tacos and the veal short ribs. They were all pretty worth it. 

**I think the lamb lollipops are NOT worth it. It's one of the more pricier options on the menu and there's nothing that special about them. The lamb lollipops at Davidson St. Public House are better in my opinion.

Location wise, it is right on the corner of Yonge and Finch which I found this place after not wanting to wait in the most longest line for my bus EVER. I mean this FREAKING line was so Long. 

Regardless, the place wasn't that empty seeing that its a Tuesday night and I was immediately seated for one person. The vibe of this place was comfy but they play such GOD awful music here that having more than a couple of beers here would be much of a better place.

Luckily, I was sat in front of a TV that was at first showing TOO much commercials and not enough sports. The place itself has around 5 to 6 TVs that showed either soccer, WWE and other shows that I did not watch. 

The pricing is standard for bars specifically chained and generic sports bar that overprices everything. However they have specials including lunch, happy hour and different specials every day. And so I ordered the 1b sweet BBQ wings that seems to be half the price according to the special featured. 

I ordered a pint well two pints of Stella for myself (Pint of Stella costs 6.95 or so) and noticed some bits of debris floating at the bottom of the beer. I did not really taste the difference due to the fact of that but it was somewhat disturbing. 

The order of wings came by and I was surprised that the fries were wafflish kind of fries and it was cheesy and delicious. It really complimented the sauce. The wings itself was saucy and juicy but I find that half of the wings looked weird. I mean, I never had a wing that had a thing sticking out that I wasn't able to eat it. 

The service itself consists of two female waiters and a decent response time when I flag them down. The place wasn't that full but there were some instances that it was somewhat slow. 

My total bill was $35.10 and typically this amount of Stellas, Jamesons and wings and waffle fries is a reasonable price that is of a sports bar.",2012-11-07 02:47:42

I also wanted to try their macaroons, but they just get them delivered from Gabe et Jules. This was both disappointing and exciting. Disappointing because I would have loved to try them from somewhere new, but exciting because Gabe et Jules is my favorite spot for macaroons.

I will definitely go back. They had a lot of specials I would have loved to try. Smoked salmon eggs Benedict is most certainly next on the list.",2016-01-17 22:06:14

1) They take walk-ins for chest x-rays which is helpful for me and my crazy schedule.
2) The staff are always friendly, have never had any problems with the front desk or radiology techs. 
3) The office (including bathrooms) are always clean, and the waiting rooms have two TVs which helps the time go by while you wait.
4) I never have much of a wait when I go here once I am checked in, but the check-in process can sometimes take 30-45 minutes, even when there are only 2-3 other patients in the entire building. Seems a little excessive to me personally, but again as I said, once I'm checked in I'm normally done with imaging and out the door in ten minutes.

We shared the three amigos as an appetizer and we were underwhelmed. We liked the queso, but not the salsa (tasted store bought) or the guacamole (which was really just chopped up avocado). The chips weren't particularly good either. We didn't finish any of it. 

For the meal, I went with tacos. I ordered the stage five clinger, fat guy in a little coat, and looking good louis. When I ate these, the stars aligned and RuRus had kind of redeemed itself. I loved the tacos and would order those again. My friends got the burritos and they liked them.

My mocha smoothie with tapioca bubbles was delicious -- it included two different sizes of pearls (the standard size and a smaller, pebble-size), which I'd never had before. The dulce de leche cake was smooth and not too sweet, which was great. Also, the free popcorn they give you is a nice touch, though totally unnecessary.

I went there for a wine and coloring book event, but had dinner at the bar first.  It was warm in the bar, but even warmer (sweltering really) in the restaurant section.  The food was freezer fare that they made an attempt to dress up a little.  The buffalo chicken wrap had potential, but the thin buffalo sauce leaked all out of it and it ended up a big soggy, greasy mess.  The lettuce on it was questionable as well.  The sweet potato fries were passable and were served with apple butter, which was a nice touch.  It's still freezer food though.  I also found it really odd that they were filling their ice wells with 20 lb bags and were serving soda from 2 liter bottles. 

Once I moved to the dining area, I wasn't sure which was worse - the sweltering heat or the ""entertainment"".  At first, we thought ""what is with this music selection?""  The bar was playing contemporary country and this was stuff my grandparents would have listened to.  Then, we thought ""hmmm...this version of the song really sounds like bad karaoke"".   After looking around, we see a guy out on the patio with a karaoke machine.   Oh...that explains it.  It IS bad karaoke.   30 minutes later, though, we thought ""why is this same terrible guy still up there?""

Too much fat was left on and it was blended all over the meat you cant just cut a part and the fat is out.

If you know what to order, you're in the right place.  Why I love this place is variety and there's a lot of tasty ones.  My usual are...

- Grilled Beef Ribs that melts in your mouth.
- Enoki beef rolls that has a flavorful texture.
- Surf clam, salmon, and white tuna sashimi cut to perfection.
- Grilled egg plant cooked just right.
- Grilled Squid made just right without tasting like rubber.
- Teriyaki Salmon roll that has melted cheddar in the middle (odd at first but it has a good taste).  Tip is to order it early as it takes time to make and don't eat it right away.  It's really hot!

For a buffet, it's the best sushi place in the suburbs.  Can't argue with price which is favourable to my wallet.  I believe I took my girlfriend here for our second date and she's a fan!  When I asked her, she always have Yang on her mind.

If I can name one bad thing, it would be service.  Depending who you get, you might have to repeat yourself or orders never show up.  One incident was when they were out of white tuna, they didn't even let us know until I asked.  It needs improvement but the staff does look over work.

Roti Kanai: Its not Indian style naan nor is it West Indian Roti. It's Malaysian style; crispy and flaky served with a small bowl of curry chicken. The curry is mild in flavor but delicious. 

Beef Rendang: It reminds me of stewed curry beef maybe that's what Rendang means, there is way more flavor in the beef version of this dish than the chicken. 

Chili Chicken: This is a dry chicken dish. No, the chicken isn't dry it's just not in sauce. Its crispy and has a sweet and spicy flavor to it.

I think we were both in the mood for a drink with a homemade mix, but they use the premixed commercial stuff that you can find in just about any food store. The drinks were a bit on the weaker side, so we then transitioned over to wine (which, btw, we should have ordered in the first place). We didn't order any food as we ended up dining at the 7th Street Market later in the day.

First time, when I called for Father's Day dinner. Booked more than 2 weeks in advance. Was advised in advance that we would only have the table for 2 hours, which is totally fine. 

We were somewhat expecting the dishes to be like Fishman Lobster House in Scarborough where the seafood is topped up and we would be stuffed...from our previous numerous experiences...so we ordered a 5 person set dinner for 7 ppl.. 

The food dishes were particularly small,  in comparision, the ambience and seating area was better than Fishman Lobster House...(1 star)...nothing was Wow or spectacular in terms of taste...lobster deep fried, fish had a muddy taste, steamed king crab was the best thing perhaps... 

Around 7:15, when all the dishes arrived and we started eating maybe a quarter thru, they kept on asking us if they can take it and pack it away...I'm like is it time for us to give the table back? They said no. So why were they rushing us leave? They claim 2 hours but they want you to leave before 1.5 hours..epic fail....( minus 2 stars) I want to enjoy my food and company, not gobble down and leave....this is not a hk cafe... please...

The second time, same thing, rushing us to leave and realizing after the fact they didn't provide all the dishes on the menu..

So that's their business strategy..sit down, order the most expensive from the menu and rush you to leave so you won't have time to enjoy and figure out what was missing from the set...

I took my fiancé here because he's a big fan of red meat and I figured this is the right place for someone like him.  The service was pretty good and he enjoyed everything.  Of all of the offerings I sampled a total of 5 or 6 meats, including what appeared to be pink and possibly undercooked chicken.

That night my fiancé slept like a baby, while I had an experience straight out of the movie, 'Bridesmaids.'  The next morning he woke up 5lbs heavier and I woke up about 5lbs lighter.  I can't be sure it was the chicken but I had it and he did not.

The shop is unmarked, aside from an Open Sign and a big wooden door.

I ordered the Carmella, which was more like a shot than a latte (my mistake) but was absolutely delicious, nonetheless! And took about 5 minutes to get made and delivered to my table.

It wasn't noisy, there was still plenty of natural light and I see myself spending many more mornings frequenting this secret speakeasy-style shoppe!",2018-06-27 05:07:13

they claim they dont use MSG. its written on their business card. 

i had two regular bowls of wonton soup. the first was so savory. i didnt think anything of it. the 2nd was so savory i kept wanting more. uh oh... sure enough an hour or so later i was getting super sleepy and started to get a bad headache. two typical symptoms of ingesting too much MSG. right now i have a very annoying headache thats at the back of my head.

most places that serve wonton soup is going to have a ton of msg in it. i used to eat this broth the street vendors in korea would sell. they would boil the fish cakes in the broth. i asked the lady what made it so savory. she said MSG. the wonton tastes the same. 

i cant help but bitch about false advertising. a lot of people dont realize how many products use MSG. soy sauce, sausages, ranch dressing, etc... 

i still like this place cus their sauteed spinach and baked fish in soy sauce is so good. wait, is that the MSG talking?",2013-05-08 02:49:28

I was in Tempe. I was having coffee. I was sedate. I wanted to see if anyone wanted join me and discuss Kafka or something boring. And so I called up the town's most famous resident to see what was goin' down.

""Um, YOU need to see sketchy Tempe. It is time. And I will be the one who will show it to you. Meet me at Time Out Lounge. No, wait. Meet me at Monkey Pants. Yes, Monkey Pants!""

And so I did. 

Monkey Pants! Sorry folks, but this name is nonsensically awesome. I walked in and sat myself at the round bar, joining a smattering of other patrons sitting there by themselves, each staring into nowhere in particular. Well drinks for $2.50, served in a standard kitchen glass. Nice! I proceeded to watch the football game and was soon joined by my Tempe tour guide.

We were approached by the bartender to do discounted Patron shots....but only if we wore sombreros. There was barely anyone here on a Sunday night, and I'm of the kind who doesn't care anyway, and the thought of me and Bonnie G sitting at a desolate stripmall bar with sombreros on is kind of ridiculous and great at the same time, but shots were not on my agenda for the night. Alas.

I then got a royal tour of the place, including the great leg lamp (actually it's two legs, not just one!), shuffleboard, pool tables, couches with a cozy fire being played on endless loop on a big screen TV, ample board games and another section with tables and chairs, which is where we sat, under the painting of the teddy bear in Richard Simmons gear. 

Other patrons were seated all over the large space, so everyone had their own private area in a way. I actually really dug this. I'm not one who needs a place to be crowded to enjoy myself or feel like ""it's happening."" Sitting around a fake fire with pints and board games with a few friends is more my speed these days anyway. So I may sound decrepit, but I'm really not that old. I swear.

Sure, Monkey Pants has frat-party gimmicks throughout the day, but this place has no pretense whatsoever. How can you even take it seriously? Even it doesn't take itself seriously. 

I mean, it's just sitting there. In a strip mall. In Tempe. With a painting of a teddy bear wearing Richard Simmons workout gear on the wall and a stack of sombreros sitting next to a popcorn machine. Waiting for you to leave your critical mind behind and enjoy the now.

And enjoy the now we did. 

All thanks to my Sketchy Tempe tour guide.

4 stars.

Burger arrived on a plate alone and the plate looked bare.  Very odd layout for a restaurant.  There are about six tables that are right by the kitchen.  We were seated at the table across from the kitchen doors.  It was loud and chaotic as all the servers were passing our table within arms reach of us.  We could see in to the kitchen.  The doors leading in to the kitchen are black and had greasy hand prints all over them which was grossing me out as I ate.  The bars sits somewhat out in the middle of the restaurant so the back tables see the back of the bar.  There is an additional beverage/dessert bar that is waste of space.  The women's bathroom feels like an outhouse.  I am willing to pay a buck for a burger but I need a bit more atmosphere.  Went there on the first weekend or second they opened so overstaffed and hectic.  Even the hostesses were confused.  What appeared to be the owner or manager walked around using his cell phone most of the time looking overly anxious.,2012-01-05 18:16:13

staff at this location are never very friendly and ordering is painful. i honestly wish i could make my own rather than dealing with the uppity high school students applying a 4th layer of lip gloss and are more interested in who's dating who and what party they're going to after they get off work than engaging a customer.

the weird names for sizes, ""like it"" and ""love it"" are annoying and awkward to say. i ask for a small and the employee always corrects me: ""you mean a like it""? whatever. i don't know what a ""like it"" is, but i know what a ""small"" is.

I had eaten brunch here numerous times before the reno to The Sister.  GREAT for a hangover, prices were reasonable and the kimchi breakfast sandwich is wicked. They also make a decent ceaser.

I live really close, and usually end up at Mezzrow's if I want a drink. IF I want food and a drink, I'll head to The Sister.

Recently I've had the blackened fish tacos, which were fantastic.  My bf had a reuben I believe, which he loved.  Their fries are delicious. Half sweet potato half russet.

We also stopped in last week and shared a lb of wings, which are baked btw.  We ordered the Moroccan dry rub which was AWESOME. A little spicy, you could taste the cinnamon, a little sweet.. and a great crunch.

During that visit we also shared the baked chicken sandwich, which we thought was going to be a chicken breast, but to our surpise, it was a pulled chicken sandwich. Delicious. Sweet and tangy, not too saucy. The bun was fresh and perfect for the sandwich. We were really pleased with the meal.

You order off a board and and they bring the food out to ya, doesn't have a full bar but features a couple beers on tap/bottles and has a strong sports bar feel to it. Not sure why but this location seems to have ton of employees working (really just standing around) so service is pretty quick.

You can pick from regular or boneless wings along with a couple different sauces/dry rubs. If wings aren't you're things they have some other stuff on the menu also, along with fried pickles, kinda random but worth checking out lol.

I can't say much on the regular wings, not a fan of bone, but the boneless ones aren't bad. I kinda noticed that the breading was a little thicker than bdubs but still good. The wings are served wet, plenty of sauce/rub and are pretty big. Flavor range on their sauces is pretty standard, hot, medium, teriyaki, bbq, garlic parm, nothing unique Unfortunately for what the place is, its not cheap, about $10-12 bucks for a 8 piece combo with their soggy-ass fries and a drink. Overpriced for what you get and they still charge you a buck for ranch, smh... After lunch they have a daily ""happy hour"" specials that change each day, but they are pretty meh...

Drove twice around the carpark before realising this place is literally INSIDE the Lee Lee market, and there is NO sign, not even a sandwich board, indicating this on the outside! Went in and got seated immediately. Water brought out quick. Orders taken and served quick. That's where the delight ended. They didn't have the fresh coconut that I normally get so that was disappointing.  My ""large"" pho was ok, but I wouldn't classify it as a large. Maybe a medium. Broth tasted ok. Hardly any of the sliced beef balls or tripe, or in fact much meat at all. Small handful of bean sprouts and a single tiny lime slice provided. My kid had the crepe with bean sprouts, shrimp and pork. Yuck. I had some - the crepe tasted bland and ten minutes later, cold (my kid tried his best to delay actually eating any, can't blame him), I wouldn't have served it to a dog. Wife thought her vermicelli and BBQ pork was okay and liked the ""fresh"" taste, but thank god the fish sauce was on the side. Ugh. Absolutely NO table service after we'd started, not even offers to refill water. Had to get up and walk around to the tiny cash register to pay. Got back to table and sat down to wait for the kid to strangle down another couple of bites and that's when I had an ice water jug held in front of me as a refill offer. Nope, done.

This place is nowhere near as efficient or generous with their portions as either Pho Thanh (Camelback) or Da Vang (19th Ave). Those who think the prices are cheap need to understand that those prices are normal for a viet place. They're all this cheap, except the ridiculously-overpriced Rice Paper on 7th Ave. Go to Pho Thanh (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-thanh-phoenix), order the large pho dac biet for $6.75 and run a comparison of what you get.

Their eggplant parm is amazing and very tasty. Its as if they add something 'extra' to the breading that other places don't. My husband had a sandwich and he said the filling was great along with the dressing but the bread was a bit hard. 

The appetizers don't fail- I go for the appetizer that has cheese sticks, zuchnni, mushrooms and artichoke hearts in it and it really wonderful. The deserts also don't fail. 

We did try the stuffed pizza and we had mixed reviews here- I love it, my daughter loved it but since it was stuffed with ricotta cheese and my husband not being a fan of ricotta it didn't go over too well. The large pizza is HUGE to say the least and they don't skimp on toppings. 

I recommend this resturant if you want pizza, pasta or even a slice of cheesecake but their sandwiches could use better quality of bread..Other then that, Its a great place to eat and get your comfort food fix.",2012-08-17 23:25:19

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

When I first walked into Wurst I was struck by the upstairs restaurant's beautiful decor. There was a huge tree growing out of the floor and sparkling lights that made me feel like I stepped into an enchanted forest (very romantic). Immediately downstairs is Wurst's Bavarian Beer Hall - a completely different atmosphere and a gong show on the weekends. Either go really early on a Saturday or make reservations if you want to guarantee a seat. 

The Beer Hall area was dark, yet intimate and lively with neat German trinkets on the walls. As the night progressed, the hall became more crowded and loud from drunks and the blaring German band tooting out festive tunes. You have to yell at the people in your table to talk to them. The waitresses are dressed up in traditional German bar-maid attire and for the most part are really friendly and attentive. You definately get a true German Beer Hall experience!

Every Saturday they even have a contest to see who could hold a Stein of water in front of them the longest. Winners get a $25 gift certificate.  

The biggest turnoff was that the food and drink prices were inflated - my bill came out to be around $40 for only two beers and an appetizer! 

They have a decent amount of German bottles and drafts including pilsners, wheaty Weizens, dark Dunkels, and the popular fruity Stiegl Radler (grapefruit). 1/2 a liter will cost at least $7.25-$20; 1L is from $14.50-$20; and a 2L Boot is from $38-$40. Granted, it's fun to drink from a boot shaped mug but if you want to save money opt for two 1L drinks. 

Their food menu felt more like ""German inspired"" and not purely focused on the cuisine. Appetizers are from $15; cured meats ($9-$13); cheese; seafood (shellfish); rotisserie and grill items like hamburgers ($16), brats ($26), and schnitzel for two ($35); and from their carvery you can get 1/2 or 1 lb of chicken, prime rib, pork loin, brisket, ham, or sausage ($14-$25). Each carvery order comes out on a wooden cutting board with meat on one side, two slices of your choice of bread and sauce. You can either eat it separately or as a sandwich. My friends seemed to enjoy it and were stuffed by the end. 

For a real treat, you can order 'Franzl's Mixed Grill' which is a big platter of house made bratwurst, knackwurst (light colored sausage), prime rib, schweinshaxen (roasted ham hock/knuckle), Kassler pork loin (tough to eat and fatty), German fried potatoes, and bread dumplings on top of a pile of spatzle (soggy, bland egg noodle-like thing) and warm sauerkraut. They charge you $39/person for two people ($78 platter), but it can feed 4-5 people. It's a great opportunity to try a variety of German meats but the overall consensus was that it was really salty and pricey.

Other items I tried were the ""famous"" 'Bavarian Wings' which was only OK. For $15, you get three large wings stuffed with sausage, then breaded with pretzels and hot sauce. I was expecting actual chicken meat as part of the wing, but it was more like 98% sausage meat encased by ""chicken skin"" instead of the usual sausage casing. The wings were not crispy and the hot sauce only added a bit of heat. The order will definitely fill up one person, but is good to share amongst 3 people. For $15, this appetizer wasn't worth it. 

I also got the 'Schnitzel Tacos' ($16) which were four, two-bite hard shell tacos with a tiny portion of crispy schnitzel. The tacos were bland unless you dipped it in the accompanying Valentina (mildly hot) sauce. The dish was really hard to eat since it fell apart after the first bite. I would NOT recommend this dish. 

What I do recommend is the 'Pretzel Bucket' ($7) - about four warm soft, chewy pretzels with a crisp exterior. The four accompanying mustards were a perfect compliment. The 'Duck Fat Fries' ($8) were also surprisingly good and the portion was enough for one person.

If you already haven't been here, the Beer Hall is a great place to visit with a group of friends. You will definitely have a good time bonding with other drunks! The only drag is that the food and drinks are expensive.",2012-08-17 19:14:05

When we FINALLY got to order (just chips and salsa, cuz the kitchen was closed!) we weren't sure if the order ever got put in by the bartender. When a confused guy came out of the kitchen with a plate of chips and salsa, I pounced on him, not sure if it was my order. It was, thank god. The salsa was decent but the beans which they provide with the chips were AMAZING!! Highly recommend!! We got kicked out like half an hour later, which I was not capable to drive yet.

I want to love this place because the format reminds me of my favorite Indian restaurant chain in Austin - Tarka. Unfortunately, I've been kind of disappointed in the food and dining experience.
Both times I went, it was totally packed inside. Sure, it is new, and people are excited to try it. The space is vast - well, the vertical space is. Seating space, however, is pretty limited and cramped. Some parts are right up against the windows and line, and there's little room for patrons to move around, get toppings, and employees to bus the tables. It is also quite loud. They play music that sounds like you're shopping at an H&M.

As for food - it isn't bad. But also, it really lacks that punch of flavor that I've come to expect and appreciate from Indian food. It really tastes like they dialed back the spices and heat to appeal to the midwest palette, and I'm not very happy about that. They don't offer any spice level when you order - but do have some hot sauces in the condiments area. Unfortunately, those just aren't the right flavor profile - they taste more on the tabasco pepper side of the sauce spectrum, and less on the delicious hot curry spice side. It's just not the same.

Mango lassi is delicious.
Samosa chaat is also quite good.

I wish they didn't use so many disposable plates, cups, plasticware. Another negative compared to Tarka.

All in all, I think this place is a fine quick alternative to, say, Chipotle, but if you really want quality and interesting flavors - look to one of the old-school restaurants like People's Indian, Tamarind, or All India.
In reality, I can get in and out of People's Indian just as fast as here.",2018-02-11 03:52:50

The main reason is because with the exception of Arigato (Korean/Japanese) & Pho Tai Loi (Viet/Thai), & Dynasty BBQ (more Chinese-BBQ dishes) stalls, they're all the damn same.  

Most of the stalls offer Fried noodles, rice, rice with pork chop, spicy fried pieces of fish, etc.  Customers either have their go-to place OR they try a different place each time.  I suspect that some stalls are owned by the same person.

I came because I wanted to order from Pho Tai Loi, but by 6pm on a Monday evening, it was closed.  Arigato & Lemongrass were both also closed.  Maybe they're all closed on Mondays.  There are also a coupla places that serve BBT.

1. Find the best sales person you can that could literally sell ice to an eskimo and put them at the front where the clients come in.
2. Promise the world when it comes to upgrading the wash.
3. Agree with anything the client wants to when it comes to what they want and just get them to pay.

The rest is really a crap shoot. Today, I took in my truck in and explicitly asked for nothing with gloss to be put on the dash as it blinds me for several days until the effect wears off. Additionally, the stuff they use soaks into the speaker grills and looks terrible once its baked in. I made myself exceptionally clear and they went ahead and put on the high gloss stuff. OK. I can handle it. The issue was that it was put on in a way that about 70% of the dash was covered with glops of the substance they used to clean it.

I decided to go simple for my first time, and ordered the merguez lamb sausage with sauerkraut and pickled jalapenos.  On the side, I had a small order of duck fat fries with chipotle dipping sauce.  Yep, I like things spicy!  Made all the better by the fact that they have a self-serve cooler of ice water.  Unfortunately it seemed to be all ice when I tried to use it, but the bartender kindly came over and filled it for me.  

My meal was served to me fairly quickly, and I was happy to see that I got two sausages in the bun because they were on the smaller side.  The bun itself was lovely, I believe a ciabatta?  I could be wrong, but it was fresh and delicious.  The sausages were a bit spicy on their own, so with the jalapenos I was glad I had the fries to cool my mouth.  The flavour of the merguez was fantastic, a really tasty sausage.  The fries too were great, although I'd like to compare to the regular fries to really see the difference.  The chipotle sauce was the perfect compliment to my meal, especially since I tend to find chipotle more sweet than spicy.  

All in all, a nice atmosphere with very friendly staff, great sausages and fries, the only drawback is that it's a little on the pricier side ($13 for everything) but for something so unique I'm willing to fork it over.

I've been working with Rex, who has been helpful, but the negotiation process is not as expected.  Rex explained to us that they simply do not go below MSRP.  I found this very odd, so I started doing a little research.  TrueCar (who uses real data points from actual car purchases) shows that Land Rover sales nationwide are often below MSRP.  Furthermore, I called a few dealership in So Cal and they assured me that there is definitely room to negotiate. 

Before sharing this information, I talked to my sales guy and told him I really needed him to work with me...he ""had to call his manager at home"" to get me the discount, and told me that this is the best deal he's seen on this model of car.  

Fine.  It is still not an impressive deal.  

I spent a half day at the Lincoln dealership in Henderson (AWESOME place by the way), who gave me a SMOKIN' deal, including 2 years of service (oil changes and all!) as well as...wait for it...free car washes for life. WHAT?!  

But...I still like the Evoque better than the MKC.  So now, I'm torn.  I'd prefer to choose a company who is willing to work with me on price and actually cares about giving their customers a great deal.  The Land Rover dealer seems a little ""too cool for school,"" and not really interested in helping me getting a great deal in a car I'll be happy in.

Came here with a fine group of yelpers for some family style Italian cooking, but who knew that they had such an enchanting cocktail list? There were some real classics on their list too: a pair of his and her manhattans, a sazerac, and a killer option called the bulleit maple sour. Get this. Bourbon and whisky afficionados will adore this cocktail collection. I'm drooling just thinking about it.

Anyway, let me put my drink down and get on with it.

Campagnolo is a gently-lit enclave (at Dundas West and Euclid) with a sparse yet rustic look. Mostly tables for four and a few long tables for groups, there is a congenial and warm atmosphere about the place.

The menu changes frequently. On my first visit I shared a shit-tonne of deliciousness with my partners in Yelp including a pretty solid sea breem, a great wild boar on polenta and a passable papardelle. And a lot of us in the group were pleased with the Burrata Cheese and Roasted Grapes appetizer. A simple idea pleasantly executed.

My second visit was also pretty strong. Two of us shared crispy and flavourful testina in a tart vinagrette and a buttery duck rillette piled high on crostini. Both fabulous. For dinner she got the Eggplant Parmesan and I grabbed the steak and potatoes. I didn't try the eggplant[1] and my meal was fine. I wasn't wowed by the steak (and it was so thin that in places it was overcooked) but the potatoes were splendid. Four potatoey prisms the thickness of Vegas dice. I enjoyed them a lot.

Good on you, Campagnolo. See you again soon.

Obligatory Title Pun: Campag-YO-lo.

Menu Readability: Well laid out but Times Roman?

Need to mention: Rumour has it that they might be installing a patio and garage door this summer, but you didn't hear it from me.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'm a cock of all 'tails.

So...where to begin?

Let's start with the service. If you haven't noticed, service is a big deal to me. I work in a service industry, I appreciate customer service, and I know what it takes to provide good service (most of the time it's just being nice - ya, that's pretty much it). The service at this establishment was very hit and miss. Our waitress, Stacie had moments where she was very attentive and nice and moments where she was quite possibly the most overbearing and annoying server I've ever had. Let's start with the bad. I understand that every server has a unique style that works for them. However, Stacie felt that it was necessary to call my wife and I ""Young man"" and ""Young lady"" every time she stopped at our table. She literally (no exaggeration here) said those phrases at least 25 times while we were eating there. I'm not sure how old she is, but certainly wasn't old enough to use this term. It just came across as obnoxious. I'm not 5, I'm not in trouble, and your not in a senior citizens home, so don't call me young man. Do you need a refill young man? Can I take your order young man? And you young lady? Anything else young man? STOP IT!!!! Stacie then asked us if ""our food was delicious."" Unfortunately it wasn't, and this bothered her. She managed that situation very well and it's obvious that she cares about the product coming out of the kitchen. For that I praise her, I just don't care for an overbearing, loud, obnoxious personality when I'm dining (unless I'm at Dick's Last Resort). 

Now to the food. We tossed around the idea of trying a few different restaurants. I'm sad we didn't pick the others. This was our second experience with Famous Dave's and it was equally, if not more disappointing than the first. I just don't see what others get out of this place. Their bbq sauces at the table might be some of the worst tasting sauces in the history of bbq. I ordered a pulled bbq chicken sandwich with a side of jalapeno mac-n-cheese. My sandwich was okay, the chicken was very dry though. The mac-n-cheese was awful. It tasted like they cooked the mac-n-cheese then just dumped the jalapenos in after everything was cooked. Not good. My wife ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. All I could smell was burned chicken. It came with nothing on it, the meat wasn't seasoned at all, and it was very overcooked. She ordered the slaw with it which she said was very good. The sandwich was boring, overcooked, and the presentation was very undesirable. 

Upon telling the server that the food wasn't ""delicious."" She sent over a manager. We appreciated him stopping by, and we were very honest with him. He did everything right and offered to replace my wifes sandwich. We declined and told him that this was our second experience here and we just weren't satisfied. He gave us various options but we decided to just stick with what we had and agreed that this would be our last experience at Dave's. 

Lucille's at the District is a much better BBQ option that Famous Daves. I'd rather just not eat than have to eat here again.

Famous Daves...you are the weakest link...goodbye.",2011-03-24 18:41:25

They had, quite possibly, the best thai food in the Cleveland metropolitan area.  Then, it closed down and was replaced by a new restaurant called High Thai'd.  High Thai'd kept the decor, kept the menu, and changed the food.  For the worse.

So what did I do?  Mint Cafe's website directed me to this place in Pepper Pike (oh god, where is Pepper Pike??).  I was discouraged for a couple of months, but last month I decided to drive the half hour here and check it out.  Found this place located next to a supermarket in a shopping area deep within Pepper Pike suburbia.

Well, lo and behold, this is Mint Cafe.  The decor is different, the menu is the same, and the food is the same!  Even the signature Golden Bags appetizer that I used to love at Mint Cafe is here at the Pepper Pike place.  Had the Pad See You and the Tamarind Duck - both had a good mix of flavors (weren't overloaded with ginger) and were reminiscent of the quality thai food I used to have at Mint Cafe.  The waiters were even wearing Mint Cafe uniforms! (no seriously, they said ""Mint Cafe"" on them!)

They were a bit overstaffed on the Sunday evening that I tried the place, so they were constantly refilling my water.  But I guess that's a good thing, too. =)

Got there at 2:30 pm, but was almost thirty minutes early to meet my dining companion.  As such, I sat down but didn't order anything.  A male server came by to give me water and ask if I wanted anything else, but I told him I'd wait for my guest to arrive.  During this time, I studied the decor.  Very nice.

When my guest did show up, there was the only snafu of the night.  It must be that they do shift change at 3 pm, because we were ignored for 25 minutes (like, we sat there without being asked for drinks, etc, NOTHING) until I finally had to find someone myself and ask her WTF was going on (my guest was ready to leave at this point).  She apologized and then took our order.  NB: I asked for an aperol spritz, which isn't on the drink menu, and they had it!

After we got our drinks, a managerial looking guy came over and apologized for the confusion and assured us the rest of the visit would be smooth.  An appreciated touch.

Now for the food!  I got the tavern chop salad to start -- GET THIS.  It's expensive but you can tell the ingredients are top quality.  Then I had the burger - just okay, the fries were good.  Everything is about $5-8 overpriced.  That's the area for you.

To be  beaten by Food trucks and several bars may not be a disgrace but there are better offerings at ice rink restaurants within the valley. Not saying anything else on the menu is awful but that was the main reason this restaurant was chosen.

I don't have a problem with the food, but when we sit down and spend $100+ on dinner, I realized I like a more calm and relaxed experience when I eat out.

I expected the cupcakes to be expensive, but I was still bowled over by the $3.50 price for a single, very average sized cake.  The selection was pretty good - everything from the standard chocolate and red velvet to peanut butter and cherry.  I asked the woman at the counter for her recommendation and she said everyone seems to love the red velvet but her personal favorite was the Tropical Vacation, which had coconut and a pineapple filling.  I purchased my cupcake and took it back to the office with me to enjoy.

I was impressed by the packaging, and I suspect that's where the bulk of my $3.50 (plus tax) went.  The plan white cube had an interior cupcake tray so the cupcake wouldn't go sloshing around.  It was a nice touch.  I just finished eating my afternoon treat, and here are my thoughts:

- Average size
- Heavy, but that's due to the huge amount of very heavy frosting
- The consistency of the cake was very nice - not dry, not too dense, just right
- The coconut flakes in the cake itself was a very nice and unexpected treat.
- I expected the cake to be coconut flavored, but it wasn't - it was just a white cake.
- The pineapple filling had absolutely no flavor aside from ""sweet""
- Way too much frosting.  The sugar overpowered whatever little bit of flavor the cake or filling may have provided.
- The frosting itself was way too dense.  I was able to pick it up and break off a piece without it getting messy or falling apart.

I really, really wanted to love Cupcakes by Design and would have gladly paid $3.50 for a really spectacular cupcake, especially when the flavor selection is really unique, but I can't imagine I'll ever go back unless their prices drop by a couple bucks.",2010-10-07 19:59:42

Yes I know nerd alert here) JW usually does a Billy Joel and Elton John tribute. Ha! Last year I even got to sing and dance on stage to Crocodile Rock. Na-na-na-na-na  Na-na-na-na-na!  Don't ask, but life goal number 1 completed! LOL! Well as far as last night goes, all I can say is that we were rocking the place. ( Well ok as far as one can rock out to Simon and Garfunkle) I am sure the conductor was cringing at how rowdy the third row was. Teeehhhee! We were jamming out to the music. 
( Yes sorry handsome conductor man. I know it is the Symphony and probably made you cringe with all that classical training in the house. Then the NY, Alice Cooper gang hooligan types came in-hahaha thus why I like the Pops more than the classical. I will go to classical shows too so really I am just kidding. However. I do love the pops so much more. I know, I know, I feel like ""Just Jack"" from Will and Grace. I love me my musical theater and showtunes, Gleek here.  
   Last year I even got to see my all time musical theater hero diva perform,  Patti Lupone. SIGH! Got to meet her after the show too. Thanks Phoenix Symphony for that photo op! (Life goal number two, check!) Advice, now if you could only get Mandy I would truly be in heaven. ( Life goal check number 3 perhaps?) 
   However, I do went to point out they do have something for everyone with an eclectic yearly calendar of different musical genres. I do worry about cultural Arts programs and budget cuts in Az so hope people continue to support them in any fashion. I know it is not NY or London but it's still good!  I also love it when I see the young set being introduced to the Symphony. We sat next to a delightful 13 year old young man last night. He was rocking out with us. ( Ok Dad listens to S/G in the car every day. But at least the boy didn't  appear to be having his teeth pulled out by being there)  So to all of my fellow music lovers, check it out, support local Arts, and enjoy!

Sansotei have multiple locations, one of which came newly to Markham if you live uptown. It's is on the plaza on Hwy 7 where Whole Foods Is.

This location seats about only 30 people. You may or may not need to share a table depending on the size of your party.

Their ramen is delicious with a smaller menu than most places. There is only about 6 choices of ramen and some add ons. Includes your regular tonkotsu. They also have a tomato and a spicy one. I personally like the broth of the black. I find their ramen are basically same few things (eg. Poek belly, egg, etc.) and the only changes are the soup base. They also have sides/ appetizers and beer (sapporo and black Asahi).

I tried their spicy wings.. beware the spice does kick In but the meat falls off the bones. The gyoza is good but nothing special. 

Their beers are bottled not draft.

I got in a bit early and waited at the bar before they open. Didn't get a chance to the menu before hand but osso bucco was already on list of things to try. 
My dining companion arrived later. Here is what we had 
fried rissoto balls. Just beautiful not the dried version one gets nice crispy on the outside with the creamy moist center
crepe with butternut squash. These were average IMO. The sauce was done well here.
My DC ordered the chicken which was stuffed (light on that) though cooked well. It was moist but lacked seasoning IMO.
The osso bucco hit it out of the park. Just gorgeous slathered in rich sauce with the meat that was perfectly tender and the center of marrow. Top dish on this outing.

--actual STEAMED fresh vegetables, not micro frozen. see what little effort it takes?
--loved the ""buffalo"" potatoes; nicely cooked, bite-size, drenched in wing sauce with ranch for dipping. BING.
--really pricey for what it is. $14 for a basic salad? where do you think we are, Scottsdale?
--too many windows, too much light to be a proper pub
--decor from some pick-by-page-and-letter Irish kitsch catalog.
--um. there's a metal fishnet thing on the ceiling!
--all two- and four-tops except for a giant picnic-table size 16-top: you can't bring your extra 0.6 out of 2.6 children -- who needed him anyway?
--ding for leaving my half-and-half on the bar for 5 minutes; this is a PUB, lady! Don't keep me from my Guiness and Harp!

Something surreal about the popup mall that sits across from a dead field. And right on the corner is the Auld Dubliner. Far too many windows for a proper pub. Fill those in, man! And what do we get to look at? The empty dead field across the street.

nTjDw-SA5OU6o0vHrKmN5A,HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg,mQkzRJ2I0LGG6Cv4EbEjEQ,3,3,0,2,"Came to Brunchworks Cafe today with a voucher in hand for $20 worth of food and drinks with William T..  Upon arriving (around 1PM), there was a short wait between 20 to 25 minutes.  Luckily, the wait was shorter than anticipated and we were given the menu to browse while waiting.

The interior reminds you of a local diner that parents would take their kids to on a Sunday, or somewhere, where a group of girlfriends get together for breakfast à la Sex and the City.  There are big windows which allow for a lot of natural sunlight.   They also have an impressive display of desserts; cakes from La Rocca; pastries and other desesrts from Dufflet.  Fresh juices are also available and the choices are scribbled on to a chalkboard close to the many board games that are available (Battleship, Sorry and Operation just to name a few).

A while after, our orders were taken.  Water was dearly missed at our table but that was easily remedied when requested.

Espresso comes out of a Nespresso machine that takes discs and comes in levels of boldness ranging from 2-10.  Serious espresso drinkers may be slightly offended at the sight of a Nespresso machine - but I didn't mind.  I got a double espresso and it was just the right level of boldness at 7 for me.  My dining companion got a regular coffee (free refills) and it was a medium roast.

On the table you will find individual packets of Kraft Peanut Butter, Kraft Marmalade and Kraft Strawberry Jam.  Milk, cream, sugar, salt, pepper and ketchup are also at your disposal.

I opted for the soup of the day, which today, was a Chicken and Wild Rice Soup.  When it arrived I nearly fell off my chair because the portion size was more suitable for 2 than for 1.  The ""wild rice"" was lacking as was the chicken.  Orecchiette was used in place of rice.  The soup was nice and thick, and was chunky and filling served with olive oil drizzled crostinis. 

I ordered the Little Italy Omelet substituted with egg whites (+$1.95) with sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and mozzarella cheese.  The dominant flavour came from the sundried tomatoes as mozzarella cheese is a rather mild cheese.  It came with a side of home fries and serving of fruit (grapes, pineapple, cantaloupe, honeydew melon and orange slice).  It also comes with your choice of: white, whole wheat or rye bread.  The bread comes toasted and buttered.   

My dining companion ordered the Huevos Bruncheros with eggs over easy.  A tortilla topped with sour cream, salsa, guacamole, refried beans and Chorizo - it was definitely a feast for the stomach, but also for the eyes.  This also came with a serving of fruit.  I did notice the eggs were slightly overcooked, but otherwise, a very savoury dish.  My word of advice is to mix everything together before you devour so that you get to taste all the flavours in every bite.  Delish!

Verdict:

Although there are fancier brunch joints in the city (think Leslieville or Trinity Bellwoods area), I do love myself a greasy spoon diner once in awhile.  I would recommend Brunchworks as the food is actually quite healthy and not greasy at all.  The atmosphere is very laid back; somewhere you can either go solo with a newspaper in hand; somewhere you can have a brunch with a bunch of gal pals; somewhere you can treat your family to; and yes it is even somewhere you can take your significant other to.

If you are lucky you will find street parking at Robina Avenue, but if not, there are plenty of affordable Green P lots in the area.",2011-12-05 15:16:46

It has a great little menu with pictures so you can see what the food will look like when it comes out and it can help you decide on what you want. We're pretty critical on Japanese restaurants here in Las Vegas because a lot of the times if you want good fish you have to pay a lot and most restaurants freeze their fish which makes it lose the taste. This place was pretty good. We ordered the grilled squid which I really enjoyed. The yellowtail and grapefruit which was good except I'm not too much of a fan of grapefruit. We also ordered the beef carpaccio and the tuna carpaccio which was also pretty good. We ordered other plates but those were the best. At the end of the bill we were surprised it only came out to less than 80 dollars because we ordered a good amount of food. I would definitely recommend this place to others for a good priced Japanese restaurant.,2015-07-06 13:54:53

I also sometimes go to the Monday/Wednesday/Friday exercise classes- also taught by Lori Day.

The women are friendly and well-informed and it almost feels more like a club than a class.  

The staff here is always friendly and helpful.  They have an activity card that you can earn stamps and redeem for things.

They have both outdoor and indoor pools so that you can keep swimming all year.  The outdoor pool is a normal public pool complete with fun things for the little ones and slides.

Stripsteak is located in Mandalay Bay, where all the restaurants are, before the Mandalay Bay conference rooms and ballrooms. 

When you walk up (hopefully with reservations as this place gets BUSY!) there is a full bar with a seating area. Luckily, we were able to get a table without reservations at 7:00pm on a Monday night. They sat us at a nice table, right in the middle of the action. It's a tad loud in there so bring your listening skills. 

After you are seated and given the menu, they bring out three little containers with french fries and dipping sauces. Now these are not your McDonald's fries. These are the most amazing fries you will ever have. 

The first one had french fries with old bay seasoning and a mustard herb dipping sauce. 

The second one had french fries with oregano and ketchup. 

The third one was knock-your-socks off amazing. French fries in duck fat with truffle dipping sauce. Are you fucking kidding me?!?! The minute we all tried these we all looked at each other and said ""these are goddamn delicious!"" 

All three had fantastic flavor with good crisp on the outside. 

But yea- duck fat + french fries + truffle = smiling faces. 

Our table ordered: 
Starters- 
Oysters (in a half shell)- east coast style. They ask you if you want them east coast or west coast style. The difference? east coast are ""larger and briny-er"", west coast are ""smaller and sweeter"" according to our server. 
The oysters were delicious! They had came with cocktail sauce, lemon, and other toppings. The cocktail sauce had some nice horseradish in it for the perfect combination. 

Wedge Salad- bleu cheese, bacon & polenta croutons, red chili cucumbers. I was told that it was disappointing as the bleu cheese dressing didn't have any bleu cheese chucks and tasted ""like it came out of the store"" 

Main- 
18 oz. Dry-Aged Bone-In Rib Eye- heard it was delicious. They cook the steaks on this beautiful open flame wood burning grill. You can watch the chefs using the wheel up and down to get the steaks. Heard that the marble was good and had great char on the steak. Nothing fancy just cooked perfect (medium-rare plus) 

16 oz. Kansas City Strip- great char, great flavor, all round good steak. 

Diver Scallops- which is what I ordered. Four deliciously tender, cooked perfectly, great flavored scallops. Seared nicely. 

Sides- 
Creamed Spinach w/ bacon- I LOVE creamed spinach and this was up to par, but nothing crazy. The bacon doesn't really add anything to the dish. 

Roasted Maitake Mushrooms- great roasted mushrooms. Not much else to say. They are always a good side to seafood and steaks. 

We had a couple of glasses of wine (a cab-combination) that was REALLY GOOD and I would order all day long!

We shared a tiramisu for dessert which was less appetizing. They used madelines soaked in espresso however we found that the madelines were actually frozen not fresh and they hadn't been fully defrosted prior to being served to us. It was disappointing to say the least.

SA0F1qRq-vVhtZLIYFIfTg,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,ibkwcLZwaJ1pnPJVaI_-uA,2,0,0,0,"When I think of Thai food, I think of Swadee. Swadee was sort of my introductory restaurant into the world of Thai food. I've gone with many friends and family her over the years and they all have been satisfied.

So it pains me to write a bad review, but the last couple experiences I've had at Swadee have required me to bid Swadee adieu.

The first bad experience I ordered the Larb Tofu. The dish was so salty I couldn't finish it. It literally tasted like the cap fell off the soy sauce bottle and they dumped  several cups of the stuff in the pan/wok. Even if they didn't, it was pretty much inedible. Inedible in the same way a salad swimming in vinaigrette is.

The second occurred during a visit with my girlfriend. We are both vegetarians and took great care to make sure that the dishes we ordered were meat (and fish sauce, and chicken broth) free. Those ingredients can upset a vegetarian's stomach if it's been a while since they ate meat (or if they've never eaten it). 

Well, my girlfriend ordered the pad thai (carefully made veg) and she found a piece of chicken in her dish. To most this would not be a big deal, but to us chicken isn't considered food and it taints the food it was cooked with. As a result she lost her appetite and it made me feel uneasy about what might be in my own meal. Our lovely Valentine's Day dinner came to a screeching halt.

And as a side note they have a dish with oyster sauce listed on their vegetarian menu. Since when is an oyster a vegetable? The only vegetarian oyster is an oyster mushroom!

I understand that there is always a risk for cross contamination and I expect it when I dine out. But this occurance is far more than just cross contamination. I mean, this thing was a pretty decent sized chunk of bird. It makes me feel uneasy about the level of cross contamination that takes place in Swadee's kitchen. 

The staff was kind enough to comp the tainted Pad Thai (which accounts for the ** instead of *) but I don't believe you'll see me walking into Swadee any time in the foreseeable future.",2011-02-15 19:52:40

Octopus a la plancha appetizer was prepared differently due to seasonal change in the menu. We had it roasted with white beans and chorizo. I love octopus! Not crazy about the beans (in general)but the Chorizo was perfect to add a little kick.

It's very small inside so make a reservation and prepare to be cozy with the neighbors.

The menu is small (not a bad thing in my opinion) and there is an extensive drink list. I was somewhat disappointed that they don't offer all of the Mojito flavors like they do at Fuego Bistro. I ordered a regular Mojito and it wasn't that great. 

The food was really, really good. I think for the price (ranging between $9-$11 a plate) the amount of food is perfect. The tacos are rather large and are accompanied by two large sides of rice and beans. The rice was incredible. Our server talked us into the churros ($4) for dessert which were also pretty good, nothing incredible though.

I will definitely be back to try more tacos. I worry about how the restaurant will do in this location since it is dead at night, the restaurant itself was pretty empty on a Friday at 8pm when we went! Maybe they do well with the business lunch crowd?",2011-03-22 21:37:15
lmSQEQhtnqjdhsluVs1wLg,YqbxuF6zFuBtWSaeNyQ74Q,4KdgkV3aidUZVhm-iW2Dnw,1,18,1,1,"I know most of the reviews are about the ads (nauseam) but we actually had experience with their in-home estimate that we wanted to share. We wanted to match our tile in the living area and replace carpet which is part of the flowy floor plan. We made an appointment, expecting to get a quote. 

Yes they wanted to have ""all parties"" present before they would even show. Big pain, since both DH and I had to rush back from work to meet the ""design consultant"". But I can see why it is important, since they bring all the samples to you they wouldn't want one spouse vetoing the other after decision-making or having to do iterate this process many times. The design consultant was very nice, no doubt. 

Based on our description on phone while making the appointment, he had brought 5-6 tiles which were close but none was a good match. He said since the tile we already had was 8 years old, matching them was not possible as most likely the manufacturer had stopped producing those. No more options, no checking to see if they could match better. Design Consultant in name only, no design options offered. 

So we picked what we thought was close enough to the existing tile, thinking we'd have some time to think about our options, but the consultant wanted our decision immediately. Yes, about relaying our tile, in 15 min. He just went on and on. We doubtfully okayed a negotiated, yet inflated price despite two ""coupons"" - Express Flooring bombards TV viewers with their ads, clearly they must be the biggest showroom for tile and if they cannot match the tile, who can?

Next day, since we had already made an appointment with another company, we had him come over anyway. This person didn't bring any samples, which mistakenly led us to think maybe the Express Flooring people were more professional. The guy, who also seemed doubtful about matching the tile, gave us some design options like tile rugs and wood-look tiles that would set out the room in case we couldn't match the tile yet wanted hard flooring.  And his quote was several hundreds less than Express's. That same day we canceled the Express Flooring order. The consultant called back to tell us that his manager had approved a further $200 reduction on top of our ""discounted price""... we said it was not an issue of cost but of the right tile, which of course came at a better price elsewhere. I should also point out that this person tracked down the manufacturer of the discontinued tile through a supplier and able to buy us a small lot shipped in from California at no extra charge. THAT now is tile design consultation! 

Then began a long cat and mouse game for refund of the money ($1700). While our cards were charged in less than 24 hrs, they said refund processing would take 20 days (yeah, right!) But 25 days later, they hadn't even sent us the order cancellation details by email or mail. Of course, no money in sight. We had to call our credit card company and dispute the charge. It's always funny when a financial institution seems friendlier in a situation than the merchant. 

Suggest you try an ethical flooring company that has local roots. They go out of the way to get your business and it can be win-win for everyone. Hard flooring is a big commitment in terms of time and money - we don't want to be pressured into 15 min decisions.",2012-07-18 19:58:06

Pepper Wok has been here for a long time, but it's located in a plaza where I tend to overlook since there aren't a lot of restaurants that attract me for dinner. After accidentally wandering into this plaza, I took a look at restaurant options available and decided on Pepper Wok.

The place is quite small and the interior looks very dated, but it seems to be good for the demand it gets. The menu also looked like it hasn't been updated in years, and reading the reviews here looks to affirm my claim.

I ordered the Emmentaler Sausages and Pork Chop on Spaghetti, as not many HK style cafe places offer German sausages. It came with a drink and a Chinese-style starter soup. The iced lemon tea was quite good, and the starter soup was okay as well.

As for my main course, I have to say the sausages were better than I thought..they were at least the large and juicy kind. For $8.99 I honestly didn't expect much, but I actually enjoyed my food overall. The pork chop wasn't the best I've had, but I've definitely had worse out there.

Service is as good as it gets, considering there's only a single lady taking orders, pouring tea/water, making drinks, AND doing the cashier. They could hire one more, but the size of the restaurant definitely limits that.

If you're looking for an extremely low cost meal without the eye candy, Pepper Wok is a good option for the area.",2016-01-30 22:17:51

I should have known, but I was drawn by what I thought was an awesome coupon deal. You know how you order delivery, and the food smells good? That's not the case here. It reeked of onions.

The pizza was undercooked and bare. I had the Supreme which was overloaded with diced raw onions and barely had any other toppings. Also, I never thought anyone could screw up Buffalo wings. It's just fried wings with buffalo sauce, but they couldn't even do that. The wings looked unsauced and when I asked the driver about it, he was confident that the sauce was there. After a closer inspection I understood, and it was right then and there that I realized their idea of buffalo sauce is lightly dyed grease. Besides a very faint smidge of color in the grease, there was no hint of buffalo at all. The wings were really old, as if they were reheated and chilled several times. That was most likely the case. I tossed them away fearing food poisoning in my near future.

I am hoping I can stomach the rest of my pizza after reheating it myself. I wish I could get a refund, but I don't want to put up a fight just to hear that they won't provide one.

The lines were much improved compared to their soft opening days but they still ran out of eggs ! (well for the tempura anyway... at least I still got one in my nabeyaki at least)

This event was to promote a few of their new items

Nabeyaki Udon - Hot udon noodle soup cooked and served in individual iron pot. Special kake based soup filled with seasoned beef, mushrooms, and cabbage topped with fishcake, shrimp tempura, and a Japanese poached egg. 

Miso Sesame Pork over Rice - Sauce made from blend of 6 difference sauces and 2 types of chilis

Garlic Chicken Udon Salad - Iceberg Lettuce Salad Mix, Cucumbers, Radish, Cherry Tomatoes on a bed of freshly made udon topped w/ special seasoned fried chicken karaage served with a sweet soy garlic dressing

Mentaiko Ochazuke Rice - Pour salted dashi broth over a bed of white rice and fragrant crispy rice topped with Mentaiko on a bed of scallions

Shabu Shabu Udon Salad - Fresh Spring Salad Mix and bell peppers on a bed of freshly made udon topped with thin sliced pork belly, cherry tomatoes, and served with a sweet miso sesame dressing

Of course we had to try the new Nabeyaki Udon, and I've always wanted to try ochazuke rice bowls. 

The nabeyaki udon serving is really big. I'm not sure if it was because I was currently going through a bout of a stomach bug (most likely cuz I know im more of a piggy than this normally...) Lots of veggies. Only complaint was the broth was a bit sweet. I don't know if their ""special kake based soup"" is originally sweet but I know the beef is cooked in a sweet base too. Questioned if it was my appetite but others agreed to the sweetness as well. I still wonder if I can request the udon to be cooked less. I keep forgetting about this until I eat the udon. Lol The poached egg was yummy. Super silky and creamy yolk. 

Mentaiko Ochazuke Rice... wait I was supposed to get salted dashi broth? o well. I over ordered anyway and couldn't even eat this, nor the mentai onigiri I had gotten as well. LOL sad face. I ended up moving the mentai over to the mentai cream pasta which was shared between the few of us. 

The mentai onigiri (which I ate the next morning) was fairly decent. The mentai is actually more spread throughout the onigiri than ones I've had in the past at other places which gives more of a spread mentai experience vs all in the middle. pretty good :]",2018-04-04 19:07:24

The presentation of the food left something to be desired, but then again, so did the taste. We got pretty small plates (perhaps because I let it slip that we had a coupon?) The vegetarian poblano pepper entree ($18 mind you) had only one half of a stuffed pepper, over plain white rice, and was covered with a cheese sauce that was Velveeta-esque. There were no subtle nuances of flavors, just a bit of creamy slop with boiled tomato bits floating in the cheesy sea of regret. The corn bread that came with the meal was clearly microwaved and was 2""x 2""-- a sad display.

One of the staff was always with us. He explained all the rules and also acted as a referee during our dodgeball games. He was nice and friendly. 

Honestly, I did not realize how tiring trampolining is until I stepped onto the trampoline, and then adding dodgeball to that intensifies the amount of energy you need in order to play...for a whole hour.

But what I didn't like was the service as the waitress seemed a bit rude. When we first sat down she had heard us saying we wanted the Chicken Pakora & asked us if we wanted to order it now as it took 20 mins to prepare. However, we were still waiting for two others to arrive & didn't want to order anything yet. Then she kept coming back (2x?) to ask about the order. It was the attitude that was questionable. i remember the bill being dropped on the table, no smiles, looked pissed.... 

From memory, we had...
Asian Garden Special Hakka Chow Mien - the photo in the menu looked better but still tasty.
Chili Chicken - tasty and a little spicy. i liked this more than the chicken pakora
Chicken Pakora - great w/ a little sauce
Shrimp Friend Rice - great for those who don't enjoy spicy foods. yum yum 
Beef Fried Rice - this was prob. my fav. there was a bit of spice in there and it really gave it a little kick
some other veggie dish

It only cost about $10 per person (for 6 ppl). What a great price !

She didn't say anything to us. Then a second woman came out of nowhere and said 'You can go over there' pointing to the general area the first woman was now standing.  It was really weird. I've become accustomed to being greeted, being asked how many people are in our party, and also being asked if we need a high chair or booster chair. But okay, I guess we'll skip all that and go directly to sitting and my almost 4 year old is apparently sitting in a high chair again.
Lunas was half filled with senior citizens and half empty. The TV's in the corners had the news on. And senior pricing and specials we're plentiful.  Luna's definitely caters to the areas seniors. But the value isn't just for AARP cardholders - The whole menu is priced very reasonably.
Today I got the Westsider. It's sliced meatloaf with gravy atop a piece of bread. It was served with a side of steamed veggies, a bowl of soup, and a scoop of mashed potatos. Delicious! The food here always reminds me of the stuff my mom used to make. Their corned beef is really good too.

Bandera altho a chain and part of the Houston's brand is one of those chains that I will frequent because they are worth it.

For some odd reason I like my 3s and if I were to recommend 3 items on their menu ok wait 4... but the main 3 are the Green Chile Cornbread Skillet, the Bandera Cheeseburger and the Roast Chicken. These menu items are foods that must be tried because they're good. The cornbread skillet is crumbly, moist, and simply good. It easily serves at least 3 people but the center comes out drier so ask for some extra butter in order to moisten it a little bit. The Roast Chicken is half a chicken and served with green rice (the fourth recommended item) which is divine. The Roasted Chicken is moist, and the flavors of the chicken is scrumptious. And last, the Bandera Cheeseburger which must be cooked medium but it's not served on the usual two buns, not it's like a long bun split in 3, so it comes out like large sized sliders. Along with the shoestring fries and that my foodsters is one of the best cheeseburgers on the old town drag. LOVE it! Bandera's is perfect for date nights, friend night outs, and family dinners.

It all started when I won tickets to a screening of Last Jedi from my bank. It happened to be booked for the theatre at the South Point so I came in from work and prepared to get my nerd on. I had some time to kill before the show so I walked around the casino looking for food. The National Finals Rodeo was in town and the South Point was the place to be for all the cowboys. With all those cowboys over running the casino, most every dining option was packed. But not Zenshin. There were pleanty of open tables and no line. Plus they have happy hour specials from 2:00 to 6:00 PM daily and it was now only 5:00. Since I was a party of one, I was seated immediately at the bar. 

I already knew what I wanted to order having looked through the menu outside. I asked for a Sapporo beer ($4.50) and an order of the chicken lettuce wraps ($5.00). My beer was up within a couple of minutes and was simply a nicely poured lager. Refreshing but nothing spectacular. My lettuce wraps came out just a couple of minutes after the beer. There were three pieces of bib lettuce on the plate each with its own small fill of ground chicken and mushrooms. I could smell the mushrooms above all else. Fine by me as a mushroom fanatic. There was also a small bowl of thick sauce which I spooned over the chicken. Each wrap lasted about three bites.  Not huge portions but it was just an appetizer. Despite the small size they had big flavor. A punch of salt from the sauce. Earthiness from the mushrooms. A hint of spice. It was perfect to get me through the movie. 

At $5 for this app, I am not upset. But I would never pay full price for it, whatever full price is. And the beer at $4.50 was high too. Especially for a happy hour pint. Though I guess it was technically an import. All in all, the beer was cold and the food hot. Service was friendly and the cowboys were not (just kidding guys). And everything came to my table fast. 

Historically I don't really come to the South Point more than once a decade so I probably wont be stopping back by Zenshin. If by chance I should I find myself back here, I'd be happy to give it another go.",2017-12-16 23:19:10

Okay so I've been here several times over a span of years. Been to other Thomas Keller spots- other Bouchons, French Laundry,etc. and I am such a big fan of that man. I hope he's there when I dine so I can try to shake that man's hand. 

With that said, I still review it with the food in mind. I'm more critical of chefs I like actually and he lives up to what I enjoy. 

I'm a freak about pates, mention this in every spot that offers it and I can always be bought out happily with that, but it's the other stuff that brings me back.

Everything else was exceptional.

Appetizer- I love the pork belly sausage with anise.This was a wonderful sausage and I really like the dates and vinegrette pair with it.

Main- I've had a leg of lamb with beans dish and a duck breast au poivre and both were executed nicely and cooked right.

Dessert- Caramel Creme and Pot De Creme. Simple and hits the comfort food part of my soul. 

I mostly come here for brunch.

Love the Croque Madame, quiches have been flaky and flavorful, and the mussels served with fries are wonderfully  fresh mussels with a nice saffron wine sauce. The whole thing about his fries being the best- these are good fries but its debatable if its the best...on the other side of the casino is Pinot Brasserie and I favor their fries more. To each their own- there is no ""best"" out there but the ""best"" to each our taste. Chicken and waffles were good but its not FRIED chicken which I looooveee...separate elements each are yum, but together I can't get past roasted chicken...but the chive and bacon waffle is awesome! . 

I have no complaints about service. It is decent and hasn't slipped up much. Still it's not the best and the Bouchon Beverly Hills staff is a lot more friendly and attentive to me....and the Napa Bouchon is the friendliest of the Bouchons. 

This is a recommended spot when people ask me about where to brunch on the strip. I support it by being a Keller fan, I stand by it because it's solid.",2010-03-16 03:02:31

Wow, a bar in Scottsdale that's friendly, laid back and inviting in such a way that you never want to leave. In fact, you want to keep ordering drinks while you claim a table near the fireplace and dart board. Yes, when I got to TT Roadhouse, I didn't know what to expect. When I walked in, I saw Christmas lights, wooden benches and people gathered around the bar. These people were ""real"" people with tats, facial hair, unkempt hair. Some were even a bit dingy in appearance. Charming, if you ask me. I felt immediately comfortable, like I didn't have to worry about being anything but myself. I took a good look around and saw that the people here with me probably felt the same way - hence why they were there that night. 

Fact of the matter is, I didn't want to leave. But, considering I didn't drive, I had no choice. Yet, if I had gotten my way, I would have stayed here longer. In fact, I probably would have skipped the previous two bars and made a bee-line for TT's. I mean, this place is the closest I've come to discovering a small, cool and relaxed bar in Scottsdale. (Reminds me of neighborhood bars you'll find in Chicago.)

You won't find fake blondes here, unless they're platinum blonde with plugs and mary janes. No, I don't mean to sound stereotypical. I just like how you can walk into this bar and ""fit in."" It doesn't matter if your shirt's the only clean-smelling one you could find in your dirty hamper or if it's the brand new one you found at your fave retailer. Whatever. S'all good here. 

Even better, the bartender! C'mon now. There's something romantically bizarre about a super tall man with dred locks behind the bar, overseeing the entire establishment as if he were also the security dawg. He had a ""tough guy"" persona. I bet, though, he's one cool mofo. In fact, he reminded me of my fave House DJ, Donald Glaude. Perhaps that's why I immediately liked him. He had that air about him, like he'd be one of the funniest people you'd ever meet. He was also quick to notice me when I went up to place my order. Earlier in the night, when my fave bar comrad and myself went to order a round for ourselves and our friends, we said, ""One snakebite."" Then we began to have a quick-paced convo with Bartender Glaude about what was in that mix. ""Isn't it Cider?"" ""No, I think it's Bass."" ""No, maybe it's Bass and Cider."" Ah, classic! 

One thing I did notice, though, was that when we walked in, there was no music playing. It took a good 10 minutes for anything to come on. That was a bit off-putting. But, once the tunes started, I settled into the booth by the fireplace and enjoyed my Black Velvet and a game of friendly darts.",2007-12-17 17:01:40

One mark of authenticity is everyone who works there speaks Chinese.  To my delight, they carry quite a few Taiwanese small dishes.  

The BEEF NOODLE SOUP with thin noodles---so good!  The beef shank was oh so tender.  I think I ate the bowl dry.  The PORK SLIDER had a bit too much dough for my liking but it is probably the closest I'm going to come to my beloved gua bao of Taipei without having to fly overseas.  I've also had the SOUP DUMPLINGS and they are tasty but not the best thing on the menu for me.

Lo and behold, what do they put in? A Mexican market! 

I'd like to say my random thoughts had something to do with this place being built here...but they didn't.

Either way, it should do well here if they can keep it clean and well managed. It is pretty typical as far as these markets go, and as such, the meat counter stretches for a mile, stocked with everything from chicken feet and tripe to carne and pollo asada and all meat pieces and parts in between. 
Pick a number and be prepared to yell your order when called, it is busy and noisy.
They had what seemed like 2 different kinds of music playing over the loudspeaker - a club type dance beat drone and a more Mexican style salsa. Kind of annoying.

They do have the tortilleria here, producing some fine, fresh, mostly corn tortillas. A sit in food area - we didn't eat here but I will at some point (review to come)

The bakery was awesome, we picked up some rolls that were fantastic, not to mention cheap. Lots of brightly colored cookies I would never eat and more typical looking donuts. All baked fresh.

We arrived around 10:00 on a Tuesday night, and the place was pretty much empty.  We were the lone non-Ethiopians in the joint.

The surroundings were nice, but relatively spartan.  Our server, who obviously saw that we were clueless, was very nice and offered suggestions on what to order.  We went with lamb tibs and a beef dish of some sort.

OK.  Things are going well so far.  I'm drinking my beer, life is good.

The beef entree arrives on a big, metal plate.  There's also a basket with five or six napkins in it.  The food is sitting on this big pancake-looking thing.  No silverware to be found.  WTF????  Where's my freaking fork???

The server, sensing our confusion, unrolled one of the napkins to reveal not a napkin, but another one of those pancake thingys.  Holy crap!   I get it, you rip off part of the napkin (which has a very strange texture, like a sponge), to scoop up the delicious morsels sitting on the pancake.

OK, that's funny.  I'm a fucking yokel from North Dakota.  TEE HEE HEE. 

You can stop laughing now.  Really.  I'm a rube, we get it.

OK...the food was delicious.  A bit spicy, but in a good way.  The lamb tibs were a bit charred and had lots o' gristle, but were very flavorful and had a nice sauce to accompany them.  Very nice.

Service was at a leisurely pace, and the server was very nice and attentive.  The tab was about $30, and I had three beers.  CHEAP AS HELL!

I asked the server what the bread was made of, she said sunflowers, but I didn't buy it.  I subsequently learned the bread is injera, which is made out of a grain called teff.  Who knew?  I ain't never seen none of them there teff farmers out here in NoDak, no sireee!!!!  Wheat?  Check.  Barley?  Check.  Flax?  Check.  Teff?  Um, Nope.

I'm looking forward to hitting an Ethiopian restaurant on my next trip to the big city (Mpls/St.Paul, Denver, etc...) and would return here on my next visit to LV.

I've seen tons of musicals, but Porgy and Bess was not one of them.  I was familiar with many of the songs (for example, Summer Time, It Ain't Necessarily So) but was not that familiar with the plot.  I did know it was more operatic then most Broadway shows that are shown at the Benedum, but it is always excited to experience something new.

After grabbing my sippy cup of wine, we took our seats.  The seats were great!  We were left of center towards the back of the Orchestra.  This further confirms to me that there really aren't many bad seats at the Benedum.

For some reason, there was a delay in starting the show.  I usher at the Benedum, so I know it had something to do with the production company and not the theater.  Knowing the show was about two and a half hours long, I was itching for it to start on time.  However, once the 25 piece orchestra played the opening chords of the overture, I knew we would be in for a treat.  Most modern musicals have ditched the overture and entr'acte, so it was enjoyable to hear both as a part of this production.  

Once the curtain rose, we were greeted with a minimalist set and a slightly inclined stage.  It made me think of how many opera houses ""back in the day"" had an inclined stage because they did not have inclined seating.  Although the set was minimal, it was impactful.  This was achieved through creative staging and choreography.  Even the fights (which can end up being quite cheesy in stage shows) were done tastefully and made as believable as possible.

The numbers in this show drew you in either through catchy tunes or for the emotional attachment.  I found myself wanting to dance along with the picnickers in ""Oh, I Can't Sit Down"" and feeling the raw emotion of the characters in ""My Man's Gone Now"" and ""I Loves You Porgy.""  Some of my favorites were ""It Ain't Necessarily So"" ""Leaving for the Promised Land"" and ""Oh Doctor Jesus.""  However, they were all enjoyable and well executed.  Sometimes when things are done in an operatic style it can be difficult to understand a performer, especially when using a specific dialect.  That was not the case in this production.  Everything was sung and spoken clearly which made it easier for the audience to follow along with the plot.

The show had a great mix of solos and ensemble numbers, humor and sadness and it flowed very well from one song to the other. Overall, a very enjoyable experience and a great night out!  I highly recommend seeing this show during its run in Pittsburgh.",2014-02-26 18:46:12

- Currywvrst style Boerewors ($6)

- Large order of duck fat fries (maple/rosemary and garlic chive dips) ($6.50)
- Cherry soda

The currywvrst was really just one sausage sliced, with curry flavor tomato sauce on top and came with one piece of bread on the side.  I didn't know what to do with the bread, so I folded it in half and made a little sausage sammy with it.

The kangaroo sausage was more impressive...the bun was large, soft and fresh tasting.  It was stuffed with the onions and saurkraut leaving no room for condiments, not that it needed it.

The large order of duck fat fries was almost too big for two people, albeit very delicious.  I would consider getting the small portion next time.  The garlic chive dip was by far better than the maple rosemary.  I just didn't care for that combination.

There are some very interesting, thought-provoking pieces here, but the space is quite small. Altogether, there are about 30 works of art.

The audio guide contains some interesting backstories. For example, one of the portraits on display depicts Picasso's ex-girlfriend. Apparently, Picasso continued to frequently visit his ex and painted this portrait WHILE he was dating someone else. Pablo, that is pretty messed up. You got some serious cojones...

So in the end, was it worth it? Well, because it was free, the line was long and unfortunately moved VERY slowly. We waited about an hour to get in. We agreed that it would've been worth it to pay for admission just to skip the long wait. However, if there was no line, as in pretty much every other day, we're not sure it is worth the price of admission, even at the reduced locals rates. The exhibit is worth seeing, but perhaps I've just been spoiled from being able to see an ENTIRE museum full of art for about twice the price. Even the venerable and fantastic Art Institute of Chicago has free evenings on a regular basis.",2010-10-10 01:27:31

First off, this place takes care!!!  The food that they serve is definitely a reflection of the quality of produce and products used!  This is an important element that differentiates their food from surrounding competitors, and it's a difference you can really taste.  Moreover, the food here is extremely affordable and definitely worth the price mark, add ons and all!

I'm always open to new food but when trying a new Greek restaurant I always take it back to basics.  Hummus and tzatzki with pita bread are ALWAYS a must for me so I was delighted with the fact that I had found a place who knew what they were doing.  The texture and seasoning was on point and I love the accompanying pita bread!!  It was thin, soft, warm and didn't overpower any of the dipping sauces.  In other words, it was not overly thick and hard.  

Do try a little combo of the different appetizers such as the hummus, tzatzki, dolmades, pita bread!!  It's a wonderful selection of the most popular Greek comforts.  Those little dolmades were fresh, flavorful and stuffed just right.  Please... Do yourself a favor and get an order of the Great Greek feta fries. Damn!! This dish really won me over cause i'm a sucker for fries and this little twist was such a nice palate pleaser! Amazing!!  Can't stop thinking about them!  Gyros are tricky ordering for me because others i've tried either had too much of something, or too little.  The Great Greek's gyro was huge and each ingredient it was stuffed with did not outshine another; it was the perfect amount of everything.  Presentation is simple and to the point but also exhibits a hidden wow factor that I like.  

The restaurant itself is extremely inviting and exudes a very ""my house is your house"" type of feeling!  Being that it is a family affair, there are no inconsistencies when it comes to service!!!  This is what I love about gems like these... It doesn't have that ""chain restaurant"" feeling... and that brings me back to the not so secret ingredient: love, love, love!!!  You can tell that you matter as soon as you step in cause you're always greeted with a smile and a welcoming hello!

Anyway... Go ahead and give The Great Greek a try for yourself.  You'll see just what I'm talking about once you take your first bite.  I highly recommend! *love*",2011-09-28 00:06:46

The fish and chips called to me, like the Sirens singing their song. What arrived on my plate made my heart join in the chorus!! Two chubby haddock filets fried to perfection, surrounded by a halo of fries cut in-house. 

The fish was moist, tender and flaky...best I've had since the last time I was in Halifax! I'm not sure what went into their batter, but it sure kept the grease out and the flavor in. So crunchy and tasty, but without being overly hard or brittle like some batters get when fried. This was perfection.

I must say this was the first time in my life I've ever finished the fries first though...and wished there were more. (These were no ordinary fries - I swear they had magical powers and flew off my plate.) Usually you get a heap of uninteresting, pedestrian fries that you could take or leave.

Here are some things you should know:

The Strip District location is cash only, but there is a newer Robinson location that takes credit cards. There are several ATM's close by ion the Strip in case you forget.

You can make reservations 24 hours in advance for parties of 6 or more. It's a great idea, especially given the lines that often go outside the door.

Deluca's is not for everybody, it's classic diner with a great reputation and they are reluctant to change. But the food is good and it's a perennial favorite and a source of pride for many Pittsburghers.

There is a hustle and bustle to Deluca's.  It's people on their way to a game, or on their way to shop in the Strip. There's a kind of excitement here which you may not find relaxing, but it's part of Pittsburgh tradition and worth experiencing.

There some unusual ethnic dishes which are quite good, for example, a Greek omelet with Feta cheese and Spinach. Pierogies.

The decor is dated, literally hasn't changed in 30 years but neither has the food.  I can count on it always being  consistently good. Service is always top notch. Chips are fresh, thin and crispy. Salsa made fresh, but sometimes its mild, sometimes medium, sometimes hot! 

Fajitas are sold by either the half or whole pound. Half pound can easily feed 2-3 people. Half pound of cadillac, beef tenderloin fajitas is $21. $40 for 3 nonalcoholic beverages, 1 kids meals, a side of refried beans and a side of guac. Not bad for a weekend dinner for 3, with leftovers!

 Tortillas pressed and made on premise in a  glass enclosed work station. Be prepared they aren't the average thin flour tortillas. They are thick but that means you can overload on the fillings.

We were greeted quickly and set to our seats. Service is fast. Large selection of dishes, rolls, desserts and drinks to choose from! I was surprised because most, if not all AYCE sushi places don't have this option for pop otherwise you're just given water/tea. You also get %10 off if you pay with cash, how can you resist this place?! I'm in love. This may be weird but for the salad lovers, I always get a small salad and the dressing at other places is either too watery or too thick and strong. The sauce here is perfect! The rice to fillings are perfect ratio. I love their enoki rolls, sashimi was fresh and sliced to a generous amount. Their battered and fried dishes came out HOT! I can go on and on and on..

Potbelly has finally opened in Chandler!  ""Yippee Ki Yay"", (you know the rest). LOL

Nearly five years ago, I wrote a Yelp Review about their new Scottsdale location ""that Potbelly's makes a tasty little sandwich for $4.80, and an even better one for $5.00. (Now, $5.85)

""Potbelly is a yummy Midwest sandwich place, that is known primarily for their Wreck sub.  It's made with salami, roast beef, turkey and ham along with swiss cheese. 

""They also have two similar subs called:  ""Italian"" with Capicola, Mortadella, Pepperoni, Salami with Provolone cheese, and a ""Pizza Sandwich"" which has many of the same cuts of deli meat, but comes with marinara sauce.""

Okay, my Midwest bias aside, Potbelly's is familiar in many ways to other sandwich/sub places, yet very different. In the beginning, they had local musicians playing in their shoppes. 

I believe that feature is gone now. But their pressed tin ceilings, potbelly stove (Really? In Arizona?) and all of the eccentric posters and pictures, make it a fun trip

I started a small argument in my office today, when I mentioned this location was open. Seemed everyone had their own idea on what make Potbelly special. The consensus was, the Wreck and their Shakes. Go figure. 

So my Sitrep is that Potbelly combines a very well made, tasty Parisian bread, that is lightly toasted with premium cold cuts. Then throw in some spicy Giardiniera (Chicago style hot peppers), some condiments, rabbit food, etc and Bingo - you have a Potbelly sub. 

Btw, Potbelly's comes in two sizes, Regular - about 6 1/2"" and Bigs, which I taped measured at 10"". See photo.

Vosges Haut-Chocolat only has boutiques in Chicago, New York and our lovely town, but who wants to deal with the weather and traffic of either of those beastly cities. The only bad thing about this boutique is that it is a bit of a challenge to find given that it is on the lower level of the Forum Shops addition, which means you are a victim to the crazy architecture that forces you to walk in big circles and then wonder how the heck you escape.

I could be mistaken, but I do not think that the boutique offers coffee, tea or ice cream, although I do know that Vosges has ice cream. However, that is not important really. I ended up at Vosges as I was in search of a hot drink to gift to a brother-in-law over the holiday season, and I thought that fancy hot chocolate might be a good idea. 

There are generous samples at the store, enough reason to stop by if you are out shopping, and the clerks are super nice without being pushy at all. I guess it is easy to be happy working in a chocolate shop.

Back to the hot chocolate, I arrived at the store, and my sidekick was a bit overwhelmed by the price of $15 for some glorified Swiss Miss. The clerks told us it was not hot chocolate; it was drinking chocolate, but that just seemed like fancy semantics. My sidekick and I argued about the investment, and then we realized that there is actually a cafe component to the store, which meant we could actually purchase a cup of this ""drinking chocolate"". $5 later we were sold. If you have not experienced drinking chocolate, add it to your list of musts. The experience is pretty much captured in the moniker: drinking chocolate. We opted for the most traditional flavor, but they do have white chocolate and another concoction. 

So, my 5 stars are given for the cafe component, but judging from the rest of the reviews, everything else is amazing as well. If you are on a chocolate tour of Las Vegas, add this to your stop right after you slurp down a frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity 3.",2010-01-09 19:23:43

My chicken and waffle was good! Not great but good. The waffle was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The single piece of crispy fried chicken was tasty with a mild spice that went well
With the syrup. 

I sampled the poutine and it was decent but I'm not a huge poutine fan to begin with. Not sure I would go back between the hours of 10:30-1 pm. The people who got their before 11  am were still waiting for their food!

Something needs to change. The $25 brunch + tax and tip isn't worth the wait unless you're purposefully fasting until noon. Ha.",2017-08-30 07:42:54

They bake their own baguettes, which is the reason why the place always smells so delish. I always order #11, which is the most authentic Vietnamese sandwich. It includes mayonnaise, pate, variety of cold cuts. I've taken people here and they all love #11.
And above all, this place is absolutely CLEAN! This is rare in lots of asian restaurants (unfortunately).
I give this place 4.5 because most of the times the baguettes get pretty hard. I've had it when the baguette was fresh, just came out and it was melt-in-your-mouth kind of crunchy.
I would come here any time of the day, any day of the week!

The lunch menu is quite extensive with entree, noodles, dim sum and more. We ordered a few items to share so we can have a taste of what they offers before we come back for dinner.

蒙古羊肉面 ($7.99) Mongolian Lamb Noodle Soup - tasted homemade in a bad way
小籠包 ($4.50) Steamed Soup Dumpling - doughy and heavy
Veggie Pancake ($2.50) - hardly have any filling
豆沙鍋餅 ($2.50) Red Bean Pancake 

I found most of the dish we ordered were mediocre at best.

The set up is like the other Vietnamese owned Cajun restaurants where the seafood is steamed then doused in the sauce of your choice and served in plastic bags tied at the top so the flavors of the sauce steams into the seafood. 
My girlfriends and I shared bags of crawfish, shrimp and crab legs in the Flamin special sauce. I loved It! The sauce is very strong and kind of takes away from the seafood's natural flavor but I like It that way. There's a sweetness in the sauce and a very subtle flavor reminiscent of Thai coconut curry. It was so delicious! I ordered Cajun fries just so I'd have something to dip in the sauce - it's that good! 
There are heat levels you can choose ranging from mild to hot. Being Asian, I love spicy heat and throw Thai bird chilies in pretty much every dish I eat. I even have a jar of my mom's home dried and ground Thai bird chilis in my office drawer to add to food while I'm at work. Eating so much peppers so frequently, I like to think I can hang when It comes to spicy peppers. Which is why I ordered hot. 
Most places don't have heat levels high enough for me to feel the burn and Vietnamese food isn't really spicy - or at least not as spicy as Thai and Korean dishes. 
Boy was I wrong! It's so spicy that my cheeks were a vibrant shade of red, my fingers were sore and I was literally crying tears of heat at the table. I loved It!!! Like I seriously felt euphoric eating the seafood. 
I'm giving only 4 stars because as great as the seafood was, the drinks were not good at all. I ordered mango tea with boba and ended up throwing It away. It wasn't sweet and there's a bad kind of bitter aftertaste you get when tea has been steeped too long. 
The next time I go, I'll only eat the seafood and save my money for the teas at Tea Fusion instead.",2017-11-19 03:30:21

Have been here for dinner or lunch several times, and just tried out the new lunch buffet.  As others have noted-- the regular menu is all over the map, which is frightening, but I've just stuck with the Sri Lankan curries which are good (but a bit on the salty side).  They also have quesadillas, so it checks the box for being a place that my pickier kid will eat at without too much protest.

The lunch buffet however was a surprise!  While I am not an expert on Sri Lankan food, there was a great variety (more than is on the regular menu) and it was actually appropriately SPICEY, unlike your typical Indian buffet.  They also had a couple of desserts-- again, different from Indian, but similar in that the overwhelming characteristic was sweet (which I actually like).  Our server said that they switch the dishes Fri/Sat/Sun from the rest of the week.  Lunch Buffet was a bargain @ $9.99, and I think weekends are $12.99.

For starters we get there and go to ask for a table and get wait time and the head of the house says it's like 20-30 min wait you sure you want to wait and we said yes that's fine and he goes ok and walks off shaking his head.  We were a little caught by surprise as that's not very professional but whatever he wasn't the cook.  So we sit down and wait and notice he is trying to get people to not wait and leave every single party that came up asking for a table as a matter of fact.  Many of us waiting have started to laugh at how horrible this guy is.  He even went as far as saying ya it's over a 30 min. wait so I wouldn't wait if I were you.  OMG really??? I hope the owner reads this and does something because if that was my restaurant I would be pissed.  

Anyways on to the meal.  Laura A. and I shared the Tapas sampler which was good it comes with a Tamal Cubano which was excellent, some Chorizo and vegetables, Frituras de Frijoles, Maduros Fritos, Bacalaitos Fritos, and a couple Croquetas.  It was perfect for the two of us to share but there was a lot of fried on the plate which wasn't as much variety as we would hope for.  

We both finished the meal with coffee she got the Café Cubano which was a sweet espresso and I went with the Moro Castle which had Dark rum, Bailey's and butterscotch schnapps combined with Cuban coffee it was a nice way to end the evening and enjoy with dessert which we shared a coconut flan with mango sauce.  The dessert was good not great though I am a huge flan fan and I have had better.  

So overall I would say the meal was a 3.5 but the front of the house being so rude knocked it all the way down to a 2.  Pretty sad after I had given it a 4.5 on my last trip.",2011-02-17 15:55:57

My wife and I live in Observatory Hill and I adore this neighborhood. Right on Riverview Park, quiet, beautiful historic homes, and close to everything. The only thing this neighborhood is lacking, in my opinion, is more restaurants. Sure, there are acceptable dining options 5-10 minutes away in every direction. But some times you just want fast, delicious and convenient. And to not leave the house. Until recently there was only one pizza place that would deliver to our house. One. And it's downright nasty. Right next door to the high school so that's the crowd they cater too. I'm guessing you can set your standards pretty darn low when your only competition is the school cafeteria pizza. 
Then, one glorious day, a menu appeared on our doorstep. Riviera Pizza and Pasta. And they deliver to our home. Worth a try! They have all of the typical offerings, breadsticks, pizza, calzones, hoagies. You know what a pizza place has. What they have that I've never encountered before is a relationship with eat24, an app that allows me to order on my iPad and magically have pizza show up at my house. Whaaaaatt?!?! I can order pizza and never have to speak to another human, and the food will come to me while I'm in my pajamas?!? Finally!! All of my dreams are coming true! It's finally a civilized neighborhood thanks to Riviera!
The food is a solid 3.5 stars. The pizza is pretty good. It's tasty, cheesy, and just the right amount of greasy. The breadsticks are super yummy and we get them every time we order. We like the calzones a lot, the small one is enough for 3 servings at least. The delivery has always been faster than the quoted time and the drivers are kind and courteous.

We go in and are seated and look at the menu. Both of us commented on the odd assortment of items on the Combo. Our first clue was all of the help looked as if they were from the Mid-West. We decided to have the Fajitas and a Combo. They brought out some chips that reminded me of the ones you get at Safeway in the giant bag for a buck or two. Then there was the ""Salsa"". It was basically Catsup, not Ketchup as in Heinz or some other reputable product, but the stuff in the huge container for 99cents, mixed with something like hot sauce. We ordered Cheese Crisps. They were basically corn tortillas with some shredded cheddar cheese melted on top. Then the food came out. Let's just say, having eaten at Ponchos Buffet, there is worse, but places like this are usually found in the Mid-West where the people think Taco Bell is authentic. The only redeeming value to this place was the Ice Tea was tasty, that and the cashier offered to let us buy some candy to make the $40 bill (for two) so we could get the $10 off rather than the $5 off of a $20.

Thought about treating my mechanic and his helper and I thought my husband would like this.  And I know my kids already like this, and they were starting to eat solid food again from being sick the past week.

Ordered 3 grilled pork Banh Mi's, 2 grilled chicken and a roast beef croissant sandwich and 2 orders of 5 pork & shrimp egg rolls.  There was nobody ordering at the time we ordered and the lull of any lunch rush was over.

The Banh Mi's were very reasonably priced at $3.49 and it's quite a lot for a sandwich.  The egg rolls, I thought, were a little pricey at $3.99 for 5 Vietnamese style egg rolls (deep fried), but the sandwich price made up for this.  I can't remember how much the small croissant sandwich was, but I think that was close to $5 and it wasn't very big.

So the deal is to get a Banh Mi, but my son wasn't up to eating that much and needed something softer.  All that came to about $31-32, which that's food for 6 people's lunches, so not bad.

It took probably 15 minutes to make the order, which the egg rolls were already prepared, so I thought it took a bit more time.  I didn't know that the Banh Mi wrappers indicated what sandwich it was.

The guy that took my order is Latino, which isn't a big deal.  I think the guy making the stuff was Asian.  Oh, and make sure you bring cash.  They do not take credit or debit cards and there is a machine for you to get cash, but there is a $1.75 charge.  I wish they had this as a sign on the front door - CASH ONLY!  

Next time I will know.  That was why I gave it a 4 star, but really, it only deserves a 1/2 star knock down for that, not a full star.  But, since I'm Asian, I should know that some Asian places only do cash.  Okay, heck, I'll give them 5 stars.

We'd go again.  Everyone that I got the sandwiches for liked them.  The baguette was perfect - somewhat toasted on the outside and slightly soft on the inside.  The grilled pork was very tasty and just enough of the veggies, not too much.  Just the right amounts of meat and veggies.

We made reservations, arrived about 15 minutes early. We were told to sit at the bar and wait until the hostess seated us. Well, that is somewhat unreasonable I thought. We are early- however, other fine dinning establishments have seated us when we arrived early or late for the matter. Let me be clear, perhaps I would not have even mentioned our brief stent in musical chairs had not the hostess forgotten about us. When the time was 10 minutes AFTER our reservation, with multiple tables open (even when we arrived 15 minutes early), one is not that eager at this point to try the food. 

For the record, I enjoy mojitos. I was excited to try the blueberry mojito on their drink menu. However, the blueberries (being fresh and out of season) were bitter and one can taste it in the drink. Perhaps the mistake was mine choosing to risk it. Or also theirs for even offering it in the winter.

I will confess, the calamari was absolutely to die for! Lightly breaded, perfectly seasoned, and cooked to perfection. I'm a die hard calamari fan. No greater compliment can I offer. 

My husband's appetizer was the mushroom tart. Eh, I was not so impressed. The pastry was not flaky nor light. The mushrooms were drowning in gravy. In the dishes defense, my husband enjoyed it. However, he also enjoys Giant Eagle sausage. Whose palate do you trust more? The choice is yours.

My entree left me wanting more. Not more of my entree but a properly prepared version of it. I ordered the lamb chops with spinach risotto. I nearly sobbed when I tasted my risotto. It was overcooked and under-seasoned. I took a few bites and hung the proverbial white flag. The lamb chops looked sobbingly. One could see gobs of mustard, and breading thrown about together. The taste was worse than the appearance. To the chef's credit, they were perfectly cooked. I struggle to find anything else positive to say about the entire dish.

My husband was equally unimpressed with his entree. He ordered the beef two-ways. I tasted his brisket and thought it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. However, the pot roast serving size was miniscule. I thought the dish was missing that extra something that would qualify the expensive price tag.

In Savoy's defense, I may not have critiqued this restaurant so harshly if the employees had not spoken so highly of the food before we eat it. Everyone from the bartender, waiter, and bus-man raved about how amazing their food is and that we would keep coming back. Although I applaud their loyalty the food was not the land of milk and honey they promised. If your staff sings psalms of how godly your food is- you better deliver. I have no problem paying for a fine dinning experience. However, this was not that type of experience. In this case, the food was far from what I anticipated and was promised. It left me wanting something more.",2012-01-05 00:17:08

I found a car on Craigslist that they were advertising and through the entire process I was waiting for the typical tactics of a small car dealership.  I was waiting for the salesman (Mark, by the way) to get pushy, for them to bait and switch me on a piece of junk, for hard tactics by the finance manager... etc... I kept waiting and waiting, then before I knew it I had keys in my hand.

They all were extremely professional, swift, educated, courteous.  I cannot say enough good about them.  I actually commented to them as I was leaving that I expected a battle and was pleasantly surprised.

Now... I will say that while I was there I did see a few unhappy customers.  The ones I saw were all a part of their ""buy here, pay here"" program.  Frankly, and I am not pulling the Mitt Romney card, but if no one else will loan you money why make the life hell of someone who will?  There were an endless parade of people coming in and reading them the riot act because their car payment was due!  

The other review I read on this place is trying to nail The Car Company because the car was a POS.  All of these places operate the same way - they go to an auction and buy a product that they can make the most money on.  Most times they only have a car in their possession for less than a week.  It is not a sinister plot that car dealers devise to buy junk cars and dump them off on some poor bastard.

I dunno.... I could go on for days on entitlement and etc... but not the point of the review.  The Car Company treated me well and seem to be a solid company.  If they have another vehicle that I like, at a reasonable price, I would certianly buy from them (cash) again.",2012-10-12 23:13:44

I love the food here, the bottemless steak fries and root beer floats are awesome. I just wish that the service was as good. We walked in and the hostess was very friendly. She seated us in a booth, as we requested. It was just next to a team of softball players celebrating a girl's birhday after their game.  My husband and I were sitting in the booth for almost 20 minutes before anyone came to get our drink order, next to these loud girls.  I was already a little annoyed by this. The coaches brought in the bags of ice from the car, trying to prevent them from melting. They melted, spreading a huge puddle of water. Many people nearly slipped and fell in it, including a couple of servers, as well as myself. I complained to our sever. I am gluten free, I don't want the gluten free bun, so I ordered the teriyaki chicken with lettuce. They brought it out, but didn't bring me any utensils to use. It was 15 minutes before anyone came by us. This server wasn't even ours, but we asked for utensils. By the time they brought them, my food is cold. I also don't have anymore water. Our server finally comes by to ask us how the food is, and I had to ask for water and explain what had happened with the utensils. He apologized and brought us more water, then went back to his tables. I thought that he would send the manager over to talk to us, but nobody came. I am surprised, since they always have in the past for issues like this. The puddle still hadn't been cleaned up when we left.

We had gone in a few weeks earlier, the hostess was nowhere in sight, there were 5 other parties ahead of us in line. We were all standing there for a while. Some people got really frustrated and left. When the hostess finally came up front, she wasn't smiling, and looked surprised to see so many people waiting. I heard someone up front telling her about how long they waited and that a few people left. She apologized and seated them. She finally got to us, still not smiling. It was a while before someone came to get our drink order. We always go on a Tuesday for the 50% off special. I ordered the chicken teriyaki with no bun, as I am gluten free and made sure that no onions were on the dish, they said that it didn't come with onions. The service was so slow. We were so irritated with them not keeping up with our bottomless fries and root beer floats. What was the point of even ordering them if we are not getting the refills?  They finally bring out our food, but my food has a  non-gluten-friendly bun on it, as well as onions. I hate onions, and the item I ordered didn't come with onions. The manager came out, apologized, and gave us a discount on top of the 50% off special, for the mistake and the slow service. We were in a hurry to try and make our movie. My husband paid, but he didn't realize until after that neither discount was on there. We complained again. They said that since we already paid, they couldn't adjust it. They gave us a gift card with the amount we would have had taken off. It took almost an additional 45 min to get this. By this time, we had missed our movie, which was literally across the street.

If you do dine in, they have a cool soda machine with dozens of flavored soda and juice options. I love the Hi-C fruit punch because mentally I'm 5 years old.

Oh and if you're a fan of tofu- definitely try theirs! It's excellent. If I'm in ""diet mode"" I'll just order tofu with quinoa (that's their new grain option and it is really good IMO), and some veggies and it makes for a delicious, healthy, protein-packed lunch. 

When I'm not in ""diet mode"" (which seems to be most of the time lately- eek!), I'll order the honey seared shrimp, add tofu, with quinoa and veggies. It's really good for ""fast casual""!

Pad Thai with tofu is also yummy!

My wife and I tried them out a few days ago, a good piece out in east Mesa.  It was a Friday evening about 6pm and I expected them to be very busy but they were almost empty.  They are located close to the local retirement community and mostly seniors were eating there.  It's clean and bright and service is attentive.  The staff regularly refreshed the food trays and someone was always sweeping the floor.  The food area was about half the size of Pacific Seafood and their sushi section was a lot smaller.
We went there especially for the sushi and were a bit disappointed at the variety.  The sashimi was fresh and basically salmon and tuna, tasted very good but a lot of the sides we enjoy were lacking.  The rolls were nice, 3 different types.  No nigiri, no kimchi, no various Japanese salad items were to be found.  I thought the hot and sour soup didn't have much flavor or heat like that of PSB. The steamed salmon didn't have much taste.  The best hot seafood dish there was wonderful tiny ""Snow Shrimp"".  The sesame balls were dry and practically empty and the soft ice cream was rather icy.
The lemon chicken was tart and dry.  I'm sorry to say I won't be back.  The food overall was rather mediocre.  At least it was several dollars less than my favorite PSB.

The hostess proceeds to sit us next to an infant in a high chair, when there were clearly better decisions that could have been made there given the empty nature of the dining room. 
The hostess came right back and said she would be taking our drink orders, 2 minutes later she delivers a Pepsi and a water. So far so good, except for the screaming kid next to me. 
It is then at least 10 minutes before we first met our waiter, and he was clearly flustered and over-sat. He took our orders quickly, and was off. I ordered Mongolian beef which I love, my better half went with beef lo mein. We quickly got our egg & spring rolls, which were great, and fresh. 
The wait for the food seemed a bit longer than it should have been, but again, that could have been the effect of the screaming infant in my left ear drum.

The sad part is, other than not being piping hot, the food was great. Both my wife and I loved our meals, but the experience was ruined by absolute lack of service. 
On the way out, I asked the manager if there was a customer service e-mail I could have or some kind or corporate contact, and was directed to redbowlusa.com.

The collection highlights Canadian art, which makes sense, seeing as it is a Canadian gallery. Of particular interest to me, and a place I've visited twice, are the ship models in the basement. You can spend an hour just in that section of the museum.

It *is* expensive, and special exhibitions cost extra, which is something I've encountered at other museums, but one thing that is particularly nice is that any price you've paid for a ticket is deductible from a membership, and if you're someone like me, who lives in Buffalo, the price of a distance membership is pretty cheap, and allows you to have another person on the membership who resides in Toronto.

It was like they squeezed it from pre-made store bought caramel bottle. I haven't eaten such a bad ice cream sandwich before.

Now, let's not go crazy.  I wouldn't order EVERYTHING off the menu.  C'mon folks, its a grill next to a sports book.   I still advise making your choices wisely.  Maybe avoid the tongue or the chopped chicken liver sandwich?  I'm just saying . . . not my bag baby.  Of all the things I have ordered, I haven't had anything bad.

The Harlem Underground is housed in the space occupied by the formerly named Irie. Despite having passed Irie about a billion times, it just never looked very inviting, so when I saw that they mixed things up a bit, I thought I'd give it a try. A new interior and a new menu has apparently done wonders for Harlem Underground. 

My interest was piqued when I saw that they served ""soul food"", which I also consider ""southern food"". Being from the American South, I miss what I consider ""home"" or ""comfort"" foods, which would include pretty much everything on the Harlem Underground menu. Their brunch includes such southern delights as Sweet Potato Waffles, Crawfish Etouffee, Frog Legs, and pecan-covered French Toast. I chose the Harlem Benny, which, despite its name, isn't your traditional eggs benedict. Rather, instead of english muffins, HU serves the perfectly cooked poached eggs over a thin sweet potato pancake that's covered with sausage and grits (!). A cheesy hollaindaise is served on the side for dipping or pouring. Also served on the plate was the most delicious side salad EVAR -- baby greens, pear, red and yellow peppers, and pomegranate seeds!

As per usual, I ordered a half order of the French Toast and asked them to surprise me with which one. They were more than accommodating and immediately said ""sure, we can do that -- is $2 fair?"".  

Overal;, the food was fabulous -- very well flavoured, temperature-appropriate, and plentiful. I had a latte with brunch and it was also very good. 

Service was exceptional -- friendly, attentive, and not overly ""in your face"". 

I took a glance at the dinner menu and it looked equally appealing. I will definitely go back to the Harlem Underground -- I just hope it's as good the second time around!

Father and 4 sons are the Five guys of the Five Guys Burger and Fries. Quite simply the company's aim is to serve fresh hamburgers and french fries. The restaurant's popularity grew and heralded great acclaim in the media. Although there hasn't been much coverage in the GTA there's currently 800 restaurants open in North America. In Ontario there's about 10 restaurants open so far.

This Woodbridge location has been around for about year but I only came across it today. It's tucked in a corner unit of a plaza on Weston Rd and Hwy 7.

The look of the restaurant is straight forward featuring an open kitchen, a long counter to order and pickup, red and white checkered pattern color theme. There's stacks of potatoes on the floor and open boxes of complimentary peanuts to snack on. Obviously don't come here if you have a peanut allergy :O  They use peanut oil to cook their fries. The dining area is ample and on that Sunday afternoon when we were there it appears to be a popular spot for families to gather. 

Ordering:

Feeling daring, I ordered the Cheese Burger (2 patties) and Tamara got a little burger. little = 1 patty, 1 small fries and a drink. Toppings are pretty standard affair, nothing out of the ordinary however there is a notable inclusion of grilled onions and mushrooms. Yeah! 

Everything was made fresh to order. I unwrapped this ridiculous beef tower and sunk my teeth into it: 

My impression:

Good flat top fresh ground patty. It contains no additives or seasoning. Made from fresh Canadian beef and pressed each morning according to the manager. The American cheese in my cheese burger oozed out from every which way due to the heat of my burger patties. Although messy to eat the cheese complimented the burger providing a bit more needed taste. The sesame bun was thick but kept it all together. Overall the burger was alright but it wasn't very tasty. 

The small order of fries, which in my opinion is an extra large were simply THE BEST FRIES I've ever had!  They are made from whole Canadian potatoes and cooked in peanut oil.

The manager and staff were very friendly and hospitable. The manager personally came over to our table to talk with us, checking how everything was and giving us a little history and information on the company. 

In summary:

It's cost is higher compared to other fast food burger chains however everything here is king kong sized. The highlight for me were the fries and the unlimited drinks refills. 

It's worth trying though if you hadn't been.

We ordered the Greek salad and Bourbon burger with cottage cheese.  Both plates looked great and had nice portions.  I appreciated that the vinaigrette wasn't too sweet, a lot of places will add sugar.  The burger was cooked perfectly and had nice toppings.

I came here with a large group for a birthday celebration last Friday night. The receptionist was very courteous and were lenient with time modifications. When I got to the restaurant, it made more sense as it was quite deserted for a Friday night. There were about 5 other tables that were seated between 8:30 PM (when we arrived at the restaurant) to 11:00 PM. 

I was pleased with how multiple servers were assisting us instead of designating the responsibility onto one individual. However, I found it interesting when I was comparing the service my table was receiving versus the service other tables/couples were receiving. It was evident that we certainly weren't a priority, and rather we felt unwanted (this was an observation noted amongst several party members). 

As for food - it was, like what my rating suggests, A-OK. I ordered the gnocchi. The gnocchi consistency was a little off. The pasta tasted too flour-y and starchy instead of fluffy and soft. The sauce was mediocre. A joke that went around the table was that the pasta sauce for my gnocchi and my friends' mushroom lasagna was the same as the two soups one of my other friends ordered. Note, he ordered a tomato-based soup and a mushroom-based soup. 

Pros:
I loved the ambiance and their patio however, this is not a place I would come back solely for food. It's great for the social scene and chit chatting.

Voodoo Lounge is over on 16th Ave. I first heard of it when some local shows last summer, but I hadn't had a chance to venture in. Then, I had a best friend that decided it would be a good idea to move to Calgary, which has me on the lookout for gluten free and dairy free joints. Though I'm not sure if lactose free necessarily means dairy-free, Voodoo Lounge remains on my radar for three reasons:

1) They make delicious pizza. I've had it on a few different occasions now. Must try: Acropolis
2) 25 flavours of wings that are gluten-free. That's right! Just follow the little symbol next to the flavour. 
3) The kitchen is open until midnight... 7 nights a week. If you've got late night hunger, now you know where to go!

General tips: The tables are bolted to the floor. This scares me slightly, and makes me think I should be avoiding Voodoo on especially busy days. So, best time to pop in? For lunch or dinner on a weekday. Apparently they've also got a private party room in the basement.

Anyway, order the pizza. So far, that impresses me! Or... if you've got more dietary restrictions, try ordering from the salad bar! Add your choice of any free toppings starting at $8, then add chicken, steak, prawns, or Italian sausage for $3.50 each. Yummy, yummy salad? I think so!

Until Muku, they only experience I'd had with ramen was the college experience. You know, the one where you and the roommates roll into the Superstore parking lot in 1988 Mazda and a cloud of smoke (from the car, of course). You pool your pennies together (remember pennies?) and if you're lucky, you have enough for the giant bold yellow box of No Name ramen noodles. Hooray, nourishment for a month! There were two ways I knew how to cook these noodles - you could put them in a pot of water, get distracted with Mario Kart and come back to a mushy mess, or you could open the package and gnaw on the brick of them. To me, that was ramen. While I look back fondly on this experience, I'm also very happy to say that Muku Japanese Noodle House shattered it!

***Before you even get into the restaurant you will pass two signs exclaiming NO SUSHI! Judging by the signs, It seems like maybe a person or two has come in asking if they carry sushi.  I don't know if they do or not. I didn't ask.

Get ready to be cozy with your neighbours and possibly wait in a line. I was there at 6:30 on a very cold Thursday and there was no line, but it was right full. They've got a waiting list at the front as I'm sure on any other less arctic day, you'll have a wait.

The servers were so friendly and very quick. I went for the Kanban - the Miso Ramen their menu says they're famous for, but with fatty pork (their words) and cabbage on top.

The servers were quick. The food? not so much. After ordering it took about half an hour for the soup to arrive. It didn't seem like I was forgotten about as other people were waiting about this long. I guess that's just how long noodles take here. Be prepared to not be quickly in and out.

As you may have gathered from the opening ramble, I'm no ramen expert. But I did get a tasty, hot and filling meal that had me diving in full face-plant., slurping, and  being an embarrassing mess. They had classic rock radio turned up and as it turns out, Eric Clapton makes for some top notch ramen munchin' music. I loved every second of it.

Once your done with your eye opening ramen experience you can hone your driving skills trying to leave their tight parking lot. How did I get in there??

Muku is quirky, adorable and cool. I can't wait to bring people here!",2014-02-07 06:57:46

I don't usually like tapas because I think it only works when there is big group to share food.  In addition, the portion is too small for the price.  Izakaya Ju survives my 2 biggest criticisms of tapas well.

My family came to celebrate Chinese New Year.  We ordered so many dishes that I could not remember the names.  I did recall that the rice entrees (we ordered 2 to share) were excellent.  They were fresh, tasty, soft yet with texture, uniquely flavoured.  They were well portioned for 1 person as a meal, so I thought ""oh, even a lone diner can order a meal easily here"".  Just like that, Izakaya passed my first criticism.  I also really liked the stuffed chicken wings.  The wings were well fried and well seasoned.  I recommend them even they were one of the more expensive items on menu.  I was not impressed with the yakitori combo.  It sounded like a good platter on paper, except one of the items in the combo was just tasty soft bones.  For vegetarians, please note that Izakaya Ju had one vegetarian noodle entree on menu.  

As for my second criticism of tapas, the rice and noodle entrees, the stuffed chicken wings, the salmon in broth and the yakitoris were reasonably priced for the portion and representative of the skills and work it took to make them.  The mixed mushroom was over priced in my opinion.  The grilled eggplant was not memorable because the flavour was non-descriptive, as in not spicy, not salty, not sweet.  Just eggplant with a hint of soy sauce.

Services were excellent.  The various servers were helpful, polite and fairly efficient given how busy the restaurant was.  We had a party of 5 adults, 2 seniors and 2 children.  The restaurant was totally accommodating and gave us a long table, so we could sit together.  The restaurant was family friendly, and the waitresses were gentle with the children.  

We made reservation, so we didn't have to line up at the door in cold weather.  Reservation strongly recommend for large party.",2015-03-05 04:13:08

We had a nice view of the Strip (including the Bellagio fountains). Good comfy beds. Decent bathroom (though, no tub, just a shower). The decor was decent too. No robes, no minibar. But for a place to rest your head at night in Sin City, you could do way worse. And it's a pretty good central location too.

However, there isn't much else to do at the Flamingo. There's a couple of ok shows, but it ends there. The restaurant options are sucky. Room service is no more than 2 stars. The stores are sucky. Etc.

So for the right price, it's a good room, but not much else.

And then, of course, there's the issue that the valet lost our car keys. Yep, lost our car keys. What are the friggin' odds of that happening? Either way, can't say I would recommend valeting your car here. Why take that gamble?

Yelp hasn't led me wrong yet...but anyways, I had wanted to try Matka, was starting to see the reviews and thought oh it's time to check this place out! When I suggested it he said yea sounds good.  That right their gave him some points, cuz it's normally my girlfriends that I talk into going with me to try new ethnic cuisines.

So got their around 6:30pm, Date looked cute & fly! We walked inside and saw we were one of the 1st people there, the owner, who was present was very friendly and helpful with everything. The place is very cute on the inside; I think we were early, because we had decided on trying out the dinner buffet to try a little bit of everything, and the owner asked us to give him a few mins to get all the serving spoons out. No problem we stayed at our table and sat and talked,  then owner said its ready! Oh yea baby I was starving and ready to go!

I tried a cauliflower dish, don't know what it was called but god it was good! Spicy, smoky and just delish, had a potato dish too, think its called aloo methi? Man that too was packed with little bit of heat, but not in a bad way, those 2 dishes might even get me to be a vegetarian for maybe a hour or so, um maybe not because I then spotted the butter chicken in that creamy orange sauce and the chili chicken with big slices of jalapenos and though who can live on veggie alone! Both the butter chicken and chili chicken are white meat and so very delish, also had some of the vegetable biryani and nana bread too.  Meal and Date were perfect! It was a good night!

Also side note, my date tried the goat biryani and thought it to be spicy and told the owner, who tried it and said yea it's on the spicy side, will make up a new batch right now, now to me that's excellent service!

The falafel's were probably the best thing in this combo, and they were mediocre at best. Taboulleh was a bit soggy and nowhere near lemony enough. Baba G was not smoky, just bland.

a nice place to grab a quick bite or just to enjoy coffee while doing some light work

i went on a friday so i had their daily drink special which happened to be londond fog aka my favourite latte. it was really affordable - 3$ for a large cup. it was waterdown like most places. i also tried their almond croissant cuz that's my favourite bakery item. tbh, i've had better croissants. this one was firm/crunchy and the almond flavour was lost on me

the reason i'm giving this place a 4 star is because of their unique and delicious ice cream flavours. i got 3 ice cream pints: 

cinnamon with toasted apples - mouth watering delicious! huge chunks of apples and the cinnamon flavours really pulled through. i honestly thought i was eating a homemade apple pie with authentic vanilla icecream with each spoon. has got to be my favourite of the 3

pistachio with baklava - didn't really taste the pistachio flavour but the crunchy pieces of baklava really dis it for me. it gave it a nice crunch and it made me feel like i was eating a Greek pastery

strawberry thai mint - my least of all the 3 partly because it was gelato and because it tasted more like
 guava rather than strawberry with thai mint

Each dish order comes with either Russian Borsche/Cream Soup with dinner rolls. Bread is rarely served these days so it was a pleasant surprise! Also there is a tea to drink (the lemon tea is really bitter) as well as dessert (lychee jelly with condensed milk)

We double-checked the address on the Groupon (Rural & Chandler) and then dove into three entrees and an appetizer.  My brother in law saw the white servers and the non-Vietnamese atmosphere and adeptly ordered a burger.  I shared a pho bo and stir fry beef dish with rice.  Pho Bo was okay.  The broth was very sweet in the Southern Viet style.  Beef slices were neither plentiful or scarce.  I don't usually eat that many noodles, but I found the serving to be skimpy.  They used the pho cut of beef (eye of round) in the stir fry which was very strange.  It was served with a sweet soy sauce concoction and we asked for nuoc cham (fish dipping sauce) and we were given a viscous and strangely sweet sauce.  I've never seen a Vietnamese person serve such a thing.  Plus they added an extra charge on the bill for the sauce, wtf.

The tofu appetizer was overpriced and not worth it.  I'm gonna have to buy a $1.30 box of tofu from Lee Lee to erase that dish from my memory.

I'm not sure what atmosphere the owners are going for.  This place gives me a weird feeling in my tummy.  Flat screens everywhere for sports fans.  Seems like if you're a single guy who enjoys Americanized/fusion food and often dines alone then this is the place for you.  If you''re looking for a gastronomic experience you will be underwhelmed.

Don't worry by my second pint this review gets friendlier. 

Let's start with the appetizers and the curious price of curry and chips. $8.95.The price of the curry sauce and the chips ($2.50 and $4.00 when ordered separately)  is an application of new math that I find puzzling. *

Ok the first pint is warming me up and it's time to praise the banger wontons Nope it's not an Asian street gang but a dab of pork sausage and herbs within a wonton wrapper.  These are really good, pretty inventive and the spicy sauce that comes with them ( seems to be HP , Vinegar and something I can't quite put my  tongue on ( horseradish?)  , while good, is a little  overpowering for the center.  We really liked these.

Pint 2:

My wife had the beer battered fish and chips and loved them but she'll get to that in her review. I had the shepherd's pie boxty , basically ground lamb/ beef  wrapped up in a potato based crepe/ pancake.  The filling was light, moist and nicely spiced  unlike the usual attempts by most places to hide up a culinary crime scene. E.g If you can't do the thyme...  The accompanying veggies, asparagus and peppers were a nice touch and you can see the visual appeal of the dish on the accompanying picture. 

Desert. 

We had. ok we ordered,  the Irish whiskey creme brulee , most of the desserts here are about as Irish as George Takei, and it was absent of any whiskey taste that either of us could discern.It's OK but a let down given the promise.    Knocking off .5 stars for that and the appetizer pricing. 

Food came out really quickly  in under 10 mins. It  was about 1430 when we came in and the place was kinda quiet. Mallory provided great service throughout.

*I wrote their corp office and Eric returned an explanation within an hour. the disparity in the chip/curry conundrum lies with the curry sauce. The ""side"" of sauce is supposed to be 3oz less than the appetizer.",2009-05-26 04:14:27

I've spent years bitching about the lack of even a DECENT chinese place near our house (Baja Arcadia). I kept looking to Scottsdale for somewhere to eat. We've got just about everything else, from real-deal taco shacks, to excellent Pho, to fine dining. But no real Chinese food. I was looking the wrong way. Up til recently, I would drive all the way to Wong's Place in Tempe just for the real stuff.


THE CHINESE CULTURAL CENTER
I shop regularly at what used to be Ranch99, that oasis in the desert that makes you feel like you've been transported to the Hell that is Riverside CA. I've tried numerous restaurants in the mall over the years and always been disappointed. The one I never managed to try is the Szechwan Palace. I expected it to be just another Gringonese disaster. Man was I wrong. We eat out maybe once or twice a week, and we've hit this place at least once a week since we found it a few months ago.


SZECHWAN PALACE
I love you, Palace. Dan Dan Noodles. Spice. Yu Xiang dishes. We've been when it's packed full of high maintenance Chinese businessmen and when we're one of 4 tables in the place. Every time, the tiny kitchen and the wonderful servers keep their smiles in place and just give you that little shake of the head that says: ""Solly, it clazy tonight!"" Even though this place pleases real Chinese food lovers, there's plenty of stuff to keep my Jewish mother-in-law happy too (""happy"" is a relative term).


THINGS I LOVE
  - Wan Fu: the worst white wine in the world (that I love)
  - Dan Dan Noodles with extra hot chile
  - Yu Xiang Shrimp
  - Mongolian Beef with real beef, not that over-marinated rubbery crap
  - Fresh veggies that still have some color and snap to them
  - Incredibly spicy Water-boiled dishes
  - Any of their soups

Wong's thick-skinned pot stickers are still the best, but everything else at the Palace rules.


BOTTOM LINE
It's hard for me to imagine a bad review being credible unless some key person was missing or they were ridiculously understaffed and got slammed. We've been there for one of those nights though, and it was still very good, once we eventually got served. As others have said: get the real menu as you walk in. Otherwise, you'll get the Panda Express version. You'll also have to grab chopsticks. Other than that, just enjoy!",2009-10-16 23:44:19

Also found out the most of the prices on the menu went up so they really need to update there menu so people who are new to ordering from a place like me will know and there regular customers will know also they told me it would be a 15 dollar delivery charge with my order which I think was ridiculous and highway robbery but companies will find away to get more money out of you one way or another. Now onto the food the driver delivers my food I pay him expect the change back and he's not sure what to give me back I think he knew just didn't want to come out of his pocket to give me the exact change but whatever I get my food pizza is really delicious probably not as good as some of the mom and pop pizza places I went to but for the quality you get it's good. The chicken wings were good a few wings were overcooked more then others but it was still good would love to try there fries but I might order them the next time I order from here overall with some of the positives and negatives I mentioned this place is not that bad and it might be better then some of the other different pizza places that I didn't have much of a good experience if they didn't charge as much as they did for the delivery charge this place and if some of the wings weren't overcooked and the other problem I mentioned with the delivery driver this place would easily get 5 stars from me but overall I see myself checking this place out again when I get a chance.,2015-08-07 23:34:12

I'm vegetarian but I avoid large amounts of dairy and eggs and any other animal product (although I'm not actually vegan).  It's really nice to go to a restaurant and not have to worry about picking through ""oh does this have meat hidden it it"".  In a typical restaurant, the only non-meat items are ridiculously cheesy pasta which I won't eat either.  It also has a lot of gluten free options which are great for people who don't eat gluten!  Amazing how they can do that.

First time I went, I had the Lucky ChowMein and my boyfriend had the Pad Thai.  Both were delicious.  I had so much left over that I took about half home ... I added some more veggies and tofu to it at home and made it into two more lunches!!  Second time I went, I had the Shanghai Noodle and my boyfriend had the Thai Curry.  The curry was a bit spicy for me.  The Shangai Noodle was very good as well.  It had a ""spicy"" label on it but it was NOT spicy at all so I'm not sure why it had that label.  It had flavour yes, but it wasn't spicy.  We also got the spring rolls appetizer both times which is delicious.  Another thing is that I've never gone to any place that makes tofu even close to how we make it at home.  It's usually plain and boring.  However, the Loving Hut makes pretty good tofu!!

My favourite was the Lucky ChowMein.  I'd like to try the tofu appetizer and one of their burgers sometime.  I'd also like to try the dessert sometime.  I definitely plan to go back.  Very good pricing on the amount of food that you get as well.  A really nice environment inside as well.  Very friendly staff.  Love this place.",2013-10-25 16:09:04

Our waitress was one of the best I've had in a long time.  Her recommendation of the duck tacos was spot on, I should have listened.  My friend got those and I can't even remember what I got.

Geisha A Go Go is great for Happy Hours and Sunday specials.  This place is on prime real estate in the heart of Oldtown Scottsdale.  The place is still a rock and roll hall of fame kind of decor mixed with some anime-like feel.

I usually come for drinks and to meetup with friends to start the night before heading out.  Needless to say, it's still the same way.  I don't eat here much but they do have some interesting rolls; Pokemon, Bye Bye Kitty, and Dragonball just to name a few.  We started with the basics of calamari, egg rolls, and some chicken wings; very basic is the key, but the chipotle aioli is always welcoming.  We progressed with some rolls starting with the Samurai Warrior, a rice-less roll wrapped by green rice paper within albacore, salmon, spicy tuna, shrimp, avocado, and snow crab, served with a garlic ponzu sauce.  Probably my favorite of the night since it was not too heavy, but the garlic ponzu sauce gave it a mouth watering punch.  The second roll we had was the Seared Salmon Special; again a rice-less roll with what seemed to be pretty much the same to me as the Samurai, but with less ingredients.  

In the end, we ordered my basic spicy tuna rolls and sorts, but the drinks is why you come to Geisha A Go Go and also the Karaoke; which they opened it up to open mic nights.  No more renting rooms here, just get up and sing!  As for the drink I would say their most popular among women is the Hello Kitty; Japanese strawberry soda, citrus vodka mixed with infused sake.  For the guys, I say go with the infused sake.  They have everything from mango, pomegranite, blueberry, and cucumber lemongrass. - Enjoy!",2016-07-25 19:46:14

I, like the review by Jeff F., stopped in for Food Truck Friday on 4-22-2011 and had almost the same thing he had:   the chicken and okra gumbo and the fried catfish SANDWICH special.  

Both were definitely super-tasty.  

The gumbo was a $5, decently large portion that was yummy, not overly salty, and full of large chunks of chicken and okra and sausage with a saucy white rice base.  I was amazed at the sheer number of chunks of meat or okra - it never ended, all the way to the last scrape of the paper-lined cardboard bowl.

The catfish in the sandwich was coated with your basic cornmeal batter, served on buttered Texas toast, with some kind of mayo sauce and lettuce and tomatoes.  It was large enough that I saved half of it for part of  my breakfast on Saturday.  I'd like to add that the catfish fillet was VERY THICK.  One of the thickest catfish cuts I have seen in this town.

One of the best uses of $10 I have seen in a while.  Worth the money, tasty as all get-out, and a signal that eating again off this truck is in my future.",2011-04-25 20:24:11

Cafe Krisha has been open for a while and has still failed to supply guests with a menu that marks what items are suitable for vegans. 

At vegetarian restaurants, a menu that marks what is vegan is not just a convenience, it is a standard. Cafe Krishna stands virtually alone in the Phoenix as the only vegetarian restaurant that fails to offer this.

This wouldn't be an issue if servers were more willing to ensure that products were dairy free. Getting a confirmation that a menu items are dairy-free from the servers feels like pulling teeth, and I making people's lives more difficult makes me feel uncomfortable. I just want to sit down and eat with no worries. 

A simple ""V"" next to all the vegan items would make me feel more inclined to eat at Cafe Krishna, it would make me feel more certain about what I was eating, and it would make the lives for the servers easier not having to run back and forth the kitchen every time I (and every other vegan) have a question about dairy in my food.

That aside, the food at Krishna can be quite good. I've had crispy, spicy gobi manchurian here and I've had mild, crumbly gobi manchurian. The rasam and sambar is always good. And the dosas are usually a pretty safe bet. I had my first experience with uttapam here, and it was quite good but I'll be sure to ask for no raita next time! 

So, Cafe Krishna, mark the vegan items, and work on a little consistency and you could easily outscore any other Indian join in town.",2010-08-26 19:01:23

Our first piece of advice: Watch the fine print, don't sign on that electronic pin pad device until you've seen the paper contracts! Here's how they worked us:  After we asked a LOT about our monthly cost, they tell you about your bill (what you want to hear), you get excited, you sign the electronic signature pad device which was so outdated and old before you see the paperwork. They continue getting your phone ready and 15-30 minutes, THEN they print off your paper contracts and stuff it in your bag with all your stuff. They get you hyped so your not thinking about the bill. 

30 Days later....BOOM! Our bill was DOUBLE what we were paying monthly. Terrible.

2nd piece of advice: Don't sign anything until you see the Paper Contracts. 

3rd piece of advice: Don't do business here. AT & T is right down the way OR if you have to do Verizon, go down to an actual Corporate store. Don't do Independent Retailer stores. This one was terrible.

It's by UNLV, so obviously the lines can get a little out of control during the semester. I tend to hit this one up during the times when UNLV is not in session.

I tend to always get a chicken burrito, black beans, little sprinkle of cheese, dash of sour cream, and a bunch of lettuce. I'm hardly ever disappointed with Chipotle, after all the ingredients are fresh and the meats are hormone free, etc.

The parking here is pretty ridiculous though. I don't know how many times I've pulled in, done a loop and had to end up back out on Maryland Parkway to drive back in and just head to one of the further back lots.

I really like that the kitchen is open and you can watch the chefs cook your food. I also think the staff is a little friendlier than at Gallo.

You're served the same two sauces as at Gallo, but you get chips. I also had a one person serving of guacamole, which was so good. Definitely some of the best guacamole I've had. I love that you can order a smaller portion, as my husband doesn't care for guacamole and if it's just the two of us eating Mexican, we don't get guacamole as an appetizer because it ends up being too big a portion. This ended up being perfect.

I had a veggie taco (kale, cauliflower, and squash) and a shrimp taco. My husband had the naco torta. The veggie taco was fantastic - I loved the mix of vegetables and the sauce they used. The shrimp was also excellent, with a really great slaw on top. The naco torta was huge and delicious - perfectly cooked over medium eggs and tender beef. It was rich and delicious.

We didn't intend on getting dessert but we decided to try the coconut pudding. I thought the consistency was a little thin, but it was creamy, smooth, and not too sweet. It was topped with some shaved chocolate which simply added to the richness. A great ending to a great meal.

It's a pretty nice menu for vegetarians; each section (apps, salads, sandwiches, entrees) has a few meatless meals. I opted for the Greek salad because 1) I wuv Greek salads and 2) I saw it came with it's own portion of hummus and pita. Heyo!

Hey-NO. The hummus was more of a...chickpea mash and that's IT.  I was so confused, since there were obvious amounts of SOME kind of green herb (Parsley? Cilantro? WHAT?) but it didn't taste like ANYTHING. No Tahini, no zip of lemon juice, no cumin...NOTHING. I'm just going to have to make my own hummus this week, since I make the best in the universe.

The salad, however, was a delight. It's a big portion (as it should be, for $12) and comes with fresh greens, sliced cherry tomatoes, kalamatas, tons of red onion (lucky for me, I love red onion), whole chickpeas and feta. There wasn't too much dressing overpowering the thing, which is such a salad deal-breaker. It almost made me forget my hummus heartbreak. Almost!

They have a huge variety of flavors, teas, coffees, etc. etc. etc. It almost is overwhelming how many questions they ask about you just to order a milk tea. I think that shows how much they care about the customers. We were asked, ""How sweet would you like it?"" and we all said ""Normal??"" The best part is, that if you don't like it, they offer to remake it for you asap. Brew Tea was super busy, and yet, they wanted to make sure every customer is happy.

I ordered the normal sweet, large, boba milk tea. And it was amazing. I like to judge a new place based on their milk tea - if it's not good, then I don't trust it. Thanks Brew, I owe you one.",2016-08-14 03:10:21

Is this really the best that a world-class city like Calgary can do?  I grew up with Taylor Field (ie. Mosaic Stadium) - it's a sad state of affairs when Saskatchewan is ahead of Alberta in the infrastructure game.  Or Edmonton for that matter when you compare Commonwealth Stadium to McMahon.

Why I dislike coming here (and this has nothing to do with the general atmosphere at a Stamps game...which are usually pretty fun):

- Limited to no parking at the stadium itself (Pro: Easy access to the C-Train), and I have no idea how one would ever get a parking or tailgating spot.  If you do drive, it is a gong show getting to or from the general area during sporting events.

- Chairs with no backs.  Seriously, it's 2013 - I'm sure we could spend a little money getting proper chairs that aren't wooden backless benches.

- Limited space in the concourses.  I went to the Stamps/Riders game this summer - it was an absolute nightmare trying to get from your seats to get drinks or to the washroom.  I can only imagine what would happen if, God forbid, there was ever an emergency during a game.  This lack of space is especially evident at half-time, where line-ups for food and booze are very long.  Service for drinks is VERY slow!

- Washrooms - I will give them a point for at least having decent washrooms that are generally clean.

- Stairs - If you ever have the misfortune of sitting in the cheap seats amongst the riffraff that tends to frequent Stamps games, not only can you expect to leave with a sore back and bum, but also expect to fear for your life walking up and down slippery metal stairs.

All in all, McMahon has limited redeeming features.  Time to tear it down and start over again.",2013-08-15 21:38:47

Highly recommend their salads- start at $10, add on protein separately. Price seems steep til you realize the portion could feed a whole family. The Greek with Falafel was literally all I ate one day, fresh and packed with olives. Add a side of hummus and pita, which comes out piping hot from the oven. 

Went in another day for a chicken shawarma wrap- super moist with tons of tahini and grilled onions. For best results, upgrade to the eggplant fries, they're lightly battered and seasoned and frankly, life-changing. I dip them in straight Sriracha and dream of them. My guy loved the combination lunch plate(chicken and steak). The grilled onions on that are awesome too, and I like how they use a sauce and herbs in their rice to keep it from being the same generic white rice you get everywhere else in town. Meat and veggies were perfectly grilled.

I typically stay at Hilton Hotels when travelling for work as I like taking advantage of my Honors rewards.  When I learned that a recent meeting I would be attending would be taking place at a Marriott I was a bit disappointed as I have been Hilton-spoiled.  

I decided to check in early and called to ask about their policy on early check in.  I was told that even though it was still a bit early in the morning that I could still check and I was pleasantly surprised I didn't get any pushback on this.  When I arrived a short time later I approached the check in desk and explained I was checking in early for my reservation for that night.  The front desk clerk had either pulled an all nighter or just wasn't very bright as she kept asking me how my stay was and referring to my check out.  I had to interrupt a few times and re-explain that I was checking in.  When she finally realized she processed my form of payment and got me my keys, etc.  I had made sure when placing my reservation they had my Marriott Rewards # on file as well.  Even though I don't stay at Marriott properties often, I wanted to ensure I credited my account for future purposes.  After she finished my check in, I proceeded to ask her where the meeting rooms for this hotel were as it was my first time here and I wasn't familiar with the property.  I don't think she understood again what I was asking as she walked around to the front of the check in desk to point out where the elevators to the rooms were.  Again, I had to clarify I was asking about the meeting/conference rooms, not my actual room.  

I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the room and furnishings.  As I tried to log in and work off my laptop, much to my dismay, I found out that there is only free wi-fi if you are a Gold Marriott Rewards member or above.  I was shocked as Hilton properties don't put this stipulation on any of its guests, regardless of their Honors level.  As it was a work visit I didn't give it much thought as it would be expensed, but had I been staying here for personal reasons, I would have been livid at having to pay $9.95 plus taxes/fees per day for Internet.  Not that I don't have $10 to spare, but for the sheer principle.  This wasn't a cheap hotel.  

The meeting facilities were spacious and accomodating.  My company had managed to reserve every room for the various meetings and breakout sessions that were occurring.  The quality of the food prepared by their banquet facilities was also pretty good for a mass production deal.  Another issue I experienced was that two weeks after my stay, I noticed I had not been credited for my stay through the Marriott Rewards program.  Odd I thought as they had the number upon reservation and check in.  I had to submit my receipt to them again in order to have it credited to my account.  

My overall rating for this property was based mainly on the lack of customer service.  I guess I am spoiled by how much Hilton values their guests, which really shouldn't be a feat given that you are a paying guest.",2013-02-22 20:28:12

Some of the servers here do not speak english so the language barrier can be difficult. While some people were sitting down, there was a server that was speaking really loud in chinese and you can tell with her tone she was pissed off. My dad said that she was mad that more and more people were coming and sitting down. Not sure why she was getting so mad especially since the hostess walked us to that area and told us this is where we were going to eat at. That same server was so rude. You would ask her for a napkin or a straw and she would huff and puff. 

The food was good. I didn't try all of it though. My favorite was the eggs and shrimp and the crispy pork. They would bring out each dish at each table for all of us to share. There was plenty of food for everyone.

HyLWHusKsWWgSWmG0W5iqw,GxkY7BqazkQu6I9HBDpbqQ,nsSfCKW9KDB4COj9bzXApw,2,3,3,1,"Red Lobsters around the country have gone through a recent renovation of both their decor and their menus that you may have missed. The move has made the restaurant into more of an upscale offering, with concordant higher prices. It is the act of offering that is now more upscale, however, and not necessarily what is offered to you.

The change results in an additional menu section where you can choose any of a selection of fresh fish and then choose how you want it cooked (oven, pan or broil). Then you get a couple of their standard sides for $13-20. The rest of the menu, other than the big crustaceans, is cheaper than this. Its not a bad deal if the fish is good and fresh and then cooked skillfully. In my limited recent experience, (one recent trip to this location and two recent trips to other Red Lobsters) their cooking is hit or miss. I was very happy with my broiled salmon in terms of size, flavor and doneness. Others have been less enthusiastic, with classic fish complaints (size/strong smell/consistency). Don't worry, they still have their stupendous cheddar biscuits and the coconut fried shrimp with rum sauce that are even better. These shrimp are so good, I think of them as the crab rangoons of the Red Lobster and get them every time.

The rest is pretty much the same, but with slightly different (less?) stuff on the walls and probably higher prices than you may remember. They have a decent variety of beers and booze and a chain restaurant's expected  bevy of froofy drinks. But is it worth it? If you go for one of the shrimp or lobster fests, or you have a coupon or gift card to soften the blow, its definitely worth it. I am a pretty frugal guy, and even though I love fish, there are many places I would rather spend this kind of money at, like Yellowfin.

3XjO6m_Cm1VJI1-8BYxAlQ,_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,eUuKXhloFVHdQsLdodcLbw,4,2,1,1,"Time for an update.

I've found over the many times that I've been here since last review that, while they do offer pretty good food with some vaguely healthy ingredients, they don't have that something special to warrant my previous five star rating.

- The beef tagine hasn't lived up to the first time that I had it.
- While the falafel balls are still good, especially if you have it in a wrap and get a salad that (ironically) doesn't include chickpeas, I have definitely had better places.
- The meat options that I've tried are pretty decent but not great. Steak shawarma was a letdown. Beef kebab was pretty good but isn't really worth a ten minute additional wait (cook time).

I would call them somewhat of an Americanized take on the cuisine since they don't really have all the spices (or sweet/spicy sauces) that you find at great falafel / shawarma places. My friend actually had a beef BBQ baguette today, and I'm pretty sure the BBQ-esque flavor that I sampled doesn't belong in any sort of authentic restaurant of this sort. Still, with the prevalence of their salad mix and spicy carrots, they're a decent casual place for food that doesn't feel wholly unhealthy.

One more thing: you should know that they've been raising their prices and that they seem to do some strange things with entering Groupons at the register. Regarding prices, I'm pretty sure salads and large wraps were $8.49, baguettes were $7.49, and regular wraps were $6.49 today. Regarding Groupon, I'm guessing that the value is applied after tax or something, but others and I have found ourselves to be paying unusual (albeit small) amounts of cash when we didn't expect to owe anything.",2014-05-29 05:10:48

Plenty of humor and crowd participation as well. I was actually called up on stage and put in a box locked away while my wife was hit on in the audience by the host. Classic.

Not sure what the show is about but I've heard things that are bizarre. I'll let you do your own research and figure it out for yourself.

Show is 90 minutes long and doesn't feel like it at all. Seriously the show begins and next thing you know it's over.

The seating was great. It didn't seem like there was a bad seat in the house. I sat 3 rows from stage but I would like to see the show from the back as well to see all of it. I felt like I was missing something above my head or behind me because I was so close.

Food: Here, the cuisine is very diverse and is all about sharing! Tapas style cuisine is how B & E operates! We tried some simple dishes like their onion rings,kale and apple salad, along with the poke tacos that came recommended. All of the food was amazing and delicious with just enjoy flavor. I did think the poke tacos should've come with 4 versus 3 as an even number versus most people like us paying for the 4th.

Drinks: Beauty & Essex has some Handcrafted cocktails to die for! We tried the Green with Envy (pretty spicy) and the Delorean which was perfectly savory! The purées and add ins were fresh and there was lots of love and time taken to make each drink.  

Ambiance: B & E has a pretty cool vibe! There's a pawn shop storefront before you head into the restaurant which was a cool surprise. As you walk in for dinner, there's a mellow DJ playing casual music you can talk over while bopping around to. The decor was super eclectic. There was lots of good and pearl and black mixed with small elements that made the walls hard to not stare at! 

Service: Everyone from the front staff to our server to the bartender and service staff made the experience a positive one! Each person was friendly while offering recommendations and checked in on our experience. They were quick but didn't make us feel rushed if you know what I mean.

Overall:  I can't wait to visit here again when I'm hanging out at the Cosmopolitan. B & E is one of the awesome places you find that remind you of just why the Cosmo is such a unique hotel compared to most.

Maybe we just ordered wrong?  I was super hyped about District One and I even braved the cramped parking lot with our SUV just to try this place out.  But we came away just a bit underwhelmed.  No pop!  No wow!  Just a long, drawn out poot.

District One was hoppin', no joke there.  Sports on the TV, alcohol flowin' freely, and lots of heads on tables.  Very busy but luckily no wait when we visited.  The place is nice - modern, vibey, nice leather booths.  Shiny & new!  But the food...eh...was a bit lackluster.

I love me some Vietnamese food, and I love me some fusion.  But while that may be good and appreciated, I gotta sway back to the classics.  What good is fusion if you don't have the classic down?  Does one not learn how to walk first before trying a 360 kick flip?  Do you just approach Heidi Klum and MInka Kelly without mastering the art of taking the 'grenade'?  I think not.

Perhaps we should have ordered differently at District One, because what we had just didn't impress.  The menu looks delicious, rice dishes, soups, noodles, lots of Asian-inspired cuisine.  But that day I really wanted pho, and the wifey really wanted wings.  

We started off with the Tamarind Wings.  Wow.  For $6, I'm sorry to say, I felt a bit ripped off.  These were 6 of the tiniest @$$ wings I've ever seen!  At $1 a piece damn were they small.  I mean, these wings were literally half the size of those you see at a place like Wing Stop.  Nearly no meat!  I guess I wouldn't have complained if they were some bomb-diggety wings...but...they were bland.  Oh, just bland.  There was a bit of sweetness to them but that was it.  One note.  No mixing of flavors, no sour, no heat, no crunch, no nothing.  I don't think they were properly seasoned as well because I didn't get much of a salty flavor either.  So plain.  This app definitely left the wifey and I hungry and hoping the main dish would fit the bill.

We both stayed basic and got the Pho Bo Vien, the beef pho.  It came to the table steaming hot, nice.  But again....what's with the portion?  The bowl was smaller than what we were used to at other Vietnamese places around town.  And for $8 each, we were a bit surprised.  At other decent places around town, for the same price I can get the special pho with more goodies, and in a bigger bowl.  We got our little plate of veggies as well for sharing.  This included some basil, bean sprouts, and fresh chilies.  The pho was pretty good, District One has some great broth.  Not overly salty, lots of complex flavor, good on the palette.  But boy did I crave for more noodles and more beef to sop this broth up.  

The service for us was excellent.  Server was very attentive, wasn't hesitant to let us know if we had any questions on the menu to just ask.    Water was kept filled.

Overall it was an OK first visit to District One.  The wifey and I left hungry and were eating again less than two hours later.  I think place does warrant another visit, but maybe next time we'll go with the more popular dishes they serve.  I do fancy some Big Bone Soup or some Oxtail Pho!",2014-04-22 19:44:08

We each got a margarita sample (specialized salted rim for each of them!) and the guacamole sample.

The smoked trout guac was divine.  However, for two people it was way too much guac (we took half of it home and it kept well for two days).

Got the Italian combo Mike's way which included oregano, oil & vinegar, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, etc.  All cold cuts were cut at the moment of preparation which means that all were super fresh.  I had a choice of white or wheat bread (not whole wheat) which was a darker version of the white.  I don't think that the servers know that white bread is still wheat bread... I digress.  
Ate the sandwich home and thought the sandwich was amazing.  I like the fact that the bread was not that thick--more cold cuts than bread and that there was a nice crunch with the added veggies.  At my request they added hot cherry peppers and they did deliver a hot punch which I enjoyed.  Speedy service too!

I went as part of a party of 5 last night and we all wished we had just gone to the Grind instead. If this place makes it, it will be a miracle. 
What is good:
Its a really cute space with a nice bar. I was excited when we walked in.
They have wine, and lots of it.
The mashed potatoes and your choice of 3 toppings for them. I love potatoes!

What is not:
The menu is bulky and heavy and requires flipping back and forth between pages. It is also super confusing! 
The chicken is all on the bone.
The sauce you pick is not for dipping, its just what your chicken is cooked in. 
The ""chicken and dumplings"" on the menu is apparently a typo?? Seriously? Our server said they could ""probably make me something like C& D"". Gee, that sounds awesome. 
The one fish selection is served bone in skin on. In a dark restaurant this was really fun for my MIL. Who makes their patrons pay and WORK for their food?? Chick does.
They dont have fries to go with their sandwiches. How many guys do you think want to order a side salad with their sandwich? None of ours did.
The bacon on their cobb salad is like eating bacon flavored rocks. Hard bacon flavored rocks. 
You cannot get un-fried garbanzo beans on the cobb salad, even if you ask for them.
The cobb salad is a sad interpretation of a cobb salad, even if you add chicken.

This bar has it all - it's charming, a little vintage, and serves killer drinks. We tried quite a few of the drinks and not one disappointed us! I ordered the spiked cider for myself and it was like drinking apple pie. I could drink it All. Day. Long. We also tried the Nitro Amaretto Sour and it would make a great dessert! The perfect amount of sweetness, and almond-y goodness. The Dark and Stormy has on-site homemade ginger beer that is so fresh and has a little bite to it. My least favorite drink was the This is a Spicy Drink. It was really, a spicy drink. It starts off cool and refreshing, then there's a little kick at the end. I said this was my least favorite, but that's only because I'm kind of a wimp and don't like spicy things. It was still a great drink, just not up my alley. 
Our service was great. We were there on a Sunday night, and the only patrons in there, but the bartender was very knowledgeable. She gave us great advice, and told us about a local distillery that makes one of the ciders they have on tap.

La Comida has an amazing look from the bar to the dining room, which are all in the same area. I met up with my family here after dinner as they had suggested La Comida for a few drinks before heading out into downtown. I bellied up to the bar and took a look at the margarita menu. I'm not a huge tequila fan so I asked the bartender what her favorite drink was on the menu? ""El Corral"", she replied. Well saddle up partner...let's do this. 

The ""El Corral""  margarita comes with Anejo Tequila, sour mix & Grand Marnier. The drink was refreshing at first and not over powering with the tequila, however, with every sip the drink got sweeter and sweeter. I actually didn't even finish the whole drink, I passed the rest to my GF and ordered a whiskey based margarita. Mmmm, this was super tasty and very interesting. A little Jameson, soda water and a splash of sweet & sour mix. Not on the menu, but if you sweet talk Tanya she might make one for ya. I did try my cousin's drink, the Tamarind margarita, and I liked this one a little bit than my original drink. More salty than sweet.  I'll get you next Tamarind...next time. Muahahahah

I did eat chips and salsa while I was here and I looovvveee me some chips and salsa. The offerings at La Comida are above and beyond. I ordered the Roma Tomato and Habanero salsa which definitely had a kick, but nothing too strong for the palate. I loved this and could have possibly eaten the whole bowl by myself. 

My time in La Comida was brief, but delightful. The younger local ambience was a nice department from the touristy Strip area and sometimes sterile surroundings of Henderson. To quote the Terminator, ""I'll be back!""",2014-08-11 02:54:28

I can't remember their names, but the guy at the counter gave a lot of good suggestions, he answered all my questions very patiently, and after I picked what I liked, he suggested that I try it out in the range.  The instructor I had in the range was also awesome, he taught me all the basics, and tried to make me laugh so I would relax. Even though I ended up not finishing all my shots (I was too chicken, the instructor did everything he could), I really enjoyed the whole experience. Also, since I didn't finish my whole course, at the check out, they also gave me a huge discount, which was totally not necessary! 

Before I went to this place, I was a afraid it might be a tourist trap. Although there were quite a few tourists there, there was a lot of locals there too just to shoot. And they definitely seem to get what type of customer you are, if you know what I mean.

However, our service was absolutely top quality. Our server, Aidan, was always ensuring we had what we wanted and needed. Most of all, he really connected with us and the other tables he was serving, we laughed and joked with him and he treated us like he treated his family...literally, because his family was sitting at the table behind ours!!

We still love it and the food is great. It's one of the only places that reminds me of my first experience of true dim sum back in Calgary introduced to me by a great Asian friend in the late 70's and I thank him to this day.  

The Cart experience is the deal!  Ordering off a menu does not nearly do it for me but back home in Halifax, it's all I have. (Anyone out there listening should pick this idea up and run with it). You get to choose with your eyes and other senses as the carts filled with their selections roll by. I don't even care I don't speak the language - most of the ladies will explain what it is if you ask - and they open the lids off the steamers or other covered dishes so you can see for yourself. I know almost all of them now but love to see ones I haven't tried. I do have my favourites of course like the Har Gow and Shu Mai and my hubbie's steamed pork buns (char Sui boa) but in the end the duck or chicken feet is my all time favourite.  I've made all of these from scratch but man it's a lot of work and is not the same so you soon appreciate this experience!  Please Halifax get a great place like Kim Fung going!  

It's not cheap but it's so worth it and reminds me in a way of Spain and their Tapas. The selection here is great but to get it all you must be patient and relax; chances are you may still miss a favourite and for me this time it was the black bean spare ribs. Note - you can also order anything off the menu or whatever, I think there are items ordered that only the locals know about and I'm super jealous :).  And I've yet to have room left to try the incredible looking noodle dishes - just gives me something to strive for another tine. 

Last note - take ""home"" what you don't finish; a great snack from your  fridge or freeze and have at home for that great daughter who is pet sitting for you and who at the age of 2 visited her first dim sum restaurant and is also addicted to good and true dim sum like at Kim Fung.",2017-06-08 12:16:24

The physical building itself is worn pretty badly and the restaurant could stand too close for a week or so and do a thorough deep cleaning. Varnish peeling of woods, the grout in the floor is filthy and it was actually pretty greasy if you had wet shoes you would slip slide around and it didn't seem very safe.

I don't know what it is about this particular location versus the location and Mentor. The Mentor location seems to be a little bit cleaner well cap. Could do to a holly volume of traffic but a high volume of traffic should also lend itself to a high volume of repair in cleaning. The food itself was neither remarkable nor bad. It was sustenance, plain and simple.  locate rest area he would stop and eat at and then completely forget about it one hour later.

Usually they have great customer service as well, but that was not the case on yesterday at the Henderson location.  I scheduled myself for a fill regular.  The lady at the reception greeted me by saying, ""When is the last time you were here and let me see your lashes"".  This woman literally inspected my lashes to see if I qualified for a fill.  I WAS SO INSULTED AND DEGRADED.  Turns out that they somehow created two separate profiles on me (not my fault) so the lady at the desk did not see that I was a regular at Cherry Lashes since the day the Rainbow location opened.  The record in the account that she pulled up showed that I had not been there since July.  So basically she was accusing me of trying to steal services.  For me this was the equivalent of a store clerk asking me to empty my pockets.

I asked to speak to a manager once I got in the back to show her that I had plenty of lashes from my last visit a few weeks before, which did indeed qualify me for a fill.  On my way out the receptionist apologized for her blunder.  The apology did not take the hurt from the insult away.  She can keep her apology.  The manager was very apologetic and gave me a 50% discount, which I took because I deserved it.  The manager was top shelf.  The receptionist.........questionable if she should be working in customer service.

Cherry, you have the monopoly now.  It is only a matter of time before someone copies your concept and you will find yourselves in deep competition.  It will happen.  Treat your customers appropriately now or you will feel it later.",2014-10-12 12:27:46

The atmosphere is sort of fun-loving with a cute minibar at the front of the restaurant and seating arrangements spanning from patio, main floor and second floor. 

The service is almost non-existant...You have a server appear once and then never again. You are perched or famished or something but no one is in sight...You can hear staff laughter or see them sipping on a beverage while you try to control your own thirst for water or coffee or tea. If you have a table to wait on, why are you not doing so? Of course, I am not suggesting to constantly be on the lookout for what to do for your customers but some semblance of thoughtfulness of bringing over the menu or a glass of water really goes a long way!

The food is inedible. My go to was always the Blueberry Hill. However...Once it was slightly burned which I excused and simply ate. The second time was completely burned. Each pancake was covered in burnt pieces of dough...There was an attempt to conceal it with more blueberry compote but failed miserably. I had asked to replace it and was denied. This ties back to the notion that customers are not the priority here but rather maintaining a relaxed attitude is. Again all we diners ask is that our food is cooked well (or even decently or maybe even considered edible) because we pay for your services and your food. You hurt your customer's trust in your product by displaying certain things and frankly, this is not my recommended anything anymore.",2017-12-03 15:33:52

My first 2 visits to the apple store was to fix my Macbook and both genius bar employees were really helpful and nice (Tyler and Brian). They got the job done and I was out the door. 6 stars for them. The 2nd time that i was there, I told Brian that my phone was acting up and that my phone would only charge until a certain percentage and would shut off every now and then. He told me that it was a software problem and that it had to do something with the charging port. Since I didn't have my phone backed up at the time, he advised me to go home back it up and come back to get it replaced free of charge because I was still under warranty. 

My 3rd visit back, thinking it would go smoothly, made me so frustrated. When I came back, Brian was not working that day and I had to explain the issue to another employee which isn't the problem. This employee totally disregarded everything and blamed me for the phone issue and said it was a physical damage to the phone and that I would be charged $329 for the replacement. He was implying that I purposely broke my phone to get a new one. I told him, I don't even need a replacement and asked if they can just repair it. He said there is nothing he can repair and continued to ask me if i wanted to pay $329 for a new phone. Uh.. HELL TO THE NO. So i asked to get a second opinion by the ""manager"". The employee then disappeared for a couple minutes which I assumed he told the manager his side of the story and then the manager came up to me without picking up my cell phone to inspect it, continued to tell me they can't fix my phone and that it was my fault for plugging in my phone a certain angle which caused the phone to not work properly. Uhh.. the last time I checked, there is only one way to plug in a damn charger. He then proceed to tell me, he can cut the price down in half. Thinking that would make the situation better. Definitely not. 

I drove all the way from Northlake mall to Southpark mall. The employees there then ran some tests and agreed with me that it was a software problem and replaced my phone free of charge within 20 minutes.

That said, I thought I'd give it a whirl for lunch today on my day off. I had to make a full circle through the lot before finding a single space. Walking up, I could already hear the buzz of way too many overly excited female voices. Ruh roh. The line stretched well out the door, but it did move quickly. Employees are stationed at the doorway before the registers to answer questions, a nice touch. Said helpful girl directed me to a little side register devoted to take out. 

To (ahem) ensure my experience was representative, I splurged for the 3-item mix + match, a big ol' drink, and a brownie (after sampling one at the register). $23.... ouch. I had elbows-out trying to get through the crowd to the drink station (ice teas, lemonades, etc.). Predictable mix of ladies-who-lunch, hipsters, soccer moms, fashionistas in leather shirts and $2000 handbags. Female:male ratio easily 4:1, if not higher. The decor is a little whitewashed-Midwestern-barn-chic for my taste, but it fits the name. It's quite open so the place is LOUD AS FUCK. 

I barely had a chance to get comfy on the big benches in the takeaway area before my food was ready, presented in a brown paper bag with a cute artichoke stamped on it, a takeout menu thoughtfully placed inside. I'd just finished checking out the cooler with to-go drinks, mentally scoffing at the $6 cold brew coffee and envisioning the idiot who would think it's cool to drink coconut water right out of the coconut. I fled the scene, trying not to step on wayward children, and hurried to my car as someone in a big SUV stalked me for my space. 

The verdict? Meh. The dark greens were very salty. VERY. The chili glazed sweet potato was decent, with an unexpected pronounced citrus flavor. Not spicy in the least. The tofu... well, it is tofu. Definitely nothing special. The clear winner was the sweet corn and quinoa. My God. Strap a feed bag on me full of that shit and I'll be good. The portions are not as dismal as one might suspect from other reviews; this will be two meals. The brownie was puzzling; different from the one I'd sampled earlier, although I'd ordered the same type. The one that came home with me was, again, heavily salted. Not bad, just not expected.

The place isn't overwhelming like some gyms, but that also means it's not huge. Don't get me wrong, there are PLENTY of treadmills and ellipticals here. In fact, they're pretty fancy ones too. TVs on each screen, which you can hook your ipod up to or just watch reruns of Paula Deen on the Food Network simply to be evil to yourself. This gym always seems to try to be improving its machines and weights, which is nice. 

My biggest problems would be that there's only one shower in the ladies changing rooms and it drains awfully. The water doesn't stay in and it rolls all the way over to my shoes, plus there's nowhere for me to hang a towel. My other problem is that their check-in system is terrible. I've tried many times to check-in via fancy fingerprint .007 whatever that thing is, but every time I'm left awkwardly telling the person behind the counter my name. They stare into the computer screen, clicking.... clicking.... clicking.... Then they look at me as if to say 'What are you still doing here?' ugh.

With my Groupon, I got a couple free sessions with a personal trainer and I was wary. Personal trainers at gyms will push you, HARD, for your business. Regardless, I decided to try it out. I actually got some great advice and workout ideas. He also showed me how to use a lot of the machines that I'd always been scared to try. In the interim, we discussed my schedule and monetary situation, and he didn't hard sell me once. At the end of our final session, he just packed in all the knowledge he could pass on to me about any exercises that might benefit me in my own personal workout time and encouraged me to ask any employee on the floor in the future if I had any questions about the machines we hadn't gone over. Loved that! And now that I have a new work schedule, I'm actually considering what I never would have considered in the past: a personal trainer! His lack of pressure was such a breath of fresh air. 

The Zumba group classes are fun and the weekday instructor, Sandra, is energetic and encouraging. I wish they had barre classes on the weekend or on weekdays in the early afternoons because I'd love to take advantage of those! Barre is the new big thing and I really hope they expand that class.

If you're going for good quality sushi then this is not the place. Too be honest, most AYCE places do not serve high quality fish, so that's my fault. My food also took a very long time, rest of the family who didn't order AYCE was already finished by the time I got my first order of sushi.
Next, the staff sat a completely belligerent and very drunk guy next to us, then sat some very angry teens on the other side of us whose every other word was the f word. The restaurant was empty so seating us in between these two groups of individuals made the whole experience so much worse than it should have been. Based on food alone we would have tried again but based on the type of people who come here, we just can't risk it. Also, we walked into a cloud of cigarette smoke the manager was smoking right outside the restaurant doors. Maybe your experience will be different but we will not be back.",2017-07-30 01:18:11

Right before Xmas my oldest sister and I were doing some late shopping at Home Goods and she suggested this place after hearing good things from her friends.  It was late when we got there but we were sat w/o a problem.  We even checked to make sure it was okay bc some of the tables already had the chairs put up on them, but we were assured it was not a problem at all.

Our server was nice and good since we were his only table.  We each had a glass of wine and started with shumai and calamari at the servers suggestion.  Both were great.  The calamari was served with a sweet chilli sauce, but it was was to spicy for wimpy old me.  We then split 2 rolls, California and shrimp tempura I think.  Both were good and fresh, not the best ever but definitely would order again.  And finally I had been craving yaki soba so we got that with just vegetables and I liked it a lot.  Nice and fresh tatsting, not overpowered with sauce or too salty.  We also each had another glass of wine.

What I like about this place is that you can always find good values here.....sure its made in China, but hey, if I use it just ONCE, then it has served its purpose. I am not sure that I would buy a generator here, or anything that my life may depend on, but for a one time job, or for those who need a few tools to get started to earn money to buy real tools, then this is the place.

I have found that this place can be addictive, search for the sales, be patient, then use that almighty 20% off coupon in the paper and automotive magazines, and it keeps bringing you back.

I have found myself stopping by here twice a day sometimes....( I may need to seek professional help for that), but believe me, this place is worth the visit.

I like TJ's concept: a small foot print of a store offering good stuff at great prices.  I like that you can feel free to try out stuff here.   If you don't like it, they give you your money back.  How do you like that?   I just learned that the other day when taking about TJ beer with a staff member.  Service is always awesome and knowledgable.  Prices generally cannot be beat.

My personal favs: ladyfingers, wasabi seaweed crisps, rosemary raisin crackers (with their goat cheese), eggs (they are always fresh with orange yolks), chocolate covered pretzels, butternut squash raviolis, salsas, sparkling water, Greek yogurt.  This list could go for awhile.

They also have cheap avocados, papaya, and KerryGold butter.

Both were on the same type of bun - old school, nice soft, melt in your mouth variety, which we thought worked perfectly with our burgers.

We went on to order Buttermilk Meatball with Grits (creamiest grits I every eat), Catfish Gremolata with Okra Succotash, and Sal Focaccia, all very delicious. Can't wait to visit Okra again. One tip-waitstaff needs to leave their cell phones in the back until breaks. Bartender had to whistle to the waitress to come get my drink and bring it to me.",2016-05-21 03:13:55

It's been over a month since getting my new home and I have yet to get keys to my mailbox for which they say takes 7-10 days. Initially we were told 7-10 weeks and after speaking with a supervisor who informed us the former counter person was incorrect and that they were processing our order only to come in 2 weeks later and they knew of no such key placement order request causing us to put in yet another order and wait another 7-10 days. If that's not the kicker, upon putting in a key request you fill out a mail hold request and are told your mail is available for pickup for the next 30 days yet every time I stop by this crazy place and stand in line for an hour or more they say they don't have mail for me! So I find myself staking out my mailman a few times out the week just to beg him for my mail. Should I catch him on a BAD day, well let's just say I not only don't get my mail, but I also get yelled at for even asking such a thing! As if that is bad even BEFORE they open their phone line goes busy and is busy ALL DAY until they close. You can't get a hold of this office via phone even if you tried.

Food is stellar pub grub. Coconut shrimp and artichoke dip is our favorite. We asked for tortilla chips instead of pita for the dip - just a smile and no upcharge.

I was first served a bowl of broth with a few veggies(see pics) it was good.

I ordered the Red Curry with Tofu (see pics)
I thought it was OK, it was mostly bamboo shoots and peppers with tofu, there were only two green beans and 4 very small pieces of eggplant in there. 
Kinda disappointing after the abundance of veggies I've gotten at other places.

Another bummer is they don't serve you that yummy little egg-roll with your meal either.
I was really looking forward to that, so I ordered them separately (see pics) and they were not as good as I hoped.

No choice of soup or salad , you just get soup and No egg-roll. So while it wasn't bad, It wasn't fabulous either.

I met a friend there and since it was HH we decided to start off with a pitcher of beer.  I swear this was the largest pitcher I have ever ordered and it was a good thing I had someone who would have a glass with me.  But there was no way we could finish the last of it.  There was probably another 16 oz glass left.
We started off with an appetizer.  Best bruschetta I ever have had.  There had to be at least 2 inches of diced tomatoes on the top just perfectly seasoned.  It would be a great appetizer for 4 people or just enough for 2 without ordering anything else.
We ordered a small pizza which would really feed 3 or 4 people.  It was a deep dish with fresh mushrooms and pepperoni. There were 6 extra large slices in this pie.  We each ended up taking home 2 pieces each.  Now I have 2 more delicious meals.
I would really recommend just one or 2 extra toppings so that you get the taste of pizza rather than the toppings.

There are HUGE windows in the front of the space that look out onto Reynolds street, a gorgeous little slice of this cute little neighborhood nestled into the middle of the East End. 

My only complaint about this place is that it closes daily at 5pm. I have closed this place down multiple times, and it always seems odd.

We had to wait 45 minutes to be seated, I have no problem because they have a bar with some great beer choices at reasonable prices. What I did have a problem with was that they use a computer based system that will text you what your wait time is once you arrive and give them your telephone number. I waited exactly 45 minutes until I received a text that my table was ready. Not 40 or 50 minutes but exactly 45 minutes which is what I was told by the waitstaff upon arrival. I find that interesting, is it a scam to get you to go to the bar and spend more? Something to think about. The few wines they offer(2) they will pour a generous $6 glass.

Once we were seated at one of their high top tables. We were sweating our tails off because they had the garage door entrance to the patio area wide open. It is 95 degrees out and if I wanted to dine outside I would have asked to be seated in the patio area or stayed home and grilled my own burger. The burger was A-OK for this reason, way overcooked. Was by no means moist or juicy. It did have overall good flavor but, to have a truly awesome burger int needs to be both seasoned properly and also show that some skill and care was taken to actually heat that hunk of meat to perfection. The ingredients burgatory have are obviously top notch but honestly what's the point if you cant cook the the meat properly.

This place is great! This was my first experience with a pizza place using the order-at-the-counter concept like this, and I was thoroughly impressed. This particular location is nice and open. You order at the counter and can get pretty much whatever you'd want on your pizza or salad. I got a pizza and a small side salad to go with it.

You order your sauce, meats, veggies, and cheese at the counter. I didn't see anything limiting the number of toppings, but they did seem to be pretty careful about the amount of any particular topping that you get. There is a nice variety of everything, with many options for all of the sauces, meats, veggies, and cheeses. They put it all together in front of you, and then they throw it in the oven. Because the crusts are nice and thin, it only takes a few minutes for the pizzas to cook. We had our pizzas at our table before I even finished my small salad that I had taken back and started eating immediately after paying for the meal.

The pizza itself was great! I had put together a chicken pesto and veggies pizza that I really enjoyed. The thin crust had a great texture to it, and the toppings all had good flavor. Add some crushed red pepper to that, and you've got a great pizza. Because it was cooked fresh, it came out nice and hot, with cheese stretching from the slice to mouth with each bite. I ate the whole pizza and was pretty satisfied with the size.

The salad was tasty as well. It made for a nice starter, and considering the choices you have, it's well-priced. Between the salad and pizza, I was probably a little more full than I normally like, but nothing too uncomfortable.

This is a fantastic option for pizza by yourself or for pizza with choosy people who can't agree on toppings. Pretty darn good, and the price is certainly right.",2015-09-11 04:04:22

They don't really explain much, kind of expect you to know what comes on each sandwich and you really have to tell them if you want to hold or add something.

We got a pitcher of Sapporo to start and ordered pad thai and green curry. Both had good spice, and an authentic thai taste of specific spices (ie. no ketchup lol) I asked for medium spice on the green curry and it came out nice and hot. My friend said he really enjoyed the pad thai and it was one of the better ones he's had. Definitely no Khao San Rd but it was pretty good for dt thai.

The process of checking-in, going through security, and getting into your seat are all on a timeline. Sometimes we're rushed, sometimes we're way early, and sometimes we're right on the money. 

I tend to be the first of these three... I usually snooze twice, take my time showering, and forget that I have to put gas in the rental or time the subway the night before. Where do these all play into this review?... 

Well, Cleveland Hopkins Airport has the WORST security checkpoint at that I have ever encountered (@ American Airlines gates). Now, I only went through one of the three TSA checks, but that's good enough to make the above statement. The line was extremely long, with no place to go as the roped off area held 20 people max.

The lamb gyro, the spanakopita, the salad, the steak souvlaki, the shamali, for all that is good in the world, come here and try them all! 

Seriously.  

I cannot express enough how good the food is here.  The rice pilaf, the rice is loose and flavorful and filling.  The spanakopita is fluffy and dense at the same time (yeah, I don't how that happens, but yes, just yes).  The souvlaki, oh, hello super flavorful and rich meatiness on a skewer.  The salad, there is something addictive about the dressing, and I really appreciate the olives having the pit.  The gyro, well, this is how most people judge a Greek place, and I can say that it is flavorful (everything in this place is flavorful, you cannot go wrong), sliced at just the right thickness, and just works so well with the tzaziki, vegetables, and pita.  

Oh and the shamali, dense poundcake like with an orange infused in it, a great way to end a meal.

My sister recommended this place due to great reviews on Yelp.  This place is in a plaza and it's hard to find since the sign is mainly in Korean.  There's free parking in the plaza but very limited.  If you can't find parking you have to resort to street meter parking.  They don't take reservations here and the wait can range from 15 mins to 1 hour long.  I would recommend when you're 15 mins away call them and leave your phone number to hold a place in line. They really do call you back when your table is ready.  If you have a party of 2 it's easier to get a table fast.  As you can see from the pictures the place is tiny.  The ventilation system is not that great so you'll leave smelling like you were at a Korean bbq place!  They have there cute barrel stools that you sit on but also forms as a jacket and purse storage. You can put all you stuff in the barrel then put the cushion lid back on and voila you have a stool!  They give you amazing appetizers.  You get the shredded green onion salad which you put the spicy sauce on but you can use it for your lettuce wrap.  It also comes with Kim chi, spicy radish and sour jalapeño peppers with onions.  The meal also comes with a pot of steamed whipped eggs and Kim chi soup.  We ordered an extra vegetarian Bi bim boo, stone pot rice.  For our meat we ordered the steak skirt and pork belly.  The meat quality was great and lean.  There was a lot of food for the two of us. So stuffed at the end. The service is amazing.  No matter how busy the servers were they would always get you what you needed really fast when you ask for side dish and lettuce wrap refills.  This place is authentic and amazing.  It my 4th time here but it won't be my last.  I highly recommend this place if you're craving for Korean BBQ. It's not the cheapest place but for the quality and the amount of food you get I say it's well worth it.

White Sangria $33
~ white wine, lillet, mixed apple cider & poached apple, lemongrass reduction
~ Love this, it's definitely one of the best I had in the city. It was so light and refreshing, love all the flavor which wasn't too sweet or citrus-cy.

Pan Con Tomate ~ Spanish Anchovies $6
~ This couldn't have been better, you won't believe how good toasted house baked bread with crushed tomato and olive oil can get. 
~ Simple at it's best and the anchovies just made it all that much better.

Jambon Iberico De Bellota $30
~ 36 month Acon-fed Black Hoof Iberico Ham
~ This is the finest type of Jambon Iberico which is made from free-range pigs that roam the oak forest and each only acorn (bellota). 
~ The exercise and diet gave the 36 months cured ham so much flavor and the right amount of fat.
~  It was def a splurge on our part for brunch but we just had to taste it for ourselves to see what make it so pricey.

 Iluevos Cocidos Con Esparragos Blancos, Jambon Serrano Y Espuma de Quesco Manchego $13
~ poached eggs, white asparagus, Jambon Serrano, Manchego
~ This was a rather simple dish but every components are so perfect.... it was nothing special but yet so good. 
~ I wouldn't mind going back and have another one of this.

Habas Con Chorizo $8
~ House chorizo & braised beans
~ Even though I am not a big bean fan, I loved this dish.

 Leche Frita Con Helado de Azafron $7
~ Fried mild, Saffron Ice Cream, Honey
~ This was way sweeter than I expected and I actually prefer the texture and taste of the Chinese Version which is more milky rather than custardy here.

 The cleavers on the wall spell out ""Full Stomach, Happy Heart"" in Spanish

 Verdict:
~ Love this place, will def come back for dinner real soon
~ Simple Delicious Dishes, nothing to pretentious 
~ Can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu",2013-07-16 02:08:13

The rice and  beans were right on too. The only reasons for the minus one star is the  bathroom was a bit rough and could have been cleaner (especially since we were the first customers today) and it'd be good to have chips as an option since they have all the ingredients readily available on the menu (salsa and corn tortillas) already. Also it was very warm in the dining room but perhaps the mesquite fired grill is overpowering the AC.

We took the plunge and invited another couple (the wife is itslian!) And went on a Saturday night. 

Happy hour is M-Sat until 6:30pn. ALL beer is $3, house wine by the glass is $4 (and it is decent!), and 7 or 8 apps are $8. The waiter (and actually all staff) were friendly and helpful. We decided to order the meatball app and butternut squash ravioli app. The regular fried calamari, and seafood stuffed mushrooms. They brought facascia bread with evoo and balsamic vinegar and freshly grated cheese that was very tasty. All of our food came out at the same time and was piping hot. I really enjoyed the meatball app, never seen it done like that. Would make a great appetizer for a party. My husband thought the calamari was a little heavily breaded, but I thought it was tender and the marinara was very good. The ravioli were delish, especially the sauce, but a tad al dente. The stuffed mushrooms were ahhhhmazing! They were a special for the night. They brought 10 small mushrooms stuffed with seafood in another fabulous sauce! The men were still hungry so they ordered a seafood plate entre, another special.  We got another round of drinks while happy hour prices were still available.  The seafood plate was a delightful treat!  Shrimp, scallops, and salmon arranged on grilled sliced vegetables (tomatoes, eggplant and zucchini ) beautifully presented and seasoned nicely. The salmon was NOT dried out or over cooked.  The shrimp had a little bit of that lovely grilled taste. Didn't care for the grilled (regular) eggplant as the skin was left on and was tough/bitter. I LOVE grilled Asian eggplant, one of my absolute favorites, so that is a change I would make. Prices were reasonable. Staff friendly, wasn't too loud, nice and clean and charming. Want to go back and order entrees with more of their delicious sauces!! Let's see how I feel when I get in bed :)",2016-04-24 04:05:02

I always get one of each roll, and this place being a steak spouse I got the Kobe beef. It is evident from the food that they take pride in what they cook, how they serve it, and in the over all satisfaction of the customer. The rolls were superb, I got the spicy tune and salmon, the California, the vegetables tempura, and shrimp tempura. The dishes came out in a timely manner.

Okay fine... understandable, stuff happens. 15 min wait? No problem I'll wait. Lady walks in behind me gets told the same thing, she looks a little upset but whatever, gotta wait just like me.  What bothers me is when I come back 20 min later expecting my order to be ready and chicken is nowhere near cooked, and the lady that was behind me already got her order and left!!! Did you just give away my food? Ended up waiting 35minutes for some 'fast food chicken.' Sure was fast. 

Staff/Service: The cashier at the front seemed nice and seemed to care but the rest of the staff seemed absent minded. Whats worse, David Adjey was around and nobody even seemed to be working hard at all to push out orders.

Food: You'd think the long wait for the freshly roasted chicken would of been worth it? Not at all. Chicken was dry, underseasoned.... bland....The only thing worth getting here is the potato salad, which tasted pretty good. But a takeout chicken restaurant with bad chicken???? Gimme a break. 1.5stars/5 but I'll give it a 2 just because of the potato salad. 

Conclusion: Not coming back again for sure and would not recommend. Whole chicken + 2 sides for 24 bucks... If it had been amazing or even half good, I would pay that price, but not for this crap.

You go in and sign a clipboard to get on the waiting list. There is a window for passport services, but whoever works there doesn't just process passports. If the line for regular customers gets long, they stop passport services and deal with the regular customers first, so if it's a busy day you are SOL.

Surprising, this donut shop is a standalone building that has a drive thru and caters to fully hungry patrons by offering crossaint style sandwiches. The seating area was probably as big as a b grade chains dining area like del taco or Arby's. 

The menu shows a picture of every donut they make and they are all 99 cents or less. Apple fritters and cinnamon rolls are my favorite so I was a bit worried they wouldn't have it. Well, they did. They have them in a mini size which is about the same size as a standard glazed donut. They also have stuffed donut holes with blueberry raspberry and Boston creme. They even have chocolate donut holes. 

I ended up doing 4 donuts and eating 2 so far for only about $4. I chose to try the standard glazed and the Apple fritter first and man were they good. They weren't overly buttery and tasted fresh even though it was already 530pm at that point. They had pretty consistent traffic of customers and the gal working was fast and friendly with everyone.

Call it what you will, but Monkey Pants is and will always be one of my favorite bars in Tempe. I love this place because it's a bar that reminds its customers that they can let loose and not take themselves so seriously. Customers are also kindly reminded that they can receive a free shot just for showing off a little skin during the 1 o'clock shirtless shot! It's nonsense like this that made me a regular here, and it's nonsense like this that will always encourage me to bring my friends here for a good time.

The Pants isn't all about wackiness though, they take a few things seriously, like their food. A lot of the menu is typical bar fare, but there are a few things that stand out. In an attempt to cater to the influx of new-to-town transplants, they have burgers named by their state of influence. I definitely nod in the direction of the New Mexico, the Arizona and the Georgia burgers. They are all amazing, and if you're feeling silly, go for the Alaskan burger...that's sure to make your server (or Chris the bartender) chuckle. Next up, The Pants' ranch. They seriously need to bottle that and sell it. That ranch is the tastiest that I've ever had, and when paired with the fries, it's what the French would call, ""Bueno!"" ...or something like that. The ranch can also be paired with some pretty delicious hot wings as well. If you decide to go with those, get them charred on the grill with extra sauce!

In my opinion, any night is a good night for M Pizzy. But, if I had to choose a couple to recommend, they would be Wednesday for Wig Wednesday (happy hour prices from 8pm until close if you wear a wig...which are provided...and $2 off burgers) and Thursday ($5 hot dog special, live comedy and goldfish races after 10pm).

So when I saw the Groupon for brunch I bought it right away!
This visit was such a disappointment and I get increasingly frustrated when you go to a restaurant with a promo and they treat you like inferior customers in light of the coupon...I'm sure they expect a lower bill and lower tip but when they start with 'attitude' and the service is below par...well, the lower tip just follows!
We were seated outside by request and it was very busy and somewhat hot! 
Love their bread so when they brought the ONE little loaf it was gone immediately...the waiter came and we asked for more bread to go with the Charcuterie platter (which was part of the Groupon) and asked for the platter with meat and cheese to which he replied "" that's what you're getting!""
We actually DID want more to drink than the one mimosa that came with the cert but he took all the menus right away, never offered the mimosa special or anything else to drink although we did order a glass of wine each to enjoy with our meals.
We both had the Benedict's, they were pretty good but the best was the charcuterie platter that we would've enjoyed more with bread, even though we asked two more times it never came.
The discount with the Groupon was really NOT that much and the fact it seemed to create such an attitude was annoying.

My husband and I went Saturday afternoon to pick out a glider or rocker for our baby room.  Immediately we were greeted by Loni.  She is a cute lady with a short bob that is gilded by bright purple and let me tell you it looks good on her!  She was super sweet and helpful and really patient with me (I am picky and I had been set on a rocker from Pottery Barn Kids that my husband nixed.)  Loni went over chairs with me and what features they had.  I asked her to show me electric rockers and I liked electric better.  Then she went over fabrics with me and colors and this is where all her patience was spent!  lol.  She knew I wanted grey and helped find me a soft swatch called Sterling.  I kept looking as I thought it might be too dark.  My husband kept insisting this was the color that we wanted!  I wanted maybe a cotton fabric with stripes but the store designer said that stripes would not be done on a chair with gathered fabric because it would look like a wavy mess, and that cotton is not as durable or long-lasting as some other fabrics.  Okay she had points.  Eventually I saw a chair in the perfect grey and asked about it!  Well come to find out it was Sterling grey... So I guess my husband and Loni found me the right color from the start.  lol.  What can I say?  With the sale going on the one electric rocker/recliner cost $1100.  That price also includes fabric protection and a box of cleaner in case my baby spits up on the chair (or worse.)  I loved working with Loni and I will ask for her next time.  I will tell you why I deducted one star from my experience though- because while Loni was helping my husband and I two people kept asking her if she was ""ok"" helping us as if she needed their help.  I don't care if she is new, it seemed embarrassing that they didn't trust her to help us enough.  It was also annoying because I didn't like either of those two people.  One might have been the manager- he just seemed like a know-it-all and was trying to explain things to us that I didn't care about or he was just making assumptions that I wanted to tell him off for.  Example of this would be that the manager said things about what would happen to the glider afterwards and if it'd be going downstairs in our family room.  No it wouldn't and I don't need to discuss this with you!  I'm not going to go acting like a brat and shouldn't need to explain to you how many rooms in our house we have and what I plan to do with my chair once my baby is a toddler etc.  I'm not stupid I have enough common sense to plan what to do with my furniture.  Nancy was OK but her interrupting Loni was annoying because I just liked Loni better and she was the only one I cared to be helped by.  Just let Loni do her job people- I think she is more the competent and friendly enough to handle business on her own!",2015-02-16 19:33:50

This is a very popular restaurant and the hostesses know it.  

On one occasion I was told the wait was an hour without reservations.  Its all good.  I asked if the hostess could take my mobile number and call me if the table opened sooner.  She pointed at the hostess stand and loudly declared ""do you see any telephone here?""

The second try, I made reservations for 8pm.  Arrived with my party on time then proceeded to wait 45 minutes.  I guess its all good since everyone else with reservations was also waiting.

Once inside, the food and service deliver.

Pizzas are great way to start the meal, epically the ""Del Lupo"".  Be sure to share.  They are very large.  All salads should also be shared unless you are eating it as a main.

Pastas are very good but it is the seafood risotto that is the true standout.

The choices tend to be a bit older and more conservative. I may be a lawyer, but good God I do not want to dress like one all the time. However, if you need a polo shirt, this is your place. 

That said, the shoe dept. is amazing. They have a full range of sizes and will order it for you if they do not have it in your size for free. I have child-sized feet, so this is super helpful as Nordstroms is often the only place I can find shoes in my size that do not prominently feature cartoon characters. I lurve me some hot shoes, and this place always has them. 

The beauty dept is also pretty great. Heaven for a make-up queen like me! Nordstrom carries lots of brands, including some smaller beauty brands that are harder to find. The MAC counter here is the best in town - the staff are friendly and helpful. Though I am an ardent MAC girl, I often find myself standing in their branded stores unable to get anyone's attention...Not so at the Nordstrom's MAC counter. They also have a large fragrance section, though it lacks the depth one would hope for and mainly deals in major designer brands. 

Finally, Nordstroms does have a really cool service tied to their website that is worth mentioning. If you find something on their website you can check to see if it is available in store. If it is, you can buy it online and pick it up in the store, totally avoiding shipping costs. This is a great feature for last minute gifts and can save a ton of time and legwork...which may be important b/c those beautiful shoes are not always made for walking...",2008-12-10 16:54:02

The restaurant is clean, the lighting is bright and the place is very well-decorated but Lee's has the most disappointing prices, grills on the tables and customer service! It was Mother's Day and you'd think they'd be prepared for a huge crowd but I suppose not. We were seated promptly but did not get help for the next 20 or so minutes. We were a party of 8 and it was our first time dining at Lee's. We finally put in our orders and the first batch of food was delicious. The meats were flavorful and spicy. 

We were ready for round 2 and when we politely asked the server if we are able to order, she brushed us off rudely saying, ""Hold on! I'm the only server!"" Sheesh, sorry for being an inconvenience! This happened several times during lunch and really rubbed us the wrong way. We asked for food, waters, sides, napkins.. things that are normally asked for but we felt like we shouldn't or couldn't ask for them. 

One example is we asked for one more Steamed Egg and Soup and she goes, ""You already have two."" Yes, we are aware of that. But they're delicious, it's AYCE and there were 8 of us so.. I mean.. we thought we could ask for more. We asked for chicken because she walked away before we could finish our order and she said, ""Finish your meats first then I'll bring it.""

Honestly, the delicious food does not compensate for the extremely poor customer service.  We had one grill on our table that was located to the very right of the table so the patrons seated on the left had to wait for the cooked meats from the people seated on the right side. The prices are ridiculous for the horrible treatment you get from the workers. The server eventually got nicer at the end when it got less busy and by that time, we were ready to depart already.

All in all, that will be my first and last time at Lee's. I'd rather eat Korean BBQ from somewhere else after my experience.",2015-05-13 03:34:15

They also pack quite a few booths and tables into the restaurant while still maintaining spaciousness and privacy.

A friend and I ordered four rolls - the Spider Roll, Philadelphia Roll (my favourite), Dragon Roll, and Rainbow Roll. These were great - absolutely no complaints with the food. They were, however, a little on the pricy side, especially when factoring in location.

You take a stroll into either a walk-in cooler or a backroom lined with every beer under the sun, pick what you want and toss it into the complimentary cooler. This nifty little guy chills your bottle to whatever your desired temp is, fast! We're talking like 3-5 minutes. If it were just for the insanely intricate brew selection, D's would be a 5'er star, period.

Now, let's move on to some serious dog biz-nas. This place was recommended to me from a frank-lovin' Pittsburgh-ite as the best place in town to grab one. Welp, I ordered my very first Chicago-style hotdog and was not disappointed. In fact, holy-fantastic-hot-peppers! The toppings were all so delish and blended perfectly with the dog. It was cooked just right on the outside, inside and served up with a freshly steamed bun. Yum. We also skipped the fries and enjoyed a baked, soft pretzel instead. This thing was fluffy, chewy and delectable. 

The only thing I would ask for more of is maybe a heftier frank. Don't get me wrong--everything was beyond delicious. I just noticed there wasn't much meatiness involved, and with all those topping options you want the hot dog to stand out too. 

Besides that, the atmosphere, help and general vibe of this little joint was spot-on. If you're in the 'Burgh, you must stop by D's. Seriously.",2011-02-16 22:47:14

First, their yogurt flavors are so unique. They are always switching it up - my favorites are the Red Velvet Cake, Pistachio, and...drumroll please....Chocolate Coconut Truffle! YUM!  

Then, you have their extensive topping bar. They have more fresh fruit options than nearly any other place I've been...including Kiwi, Blackberries, Strawberries, and even Lychee fruit! I've never seen Lychee anywhere else. You can tell the fruit is freshly cut; not from a can, like at some other places *cough*yogurtini*cough*

Besides the fruit, they have pretty much everything else you could ever want; oreos, reeses, heath bar, butterfinger, all kinds of nuts, even those circus animal cookies! Like the yogurt, the toppings change daily (and I'm sure seasonally as well, especially the fruit), but I am always able to find something I love.

I loved all the meat, but my favorite was the pineapple. It was glazed in Cinnamon and warmed. Fantastic.

We thought they were abandoned by previous customers. Not that $2.50 is a lot of money for playing board games; they had a very limited selection of only three board games and some of them looked worn out.

More indoor seating, staff bring you you're food, nicer dinnerware, and tractor soda bar inside (no more bees yay). I've tried many of their burgers and they're okay--others really enjoy them. I personally go for the garlic fries and the REAL milkshakes. Seriously two best menu items. The garlic fries leave you stinky, but definitely satisfied. The milkshakes are the size of an adult forearm and come fully equipped with whipped cream and cherry and are so worth the $5.50. I always get strawberry--which is made with real strawberries not the fake stuff like other places. The atmosphere is friendly and inviting and great for families. Watch out on Friday's, as you will be greeted with a line out the door because they're that good. I recently tried the buffalo chicken sandwich and found a new favorite! Perfect balance of grill flavor and spice. Next time I hope to try their pizza. You won't be disappointed here. When it's cooler, enjoy the beautiful grounds outside. The story behind this place is very magical, too so don't forget to watch the story on the tv while you wait in the line to order.",2018-05-10 18:58:45

I checked this place out in the summer, so I took advantage of the patio out front.  I can't remember what was going on, but Front street was closed off for an event so it was fun to people watch.  

The service was alright, nothing special.  While the patio was nice, the decor inside was very cheap looking.  

We tried the Mexican Poutine to start.  It was essentially fries with a soggy pile of mush on top.  No flavour, not that hot, and not very tasty.  For dinner I had the beef enchilada dinner.  The portions were large, but I would have been fine if they were small so I didn't feel like I was wasting so much food, as I didn't eat most of it.  It came with bland Mexican rice and beans.  The enchilada itself wasn't very good.  Very bland as well and the beef was quiet dry.  For the price that we paid I was not impressed.  It was way too expensive and the food was sub-par.  

I would recommend staying away from this place if you're looking for some good Mexican food.",2012-03-06 18:43:08

the iconic Pittsburgh breakfast spot in the strip. People rave about this place and Pamelas, and to both i wonder why? 

I see lines of people waiting outside of Deluca's and I wonder how many of these are returning customers or people just inspired by the novelty.

This is not to say its bad, but it IS overrated.

My better half and I both arrived with starving appetites, and the portions were very generous. I give them kudos for prompt service in the malestrom of customers. The menu options are diverse and unique. Perhaps if I try more I could revamp my opinion.

I ordered a concoction of fried chicken, gravy, home fries and scrambled eggs. It was greasy and tasty, but maybe my expectations were too high? Perhaps I have also been spoiled by similar food elsewhere in Pittsburgh that remains off the beaten path and for half the price. Thanks Delucas, it was fun, but its me...not you.

The outdoor patio is nice too but during a recent visit here a group of friends filled up one section of the patio and had bad service (I think the waitress was new as well) ... and to make it worse, when the last of our food was delivered (1.5 hrs after it was ordered) the waiter delivering it had the gawl to start arguing with us about the actual time we arrived there and ordered and then mummbled on about how our group was too big for that area... bad move on his part. Another waitress came out later who was very nice and cheery and she tried to remedy the situation but we already felt burned... A large part of our group WERE regulars but I can see that changing after this recent experience.

So I would still reccomend this place but keep the groups on the smaller side and stay indoors if you want good service.

The taste that makes you want to eat healthy for every meal. 

At first I thought the price was a little high, but now I am more than happy to pay the price. It's a much healthier alternative to ice cream. I could honestly eat this for every meal of summer. Also, it is GMO free!

It is one of the only breweries in Charlotte that has their own food and not a food truck. I went with my family from out of town that wanted to have some local beer but also eat so we chose here. 

The waitress was clearly new as she didn't know what the specials were. She also wasn't sure of what kind of vodka they had in their bar (one of the party doesn't like beer). They have a full bar and have brunch cocktails however they didn't have their special bloody mary on their menu. It seemed odd as it was prime time on Saturday and not to have a special doesn't seem like good business. 

I got the beer cheese burger and a beer. They were both okay. Their beer selection is a bit odd and nothing that really screams YES this is what I want to drink. The burger was over cooked and tasted like the grill. I've heard good things about their beer cheese however on my burger it was lumpy, didn't have much of a flavor to it and was room temp. Everyone else I went with enjoyed their food. Some one else had The Quesadilla said it tasted good and it looked amazing. If I were to go back I will try that.",2018-07-18 01:50:34

We decided to take a drive down here to possibly get a pumpkin for our son and to partake in some of the activities.  We pulled up and found a parking spot way in the back lot.  To their credit, they do have a ton of parking.  We made our way up to the entrance and noticed a few things.

1.  This isn't really a pumpkin patch.  It's some barrels of hay with pumpkins sitting on top of them.
2.  The pumpkins themselves were all ghetto.  A majority of them were deformed, dented, rotting and just didn't look like a typical pumpkin.
3.  The setup of this place is horrible!  You have about a foot of space to walk through, all the while, the line to purchase your pumpkin was snaking through the area as well.  One huge clusterfuck!  We lasted about 5 minutes.  Horrible layout!
4.  This place isn't in the ""hood"" per say, but the people that were mulling out and about were super white trash.  Reminded me of the El Cajon trolley station...if you know where that is, and know what kind of people hang around there, it describes what we saw here today perfectly.  I saw multiple chicks in daisy dukes and Ugg boots as well as tons of people pawning their kids off to their spouse so that they could light up their cigarette.  Anyways...who am I to judge, right? ;-)
5.  We never even made it inside for the ""activities"".  Entrance was $9.00 from what it looked like and then all the other fun was extra $$.  Like I said earlier, we lasted there about 5 minutes.  

I would never come back.....not even during the week when nobody is there.  It was a wasted drive down here and I have no idea why people would ever want to come here.  There has to be better pumpkin patches in Arizona, right?  I sure as hell hope so.  This one was whack!",2015-10-17 22:13:13

I'm a busy gal but that's no excuse, I just didn't realize they have such phenomenal hours! They are open 7 days a week, Monday through Saturday 10-9 Sunday 10-7pm. 
 I honestly was expecting the typical ""massage parlor"" experience, the initial awkwardness of  deciding how much of your clothes you want to slip off before you partially slide under a sheet, trying not to lose that same sheet as you roll over,a dainty fingered massage you can barely feel even after requesting a deep tissue massage, feeling like you didn't really get your hours worth. 
 QC Reflexology lets you leave your clothes on, (comfy clothes recommended) except for your socks and shoes. They put your naked feet in a warm bath of detoxification all while beginning what was no less than a head to toe heavenly rub down! 
Tina was my masseuse extraordinaire and let me tell you she knows the artistry of massage! I can't wait to return, and you can't beat the price at $25 for your first hour visit and there's a Yelp check in offer as well!

The happy hour is only at the bar and patio but the bar tables have comfortable couches and huge tables. I advise getting there early because as soon as 5 o'clock hit the place started to fill up! The drinks are awesome! Their specialty drinks were only $5 and they are great quality. Everyone loved the mule kick which had a great taste of ginger along with mango. I also liked the apricot drink that had a great mint accent taste. Beyond the wonderful drinks, the food was to die for. For the table we ordered the cheese fries (so addicting and the cheese was spread throughout, no stingyness), onion rings ( THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD-- HANDS DOWN), the flatbread (very flavorful and you can taste the quality of the toppings), apart from that I shared the BLT Camelback Burger with my bf (cooked to perfection with the best bun I have ever had on a burger).

The inside is clean and vibrant and practically begs you to buy a milkshake.  This is a great place to take your kids and let them be themselves.  The upbeat atmosphere encourages kids to enjoy themselves and caters to them by providing old-school paper hats, a menu to color on, and a piece of cardboard that folds into a car.  However, the gumball and claw machines in the entryway may be hard to hustle your kids past.

The food here is typical of burger diners.  The burgers and melt sandwiches are greasy and good.  The fries are thin and crispy and salted well.  The milkshakes?  Very nice!  The hustle and bustle of the place can make for a hit or miss experience regarding the expedience of your visit, but it's usually pretty quick.

The prices are also quite fair.  I took my two children and we all had a meal and shared a milkshake for a $20 bill.  Not bad considering the tip was over 30%.

The menu is quite large, even for the lunch menu, which is definitely a plus. Personally I feel that the lunch price is more worth it ($15 weekdays, $16 weekends), compared to the $10 premium for dinners. They have special promotions right now so if you pay cash you get 10% discount.

The food I liked today includes the short ribs, sakura rose sushi, skillets, chicken kagame, calamari, takoyaki, beef and mushroom wrap. They have many options for ice creams, like 5 of them! One thing to stay clear of is their cakes selection...don't order them! They are store bought so the taste is pretty generic and awful. But the pudding is quite soft and smooth though, if you can get over the synthetic mango taste...

Also, one thing to consider is that many fried items/skillets/kitchen items only comes in 1 piece when you put 1 on the order, as opposed to 1 serving. So typically their portion is quite small so you can try more things.

But my first piece of fish nearly gave me a seizure. What may have been a nice piece of tuna was just a fire-punch to the nose, from the inside out. So I redid my soy mix, but there was really no saving the whole plate. The fish quality also seemed to be down, from what I could tell.

This location feels much larger than the Henderson and Decatur locations I'm used to.  I was just in time for the first shipment of the seasonal dried mandarin orange slices.  But my usual purchase, the mini cocoa batons, was out.  So were the butter waffle cookies and butter almond thins, the most popular items that Hawaii visitors buy to take back.

The staff are as friendly as I've come to expect from a Trader Joe's.  I was asked twice if I could use assistance as I went through the store.  Those who answered my questions did so happily.  Checking out was quick and efficient.",2015-01-20 19:10:49

This place is always super crowded and it's kind of hard to find parking. I love the interior designs. With all the dimsum I found it a bit over priced and usually I don't mind about the price but for the quality of the food I would've expected it to be better. But one of their dimsum dishes were actually quite scrumptious! I think it's called the number one bun in the world? It's a pineapple crust with bbq pork stuffed inside of the bun! Other than that there's nothing special about this place.,2016-06-01 22:19:48

However, yesterday I had an experience to give them that extra star. I always get one of the eggs Benedict or something in the sandwich section or a regular breakfast with pancakes. 

But wait so back to yesterday, we had multiple servers come up and wait on us and try to fill our water or get us stuff. On top of that, my friend doesn't eat pork so he asked for all turkey sausage with his meal. Unfortunately it came out with bacon piled on it. However, the waitress immediately took it back once we said it wouldn't have been a big deal but he doesn't eat pork and they started making a whole new plate of everything. 

I decided to branch out and get the chicken and waffle. I'm picky about chicken and waffles no matter where I go because I've had some great ones and some ok ones. But let me tell you, this no frills chicken and waffle was amazing. It's nothing fancy, which is what I expected. But the chicken was soooo juicy and breaded and fried perfectly and the waffle had just enough sweetness to it to balance it out and was dense but fluffy at the same time. And the best part is it comes with a side of eggs. Usually when I get chicken and waffles I want eggs and get them as a side but this one it comes with it and I got them over easy and it was great. 

Honestly I can't wait to go get it again.",2018-02-12 21:37:55

Went to see the Improv group this weekend in their new location - the back room of Wet Willies. The new venue is a wayyyy better. Cover is still $10 per person (you can make reservations, but you can also just show up). 

Now they have waiter service - you can order any drinks or food from Wet Willies and they bring it right to you. I'm not saying the food is stellar, but at least there's the option if laughing gives you the munchies. The seating is also better, lots of comfy leather couches and small tables.

Joia has a daily menu in addition to the regular menu which can be viewed online. We were served bread with oil/vinegar after we ordered.

For our appetizer, we ordered escargots with portobello, onion and garlic in a merlot sauce on crostini. It was SO delicious, definitely my favourite part of the dinner.

Our mains were veal marsala and risotto, both were amazing. The veal marsala was quite a thin sliced portion but very filling as it was served with truffle mash and grilled veggies. The risotto was also great, mixed with green peas, red onion and mascarpone cream..I just wish for $23, the risotto would be served with some kind of protein.

I'm always on the lookout for kid friendly activities around town so I'm glad this one is close-by and very air conditioned. Living in las vegas, this is a must. Seems like it would be a great place for company gatherings and small birthday parties. Two rooms for parties are available, with limited space. In my opinion, 15 ppl should be the max if you want to have room to move around. 

Before you enter the room, there's a quick run down on safety and rules. Once that's done, you enter the holding dock to gear up. The game lasts about 25 minutes. With sensors on your chest, back and shoulders, it's pretty easy to get hit. My suggestion, stay on the second floor and take aim at everyone on the bottom floor and watch out for mirrors. The screen on your laser allows you to see who you've hit and vice versa. Once you're done, they keep track of your scores and stats. You get to see where you rank with the rest of the group. And they provide a printout to keep as a souvenir. 

Although, I wouldn't recommend this activity for small children (7 years & under) it's definitely an awesome place for the older kids (8 & up) and adults. It is very dark with neon lights and fog. It's very easy for the little ones to get knocked down especially when there's a lot of teenagers running at top-speed. Better yet, have them play air-hockey in the meantime, there's two tables and a few arcade games, not many though. Best to come with a group and test your skills.",2017-08-29 18:38:38

I imagine that individual diners may have a different experience, but alas, this was mine. I do enjoy Spanish food (a lot...) and plan to return to try them out again in the near future.

We had a smattering of pre-ordered tapas to start - these ranged from stuffed peppers and calamari (really tasty), to the traditional ""tortilla"" egg and onion dish. I must say that these were delicious and well prepared - these dishes definitely whet my appetite for things to come...

For my main dish, I figured that a paella would be a ""signature dish"" for a Spanish restaurant, and decided to indulge. Unfortunately, I was VERY disappointed in this dish overall, as it was mostly a gargantuan pile of yellow rice with small amounts of chicken, fish, and seafood. I've had paellas many, many times, and have come to expect a certain level of excellence with this dish, although it is very challenging to prepare. Perhaps it was the large number of diners we had with our group, but this dish was hastily thrown together, and basically tasted as if it had come directly from a Vigo box.

The atmosphere is nice - we sat in their banquet room, and it was an attractive, comfortable place to conduct our meeting and eat. Service was EXCELLENT - the wait staff kept all the drinks topped off, and were extremely attentive. I especially liked the sangria, it was delicious, and plentiful!

So, while I've given it a paltry two stars for this single experience, I believe that mitigating factors could be in play here, and will give them a second chance sometime soon. We plan to focus mainly on a tapas style dinner, rather than having the entrees - the enormous portions of all the entrees I saw really was a bit of a turn-off... The excellent, friendly service, I suspect, is more representative of what they are trying to accomplish here.",2013-04-12 02:49:00

DJ Shaddix is so nice and will play all the line dances that you want. Trent is an awesome bartender and I just need to look at him to get my usual drink!

Line dancing tips:
Wear Boots or something that will slide on the floor. I see so many people try in flip flops or heels and they look like they are going to break an ankle. Ouch!
2-step is really fun if you have a good leader. On locals night there are a lot of good dancers. So just ask and you can generally get a Yes. 
Some more advanced dancers will add a bit of flare, but the general steps are more basic. Try to follow along or ask someone in between songs to show you off the dance floor or off to the side. Most people are very nice about that. 
Gilley's does offer lessons at 7 or 8pm most days I can't remember which.

On Mondays a few tips. $1 drinks for locals till 10pm. A lot of locals will be there and they are REALLY good dancers. The locals get annoyed with some of the drunk tourists, but at the same time the drunks will get mad at the locals. They claim they need to practice in order to know what they are doing. The locals dance a few nights a week and definitely get their practice in. I agree that the locals on Monday's should be a bit more inclusive of people just trying to learn. I know that I help when I can. I suggest that you try and control your liquor and practice respectfully and don't bump into people. ha ha. Drunk dancing starts about 11pm if that is what you are really into. Or there is a Senor frogs down the way that offers that all night. 

On Fridays a few tips. Bull ride watching on Friday's are my favorite because there tends to be a bachelor or a bachelorette party and they put the person who is the most intoxicated up there. It is $10 to ride the bull. I will not be getting up there. Toughest Man-Bull riding competitions that they do every so often are fun to watch. They also do bikini bull riding on Sunday's if they get enough girls.

The food is also really good. My favorite is the pulled pork sliders. 

A few things that would make it that much more spectacular:
Better drink specials on Friday's. For a local, it can get pricey on Friday's.

First of all, the food. The spinach salad was blah. I expected more than just a handful of spinach with a few onions and tomatoes. For 9.95? And the spinach pastry? The pastry was outstanding, but it wasn't ""stuffed with fresh spinach""; rather it had a thin layer of blackened, strong-tasting spinach spread on one side of the inside of the puffy pastry. Horrible! Couldn't eat it! And the server didn't even notice.

Secondly, the service. When my friend and I arrived, there were only four other customers, yet we had to wait nearly ten minutes to order our drinks and food. After we ate and our plates were taken away, it took 20 MINUTES for our server to return with our check. Actually, our server did not return on her own; my friend got up and tracked her down.

We stopped in on a weekday for lunch so that means that you can have dim sum if you want, but you have to order off a menu instead of picking off a steam cart.  The steam cart and the delicious desserts are for the weekends only.  Darn.

However, even though we had to order off the menu, everything ... and I mean EVERYTHING ... we ordered was delicious.  Not one clunker amongst the bunch.

So, here's what we ordered:

Siu Mai (pork and shrimp dumplings, steamed)
Stuffed bean curd (fried tofu with shrimp)
Pork bun (steamed) 
Sharkfin dumpling - perfect
Fried dumpling - also perfect
Spring roll (chicken) - yep, perfect
Sesame ball - my kids loved this

Well, on a recent trip to Montreal with my two kids, I decided to take them to all my old haunts. I was saddened to see that so many were either gone or just....sad and run down. So I was THRILLED to return to San Tropol to discover it was just the same, wonderful, eclectic place as it was back in my McGill days (1980-1983)!!!! The whole restaurant was the same, the set-up was the same, and the fabulous food was the same!

We sat outside in the lovely courtyard terrasse, and it was as pretty as always - perhaps prettier, even, with a cobalt blue fence with happy yellow details, a small central garden with small statues, and strung lights from the trees. Intimate and pretty. The restaurant interior is as warm as it was 30 years ago, with various sections and two central washrooms (the latter are small, unisex, and be forewarned: the door on one washroom never closes or locks. Yikes). Embossed metaled coffered tiles line the ceiling and walls, with large, opened garage door ""windows"" and overhead fans in the summertime, creating a breezy space. 

The menu is still great, with humongous cream cheese-based sandwiches made from fresh bread. I was saddened to see that my ""Sisters of Jeanne Mance"" sandwich was no longer offered (it was my old standby), but thankfully they still had the ""Northern Lights"" (with olives. A family favorite!), and they had some new offerings which were delicious: the ""No. 6.5"" with bananas and black currents and honey was amazingly delicious! And my youngest kid had the ""Mango Madness"" which she loved (she said it was a bit spicy, though - and very messy! But she ate the whole thing). The cauliflower and cheddar soup was a bit bitter, and my kids said it had a bit of an off aftertaste, but they doctored it up with a bit of sugar and then said it was great. The accompanying side salads were small but good, and the salad dressing was excellent.

For dessert we shared the carrot cake, and it was a moist as I remember. It could have used a bit more icing, but it was delicious. And the chai latte and the cafes au lait were wonderful, and presented beautifully in pretty glasses with fruit as garnishes. In fact, all the dishes were plated and presented beautifully, with lovely fruit garnishes.

Our server was nice, despite her manning many tables, we didn't have to wait long at all.

Pros:
-Clean & attentive service, unlike a lot of other places. Fills my tea promptly. Checks on us often. Doesn't forget our items
-Decent menu selection. Dessert is more than other places. They have mousse cake and some jelly.
-Teppanyaki shrimp here is the next level. Shrimps were HUGE.
-Beef skewers were the highlight of the meal
-Tataki version of white tuna and salmon sashimi. 
-The rolls were excellent. I had arctic, double dragon, and monkey roll. Not too much rice.
-They provide soft drinks.
-Tempura chicken and fish katsu are things I haven't seen before in AYCE sushi. The chicken was a very tender piece of chicken breast. 

Disappointments:
-While I like red tuna sushi, they cut it way to thin. If you're going to cheap out on it and give me lots of rice, I'd prefer you just took it off the menu. Other sushi weren't as bad but the fish-rice ratio isn't up to my standard.
-Sano Shrimp was awful, especially for a dish that has the restaurant's name.
-Mackerel sashimi was heavily salted. 
-The teppanyaki squid didn't feel like teppanyaki. It felt like stir fried squid.

It was just me, the waiter, and the chef.  The very unconventional looking waiter was super friendly, made me very comfortable.  He always indicated what his favorite was, either wine or teas.  I appreciate the input when at a new place.  The prices were reasonable, it was happy hour so they  had drink specials.  The dinner was linguini with grilled calamari steak, artichokes, capers, olives, tomatoes...yummy, I cant stop saying yummy.   After a while, more women started coming in, all of them in search of desserts.  The waiters description of their desserts was like food porn.  I knew Id take something home.  
The chef took the time to come and ask about the food, and he also was very friendly and personable.  
All and all, between the food, and the service, I had an excellent date with myself :)  Oh, and I had some tea too, of course.  Im a big tea drinker and it was really good, walnuts, coconut, pineapple, very refreshing.  I rolled out of there completely stuffed, and very satisfied.

I had the She Crab Soup, smelled a little fishy at first but was good. Not the best I've ever had. Bread was served which was a little stale.
For my entree, I actually chose two appetizers (as I was not th with the entree options). I had the Beef Tartare and Prosciutto Macaroni & Cheese.

In regard to my beverage, the woman behind the counter had little knowledge about the drink besides that it was strong (had a shot of espresso in it, in addition to lavender simple syrup, orange juice, sparkling water and candied orange peel). As you can tell by the ingredients, I was perplexed as to how this would taste. Surprisingly, it was not too sweet and had a strong coffee taste with a hint of orange. I did not taste lavender, but maybe my taste sense was off today?! Anyway- I do recommend trying this at least once...not sure how long it will be around as it's on the summer drink menu.

The salad did not have the best visual appearance but was quite delicious. I loved the passion fruit vinaigrette and how the different ingredients melded together. Thin strips of mango and jicama, pineapple and crispy prosciutto...made for a delicious salad.

Well, our experience was truly horrible. The server that we had was not the one we were used to. Initially, she was helpful despite the language barrier. When our dishes arrived, it was not what my mother indicated to her. She then became defensive and stated that it wasn't her fault that my mother did not accurately specify what she wanted. 

Mom sent back the soup which she never touched and the server gave her a hard time. The server never came back afterwards to ask us if everything was okay. In fact, it was the crew member who brought my mother the redone soup and gave us the same ""it's not our fault speech"" when we asked her questions. Mom told me that the soup did not taste like what she had the last time that she went. She suspects that it was the same soup with different garnishes.

The salad that I ordered tasted fresh and fine, but was missing ingredients that I am used to seeing such as galangal, lemongrass and thai chilies. Instead, I got a sliver of jalapeno pepper and saw that they use bottled lemon juice in the kitchen. In other words, they are charging the same prices, while shortchanging the customer on authenticity. FYI, they do not make their curries in house; they use a curry mix as per their own admission.

I was going to order dessert, but changed my mind after the latter. When it came time to check out, the server ignored me refused to give me the ticket. As a matter of fact, she looked angry and had a stone face while looking sideways. The crew member was the one who checked us out and tried to diffuse the tension.

(Because of this, it will also be hard to find parking in the evenings, and I suggest going early to find a spot). The Viva and Yrt will also pass conveniently close to the studio.

The service here is pretty shameful. I visited this studio twice, and on my first visit I had been waiting for a friend, (caught in northbound rush hour, of course) I signed up for a class and let them know I was waiting for her. I wasn't even expecting a response, since it was a haphazard comment informing them why I wasn't heading towards the changeroom. What I got was a rude and unnecessary, ""Well we don't let latecomers in"" response from a young man & woman. I am very well aware of that rule, and I was in no way going to be late (and this was at least 20 mins before the class).  

On my second visit, the service was satisfactory but totally forgettable at best. 

The studio and changeroom(s) are clean, well-lit and new, albeit cramped once the evening crowd makes its way in. You'll be left wondering if there are by-laws set in place for yoga studios and crowd control, and the studio is representative of that. It was very, very cramped for a regular-priced Moksha class.

In my experience the service here was adequate but not warm or inviting. I debated writing anything about this restaurant because although the food was delicious I recognized that it might be the kind of aloof attitude that would turn people off and impact their experience. However, we enjoyed the food - which started with Babaganoush and Fattouch salad. There was a pleasant smokiness to the eggplant which was scooped up with crisp, toasted pita breads. It was both creamy and had chunks of eggplant, which are my favorite part. The salad was zesty and refreshing, and was a good foil to the fried Sea Bream that arrived later on. We also had the grilled octopus appetizer which was slightly charred and yet still mostly tender, with a lemon and olive oil drizzle. We managed to totally destroy the whole fish we picked out earlier and were filled to the brim by the end of the meal. Some rice came with the fish, but upon reflection we should have ordered grilled vegetables to lighten the meal. I would order every item again, and there were plenty of other tantalizing items on other tables.

Friendly service, takes a bit of time to get your order, at time of our visit only 1 person behind the counter.

This our first visit here, Mamajoun was listed in Scarborough Mirror as recommended places to eat.

Food : I would likely say most of the ""jouns"" are good for a snack for 1 person, 2 is likely more than plenty for 1 person to eat unless you're super hungry.  My wife and I were only looking for a snack so we had 1 joun each (1 ham & cheesy joun and 1 half zataar and have cheese).  If you are really hungry I would say consider their Pizza offerings.  Can't comment on the pizza's as of this writing since we haven't ordered a pizza here yet.  Will update of course when we do.

Drinks : If you are a diabetic beware of the Jarritos drinks.  Even tho the ones we got (mandarin and mango) tasted good, the sugar content is really high.

Note for foodie's with Gout : ""soujouk"" is a beef sausage made in house.  If you are managing your Gout flare-ups I'd recommend avoiding the items with ""soujouk"".

The food was absolutely delicious and flavourful, however, I can agree with the previous person who reviewed this restaurant about some of the portions being a bit small.  

So if you have an appetite for good Italian food but you want a larger portion, you will need to order more food options or come with a less hearty appetite to begin with.

And in addition, I would recommend this place as a date location to grab a glass of wine or a light dinner with your special person. My boyfriend and I enjoyed a wonderful night last summer on Vivoli's patio, taking back some white wine and enjoying the candlelight.

5. Eel yakitori. We ordered few other yakitori items like pork belly, duck etc... Most of them are alright but the eel was excellent, the charcoal grill works great for the eel, it gave a nice smokey flavor to the fish.

If you make it to this place you are in for a surprise, the menu is great with variety of choices to indulge on. Everything is made then and is fresh!

Service was exceptional as we walked in with around 10 people and there were plenty of seats. The owner/ cashier at the till was very friendly and patient with us till we figure our what to get as everything on the menu looks good. 

Food-wise people went with burgers, Honey Garlic Chicken, Spicy Chicken, Quesadilla and Pasta w. Roseo Sauce and all the people enjoyed the food as it was fresh and hot. 
I went with Mushkaki Beef Burger which is topped with lettuce, tomato, fried egg, cheese, mushkaki sauce, ketchup, and mayo. I also added one more beef patty on to the burger...and WOW the burger was too good! hot, cooked well and yet juicy and the egg went so well with it. I also choose their spicy fries and they were very good, crispy and with a different taste. 

The portions are really good also expect a bit of a wait as the food comes out fresh. They have a TV in the restaurant for sports fan.

I will definitely come back as there is so much to try especially Mushkaki Fries. Which the owner stated is a meal to itself as it comes with chicken in the fries.

We were seated immediately and the server got us our drinks and some warm bread and butter right away.  Our server was very friendly (in fact just a little too sugary sweet) and she did her job well.

We ordered from the lunch menu.  I got the Miso Salmon and my husband ordered the cheese pizza.  Our food was out within 15 minutes and mine was delicious, but my husband said his pizza was just so-so and about the same quality as a cheese pizza from Sam's Club.  (OUCH!)

Anyway, our bill for two passion fruit iced teas, a lunch pizza, a lunch salmon and a slice of the pina colada cheesecake (to go) was $42, before gratuity.  The baby just ate off of my plate because she is too little for her own plate still.

I ate the pina colada cheesecake slice later that night and it was just okay.  It may just be me, but I think that their more exotic cheesecake flavors aren't nearly as good as the plain old vanilla bean cheesecake.  Maybe it's because the other ingredients in the more exotic cheesecake varieties detract from their perfect vanilla cheesecake recipe...?  I dunno what it is, but I've experienced this phenomenon more than once.  Sadly this time I thought it'd be different with the promising pina colada flavor, but it just didn't deliver.  It didn't taste very tropical, or very cheese-cakey.

I live near this restaurant and heard good things since they opened/took over the old Chinese restaurant. First time trying, I just ordered a couple staple classic dishes; beef lo-mein & mooshu pork. The lo mein was so bland, had absolutely no flavor. The beef was chewy and had a really weird texture & flavor. Ended up picking out the rest and throwing it away. The Moo Shu was better but very bland also. Had to actually use the soy sauce packets to add flavor. Decent portions. If I were to base my rating on this meal, I would've given 1 star.
There were alot of Chinese people eating there, and my friend that highly recommended them was Chinese as well. So I figured I would give them another chance, and this time order from the ""authentic Chinese"" menu I've been hearing about.
This time I ordered; Steamed Flounder with ginger & scallions, Mapo tofu with pork, and Snow Pea tips. 
1. The flounder was tiny and thin. Flavor was good, but it was $23! It was maybe worth $12 tops. Full of bones too.
2. The Mapo Tofu was really good, but you could barely tell there was any pork in it. Would order it again, but without pork to pay for this time. Great size portion.
3. The Snow Pea tips were awesome. No complaints, good size.
These 3 dishes cost me $50. Grrrrrrr...

It arrived by a friendly man, he want hot.. DARN! but hey, a birthday girl cant get everything on her wish list. 

The delivery consisted of 5 big balloons, 3 pink and two lime green. Pssh, i knew my grandma would pick these colors. Shes lime color obsessed. Sorry gram ;) The cake was decorated in the same slew of colors. Adorable! The bundt had a party hat on top that was pink and had a lime green butterfly. Also one this wonderful decorated cake was a cute pink flower two candles representing my age. How old is that? Yeah, like im going to tell you. Dream on!

Once eating it, I was overcome by flavors. It was chocolate chocolate chip and the frosting was cream cheese. Literally after two bites I was done. Thats a good thing, since i watching my weight. Plus then theres more to share. Opps did i just say that. Share? gosh i never do that!! Even my nieces couldnt believe how sweet it was.

Fram Grill serves fantastic meals in a cozy space suited for both indoor or outdoor seating. Regardless of party size, the Farm Grill can accommodate you! There awesome picnic tables scattered outside, many of them situated under large shade trees to keep you out of that AZ sun. If air conditioning is your thing, then there are plenty of indoor seats that provide a much cooler climate during the summer daze.

If you've dined at one of Joe's other restaurants you know the food will be good. All ingredients are sourced locally, and many of the veggies are farmed right behind the shop in Agrotopia farms. You can walk over after your meal to watch them harvest the greens, spices, veggies, etc. And let me tell you, when you are biting into that freshly grilled hamburger you can taste how fresh those onions and leaf lettuce is! It's awesome. The salads are massive in size and super fresh. There's a couple of BBQ items that are delicious too. 

Drink options are fun. The organic brand Tractor Soda is served here and they offer fun and unique carbonated flavors such as Cola, Root Beer, Ginger Beer, Cherry Cream, Coconut, Blood Orange, Lemon Grass, Meyer Lemon and Cucumber. They are awesome!! (You can also grab a traditional canned soda if you're not feeling adventurous). 

Breakfast is served here as well, and there's a great kids menu for both breakfast and lunch. Joe has really built up this corner of Gilbert- there's an awesome coffee shop steps away from the Farm Grill if you'd like a nice espresso after your meal. Grab an award winning cupcake there if there's any room left in your stomach! Walk a few more paces and visit the new hangar co-op space. You'll find cool wares and food there too!

I went with medium which was definitely a good kick and not too hot. They're really nice about adding extra garlic sauce on top. I once tried my friend's and they had the seasoning put on it. It was a potent taste that I didn't care for. It was almost like Cayenne pepper. Just tell them you don't want it. The only thing that kills it for me is the rice is so bland so it ruins the flavor of the chicken and sauces. Otherwise it's a pretty decent place for my fix.

The skewer of mushrooms was not like a shish-kabob of mushrooms rather a whole little pan of them! And the moxy-size Amaretto sour was a well made (giant) drink.

1. Seafood pancake 9.95
2. Bulgogi 8.95
3. Hot stone bibimbap 9.95

- For previous SoCal residents, this restaurant can be summed up as every Korean restaurant inside H-Mart. One prime example would be Dae Jang Gum H-Mart in Garden Grove. 
- Quick service. Fast food. A few dollars more that Dae Jan Gum but not in a food court. 
- The food that we ate was pretty average, just like food court quality in SoCal, but for Las Vegas, I think this is great especially for their location. 
- The seafood pancake needed to be a bit more crispy and ratio of seafood to green onion was way more to the side of green onion.
- The bulgogi did not come on a hot stone plate. It tasted similar to H-Mart bulgogi. 
- I was a bit surprised that they served it with salad and not sliced cabbage with dressing. The salad was better. 
- The rice needed to be burnt a bit more in the hot stone bowl. 
- Only 4 types of banchan was served to us. Kim Chi needs to be fermented a bit more. 
- Although sounding picky, it is what is expected in this quality kind of restaurant. OC residents probably also agree. I'd definitely come back bc of convenience and value, and it reminds me of H-Mart. but don't come out of your way here if you're from CA.",2014-04-01 21:03:43

My wife and I moved to California in 2004 and moved back to the Youngstown area in 2009.  We visited TCC at the end of 2010 for the first time in almost 6 years.  Where had all the good stores gone?  Where was the up-scale?  There was a freakin' DOLLAR STORE in there.

I don't know what happened while we were gone, but there was a moment in TCC where I was almost in fear for our safety.

This little french restaurant is cozy, warm and charming with an inviting sign outside enticing you to come in out of the cold. 

The restaurant is aptly named with a small concise menu that offers just 7 appetizers and 7 simple main courses. One of each meat really: steak, chicken, lamb, duck, scallops, trout, a vegetarian option.

Each is artistically presented, full of fresh perfectly cooked food and covered in an always delicious sauce. All the main courses cost exactly $25 and the appetizers $11. 

My advice, order the lamb! 

Typically, I am not a lamb fan but this stuff was melt in your mouth delicious. Everyone at the table agreed it was the best of the meals we ordered (duck, scallops and lamb). 

The desserts are equally simple and delicious. Get the sticky toffee pudding. It's sinfully good.

Firstly, it is ironic that some of the best French-style pastry comes to Canada courtesy of a Japanese couple! Many of the customers are Japanese. I am surprised there are not more other Asian-Canadian customers as they always like to zoom in on Japanese businesses. Secondly, the bakery is still cute and adorable. The design touches and the horizontal door serving as legs for their counter are cute. The décor is quite comparable to Maman, except Mon K came first.

The pastry is still good and they have not changed their recipes. The pear tart, raspberry tart, lemon tart and mousse are the best. The downside is that they are quite small.
Less successful are their croissants and Danishes. The upside is that they are quite big!
Overall, their items are flavourful and visually appealing.

Their coffee and beverages are just average and nothing special.

I am thinking of not returning to Mon K because the shop is getting a little dusty and is not so clean anymore. There is some debris from the street on the floor and under the tables one finds crumbs and old cookie pieces. The four tables are often not immediately cleaned.

They do not accept credit card.
The worst part is the owner who is quite moody. Sometimes she is OK and the last couple of time I went there she was grumpy and frowning. However, if manners and 'thank-yous' are unimportant to you then you would not care. 
She should really leave it to the back office if she is having difficulties or experiencing domestic or professional problems.

The sandwich was good, but the menu said it was on sourdough - and it might of been - but tasted like a hamburger bun. I've never had sourdough with sesame seeds. The horseradish sauce on it was ok, but not very hot. I think most people see ""horseradish"" and expect a little zing! Chips were great and not too salty which I love.

Having admitted my fondness for baked goods and a perhaps odd fascination with vegan pastry it was only a matter of time before I visited nami - in part due to the aforementioned interests and good word of mouth from a vegetarian friend and in part due to its location just down the street - but little did I know just how good it would turn out to be...or how many times I'd visit (Three to be exact, the most recent being a breakfast with friends on 12/30/12.)

Owned by Damon Brasch and operated on a daily basis by what seems to be a collection of cute college girls that you might see at Whole Foods or a local Co-Op, most of the things that nami does it does very well, perhaps most surprisingly their vegan take on the Blizzard entitled 'tsoynami,' the rich soy-based ice cream lacking any hint of ""soy"" and fixed with any number of mix-ins, some menu staples and other seasonal.  Available 7:00am to 9:30pm I've had them at both ends of the spectrum and honestly prefer them to any frozen ""shake"" I've had save for, perhaps, the concretes at Shake Shack - the pumpkin was particularly excellent as part of breakfast.

Moving to the baked goods, as much as I wanted to like the donuts I just could not, save for the baked zucchini version and the dense blueberry fritters.  Perhaps it was the glaze or perhaps the actual batter but something about each of them harkened that 'beany' flavor that turns so many off to soy based vegan foods.  More impressive, perhaps due to the intense sweetness or a different glaze, the cinnamon roll was a much better choice, as was the turnover with a light flakey shell, sweet whipped soy, and fresh blueberry puree.

Moving on to the rest - I think it is safe to say that anything nami makes with chocolate is a safe bet - the rich organic tablets behind the bar likely 70% cocoa or better and a dominant flavor whether in a tsoynami, drizzled on a pancake, baked into a moist cupcake, or best of all made into dense ""snickers"" fudge that trumps the original by miles.

Last, and certainly not least, for those who don't want chocolate - and all the more so for those unfortunate enough to be gluten intolerant (the real sort, not the trendy Hollywood stuff,) get the Yankee Doodle - a nearly quarter pound snicker doodle sandwich with dense, creamy filling, that is better than any snickerdoodle I've had elsewhere - vegan, veg, gluten free, or otherwise.",2013-05-29 12:57:04

I ordered the Croque Madame mainly because of everyone going on and on about the French Fries they serve with it. I mean... everyone talks about them like they are some kind of narcotic and you need your fix to through the day. I waited eagerly for the plate to come to the table, grabbed a few fries, and... they were very good, but definitely not as good as everyone is saying. Maybe I hyped it too much, but I was expecting more.

Seriously though... To be honest, F the French Fries. The real star is the Croque Madame. That has to be THE best breakfast I have ever eaten. Toasted ham and cheese were very good, the brioche was even better, but I think the combination of everything with the slightly runny sunny side up egg and mornay sauce puts this way over the top.

I normally don't like to go to a particular restaurant twice in a single visit while in Vegas, but I think for this place I might make an exception (dinner one night and breakfast in the morning before leaving for home). The atmosphere is definitely casual (breakfast), there were both couples and families, and it doesn't have the snooty vibe to it.

I ordered two garlic shrimp appetizers, two soups of the day, and garlic chicken with rice. The service was pleasant and the bartender assisted with my order. The food was prepared in ~20 minutes and smell from the packaging was alluring.

The packing however was inappropriate and led to the sauce spilling throughout the box. Additionally, instead of using clear covers over the foil containers, white covers were used so it was impossible to quickly check to see if all food ordered had been packed and given to me. That's a rookie mistake an experienced restaurant shouldn't be making--it led to my rice being left out. I literally received chicken bathing in a ton of sauce and zero rice. 

The soups had a very odd flavor. They consisted of kale, olive oil (Lord knows why) and a green broth. If the oil hadn't been there it would have been pleasant. The chicken was good but far too thin. The shrimp were okay but overcooked. And they packed two orders of shrimp into one container. Why? How did they know two different people wouldn't be eating the shrimp appetizers? 

I would return to try dining at Mallorca. But I wouldn't do takeout again. They don't pack appropriately and seem to take liberties with take-out customers that they would not take with dine-in customers.",2017-02-10 13:40:46

I think of it as the world's classiest frat house - it has a laid-back, casual feel with sofas instead of restaurant tables and two floors to amble around and chat with others, and it also has expensive, delicious cocktails that would make any mixologist proud. Ed, who works on the upper floor, is also a super cool dude who loves talking with his customers. Finally, they have tiny boxes of spicy noodles that are just perfect to fill your tummy after you've had a few drinks here. I will confess that it doesn't emphasize beer or wine.

Update: 7/3/16- late night 
I don't know what's with this place but it lost a star for inconsistency last night. I'm not going to write a whole other review, but I'll simply list below the reasons I've decided to drop a star

- didn't get silverware upon sitting down 
-table was dirty when we arrived 
-gave me a small ""sample size"" cup of ranch for my salad when that's not what I'm typically served with 
-I had 3 pieces of bread on my buff chicken salad and when I asked if there was a 4th missing, waitress said, ""it must have fallen off and I forgot to put it back on. If you want another one, I can make it for you?"" 
-husband had a 5 French fries for his side 
-asked for onions added to my salad, didn't happen
- asked for extra napkins and waitress also asked us if we wanted plates for the apps. We said yes... Neither happened.
-waitress did not apologize for any of these issues
-had to ask another waitress to bring the check because ours avoided us after all these incidents. 

Not to mention, there was a manager on duty who chose to not check in.

Masquerading as a 1950's zombie comedy (zom com?) it is actually a classic burlesque show with a modern point of view. The great burlesque clowns, dancers, and variety artists of the '40's  would recognize this as one of their own. The show is equal parts comedy, music, dance, and striptease. 

It is one of the funniest shows I've seen in ages. The music was great. The live band alternately rocked and swung, and the vocalists were out of this world - and thankfully all live.

The striptease was classy and fun. The girls were beautiful and seemed to be honestly enjoying themselves. This is not bar room pole dancing; these are truly first-class entertainers. Each number had a different theme with fun costuming and sets. (This pic is from a sort of ""Gay Carmen Miranda meets Harry Belafonte"" number) The boys were equally hot, though their roles were definitely more comedic than sexy. 

Great fun for anyone looking for a bit of adult entertainment in Las Vegas! Should be a number one choice for bachelor/Ette parties!

To start off the host is incredibly full of himself, overly brisk, with the feeling that you should understand you are lucky to be in his restaurant. The tasting menu is definitely a tasting menu, a small taste of a few things. The rooms are lovely, the design excellent, the service staff very efficient. A very large investment has been made in far out dishware, too bad the same can't be said for the food. The serving plates were piping hot, sadly not hot enough to heat up the food. The cheese course was a joke, reminiscent of those cardboard circular cheese boxes with a dozen triangles of tasteless cheese, along with two tiny smears of soemthing that may have tasted good if there was enough to taste. The lobster bisque tasted oddly sour for some reason. The main: Tyle Fish could have come from Captain Highliner, the sauce was so incredibly spicy there was no tasting of the fish. Lukewarm mashed potatoes (they cool of quickly when there is only a teaspoon of them, could have come from a box of powder. The dessert sampler was merely amusing. The biggest item on the menu was pretension, definitely more than I needed.

To finish off the evening we were presented with a menu card that ordered us to pay a $25.00 tip! Nothing less, nothing more. 

When a restaurant starts off by acknowledging that they have rough rubes as customers and need to be instructed on tipping, they lost me.

Groupons and Winterlicious should be mediums to bring in new customers to become regular customers, not to drive them away after one evening.

I always order the Momo Yellowtail Sashimi special. At $12-14 it's not that great of a deal but they serve it with more fish than other places; the yellowtail is cut perfectly and covered with the right amount of citrus sauce, jalapeno and cilantro. Sen of Japan adds a crispy topping to this dish that I like, but they charge a little more too.

There are 2 entrances, one on Ontario St. that has some sort of M&B signage, another on king inside the office building. I recommend coming in through Ontario St. and come up the stairs where you will be welcomed with the delicious aroma of pizza and a surprising decor. 

Don't be fooled by the blue glass and white concrete exterior of the building, there interior is rustic but chic. Exposed duct work, wood ceilings, white brick walls, worn wood banquettes, black leather cover chairs, and what I like to call ""THE TABLE"". 

""THE TABLE"" is probably the coolest table in the entire place. Great for holding a large party and possibly used for communal dining. This table has inlay tiles, fancy brown suede seats, and seats up to 15 people.

Service was great as far as large tables go. I came in a very large group of about 12 and the server greeted all of us and was very accommodating. She brought out some free bread and olive oil since it took so long to fire all our pizzas. She had great pizza recommendations and was more than happy to split the bill up so everyone could pay separately. 

The pizza is tremendous. Since coming back from New York a few months ago I've been craving some good pizza and all the pizzas I've had in between just wasn't up to snuff. Mangia e Bevi was a refreshing burst of life in my pizza-world. It's not a New York style pie, it's a thin crust pizza and a good one at that. I got the Prosciutto Funghi pizza. The crust is thin, crisp, and slightly charred, sauce is fresh and not too seasoned, and the cheese is fresh and they don't put too much. The one gripe I have about the pizza is that the crust needs a bit more of a chewiness as I found it to be slightly dense. That being said still the best pizza in our fine city.

Overall, probably my favorite thin crust pizza in the city. At an average price of $12 it is definitely worth a try. Don't be discouraged by the awkward building and location like I was the first time I passed by as I'm still kicking myself for not trying it sooner.",2009-10-16 06:11:19

I noticed the ""green monster"" burger and googled to find out it was a second location of TKs in Scottsdale Quarter, who's food I have found to be bland at best the many times I have visited. The hostess was spacy and very ""scottsdale""- no smile, no emotions, just looked at us dead faced and sat us on the patio and stomped off. Our server, however, was amazing. We got two White Rascals and ordered dinner. My bf had a burger, and I ordered a steak- MEDIUM RARE. Well when we got our food the steak came out well done. Thankfully the waitress insisted that they make me another and let me nibble on the one in front of me. The thing I noticed was how bland it was, just beyond bland. The green beans were great, and our server was awesome, but then the second steak came and it too was almost well done. I am a huge steak lover but it was super disappointing.",2015-04-29 04:49:04

I really like the ambience in this place and perhaps the people that were there on the night of my visit. I noticed this dude sitting at the bar writing an erotic novel on his laptop so I said hi and we exchanged a few lines. Totally cool and reminded me of the bar scene in places like Philly and DC where I'm from. 

I got a chance to try the ""the moon was shining"" drink. It came in this little cute glass jar with a mini cookie on top. So cool! I wish it wasn't as strong so I could finish it. Bummer. If you're a sweet-toothed alcoholic you may want to try this drink.

At around 11 PM the live music started. Some indie singer who sang like he was singing background songs for South Park (the show), and since I'm kind of traditional when it comes to musical taste, I didn't like it. There were plenty of others who seemed to enjoy it though.

So I had been hearing some buzz from friends about Mucha Lucha Tacos, how they have great street tacos and some hot hot sauces (for me the hotter the better baby! ) so I knew it would only be a matter of time before I checked them out!

When I got their I noticed its so of the same set up as chipotle/café rio style of ordering, and after I checked out the menu I went with the 5 street tacos & a bandera wet burrito.

For the tacos, they were red chili chicken, green chili beef and carne asada all topped with cheese, cilantro, pico de gallo and hit with some of their extra hot sauce. OMG SO DANG GOOD! My lips and my mouth were on fire, but I did not care! Each taco had their own great flavor, but I think next time I will skip out on the carne asada and keep with the green chili beef & red chili chicken. It's not that that carne aside isn't good; it's just not as hot as the other meats.  It was the mild ones of the group.

The Bandera wet burrito I got with green chili beef, rice, whole beans & veggies wrapped in a fresh tortilla topped with green and red sauce & jalapeno cream cheese sauce and also topped with some of the extra hot sauce. OMG this was a huge burrito and also lunch for the next day. I think sitting overnight allowed it to get even hotter, LOVE IT SOO MUCH!!!

We ordered 2 kinds of dumpling, steam and pan fried. Both of their dumplings were pretty good, and they were very juicy inside.

We also ordered spicy pig ear, but it turned out to be very tasteless and not spicy at all.

The spicy beef tendon was the best dish so far for the night. It was spicy, and very tasty. It just make my mouth watery even thinking of it again.

We also had some of their noodle soup and pork wonton, and I have to say its pretty good as well.

The bad part about this restaurant were:
1. Maybe they are new or maybe business is pretty good. We had to change 2 of the dishes because they told us they don't have it.
2. Half of our dishes we ordered were kind of tasteless, maybe they wanted to be on the healthy side but I had many China style food before and this restaurant was the tasteless one I found. We ordered around 10 dishes, and 4 of the dishes were pretty bland.
3. The tea that they gave us are ""watery"". You guys know how tea has this tanned color in them but their tea was like clear boiled water with few tea leafs inside. I looked inside the tea pot but there was no tea leafs inside. I assumed the tea came out from a central machine and they didn't change the old tea leafs to a new one and used that batch all day long. Also, the ""watery tea"" was warm and not hot.

After 1 year of living in Champaign, I finally had a chance to come to this restaurant recommended my a previous coworker. The reviews on Yelp are quite mix and it appears that lunch is good, but dinner is so so. Since I have not found another restaurant that has chocolate fondue here in Central IL, we decided to come here for dinner. I will say that I really wanted to like this restaurant, but overall value is a 2 star, the option for fondue brings it up to a 2.5. It is located right on campus and I never even knew about this restaurant when I lived nearby. The ambiance is very eclectic, lots of wall decorations and a European cafe feel. The multiple non-matching chairs throughout the dining room maybe a ""modern"" design, but I felt it was very ""chintzy"". I thought about going with the filet or fish entree, but the other reviews made me a little concern so I went with a safe dish (Shrimp fettuccine) with a light tomato basil cream sauce. It took a bit of time for the dish to come out. Meanwhile, we were given complimentary french bread. Given the name of the restaurant I was a bit disappointed that the bread was not a soft piping hot bread from the oven. Well I digress, back to the entree, it really wasn't anything special. My wife's quote on her salmon salad and the pasta was, ""It taste like food you can make at home"". The portions sizes were also smaller than expected when you order pasta at a restaurant. I was hoping that the chocolate fondue would be the redeeming value of the meal. Unfortunately this was not the case. Typically you would expect strawberries and maybe even a rice crispy treat to dip in the chocolate. Don't get me wrong the dark chocolate was amazing, but they gave a plate of pears, green and red apples, and some sort of cake that crumbled when you poked at it too hard with the fondue fork. Service is hit or miss, our server came by a few times and made sure our cups of water were filled. This maybe a great place for date night on campus or maybe for sandwiches at lunch, but my dinner experience was so so.

Pros: Cheese and chocolate fondue, I have yet to find another place that has this option. Great for date night with wine, cheese, bread etc. 

Cons: Expensive based on what you get, small portion size, no hot fresh bread from the bread company for dinner, where are the strawberries, marshmallow, or rice krispy treats with the chocolate fondue? I think if they tried they could make this a stellar restaurant here in CU.

But were met with huge disappointment, although given the so-so reviews, I guess I wasn't that surprised. First off, the atmosphere is complete different and seriously lacks the charm of Toro Toro. It just feels like an urban restaurant, nothing spanish about it. Moreover, it took about 20 mins for a waitress to come greet us, and tell us she would be back soon to take our drink order. So we waited and chatted away. We didn't understand the wine menu so wanted some help picking out a wine. When the waitress finally bothered to come check up on us, first off she spoke to us in english. I know we are franco-ontarian and have an accent, but how rude. Not only did we keep speaking to her in french she kept answering us in english. Although this was nothing special for Montreal. She didn't really know the wine menu, and informed us that the sommelier would come see us. Now we were very hungry and at this point it had already been 40 mins. We were seated next to the kitchen so it was very loud, and distracting to see all the waiters walk in and out in a continuous stream. Moreover the menu was some type of hybrid tapas menu. The classic spanish ""patatas bravas"" were in fact just fries... and I have never heard of foie gras at a tapas bar in Spain. So we were VERY fed up. One hour in, water as drinks, no orders taken, lack-luster looking food, and bad atmosphere. It didn't take much more for us to leave and make our way to Toro Toro, where we were greeted with a smile, and immediately told about the wine list. So all in all...

If you go in the morning you'll have a great selection but it varies throughout the day. If you go in the evening, many things will be empty. 
Sometimes they put out really bad quality fruits and veg so be careful of what you're buying and check things like berries thoroughly. 
Occasionally they'll refuse to price match certain items if they feel that they're losing too large of a margin (usually things like cherries and watermelons). They do this until they realize people won't pay their full price and then price match it again. I wouldn't mind if they'd put up a sign by the item but you just end up finding out at the cash register.

This review should've been posted a LONG time ago but I have been procrastinating.  As my opening says, their bacon jam is superb!  They should sell it in jars.  I love all their sandwiches and salads.  My favorite is the LGBTQ sandwich.  It is a highly evolved BLT sandwich on a ciabatta bun.  Get the bun toasted and it adds so much depth to the sandwich.  They can also make all their sandwiches into salads.  

They make drinks of the blended kind, fruit waters, coffee, and your regular bottled fair.  My favorite is the Vegan Kale Apple Banana Blended.  Also, the cafe serves lots of pastries!  Their version of the brokie called the Loving vs. Virginia., a marriage of brownie and a cookie.  I can never pass up on this when I'm at The Center.

The restaurant has a cute, vintage bistro atmosphere with eye-catching tilework. The staff is great at seating guests near the windows by the courtyard during breakfast and brunch. And the homemade butter is so fantastic that you might just eat the butter by itself. 

So during our two visits, we ate:
-Croque Madame: it's like taking the most perfect eggs benedict you can imagine, replacing the types of bread, and then making the dish even more delectable and delicious. 
-Brioche french toast: incredible! The toast pieces had no sogginess or heaviness; instead, the toast was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. 
-Omelette with salad: tasty and fluffy omelette with a fantastic mixed greens salad. The vinaigrette was flavorful yet light and was great for breakfast/brunch.
-Pastries: this place knows what it's doing with pastries! We ate a chocolate croissant and pecan sticky bun at the restaurant and also enjoyed a macaron from the Bouchon Bakery stand in the Venetian on the main floor. Don't go anywhere else and order a pastry; get your pastry at Bouchon!

Great hostess and wait staff and they do provide coat checks.

There is also a fair list of options in terms of drinks at very reasonable prices. My go-to drink is their Warehouse Corona which is their take on a Mexican bulldog.

Waitresses were attentive and provide genuine recommendations when asked how one item compared with another.

It's been my consistent experience that the fish is fresh--near perfect--and the craft is solid. It also happens to be a pretty good value for money.

There are a lot of reviews here casting a negative light on Pacific East relative to restaurants in U.S. costal cities (NY, CA, etc.). I've had sushi in Tokyo, Kyoto, NY, SF, Chicago, and many other American cities.  I've had both stellar and less than impressive sushi in all these places.  (Well, not Kyoto--I must admit that everything I've eaten in Kyoto has been near-perfect.)  The fact is that the sushi at Pacific East is good by any standard. As fresh as you get in Tokyo straight that morning from Tsukiji?  Of course not.  But about as close as you can get given the ship-to location.  The people at Pacific East love what they do, and they're good at it.  

Anyone who bashes this place with one or two stars is either (a) an ignorant poseur or (b) a lying poseur.  People love to jump on the 'you can't get good sushi in Cleveland' bandwagon, in a lame attempt at geographical and/or culinary superiority.  To all the reviewers in this category: You have exposed yourselves as fakes.  You apparently taste your food with a map instead of your tongue.

Clean, space looks great, brightly-lit. The grill is tiny for a table of six! We made a reservation for ten people so we can all eat together. That's the whole point of a birthday dinner right? They gave us two separate tables of six. How awkward to shout over another table to tell a joke heh.  

I dislike how every. single. time. I try to show up fashionably late to any friends' gathering, I somehow manage to always be the first one there! Dinner starts at 8?

Anyway. We decide as a part of a group to get the Couples' Special and the Woonam choice. That was split and enough for the five of us that decided to share. 

FOOD: 
All the meats were flavorful and delicious. Kalbi was the star of the show. The grill at a table of six was pretty small though. They didn't turn on the fan for the whole meal until the very end. We didn't realize they even had one until it started! Who else like meat perfume? 

Perfectly seasoned and each piece of meat was like butter after cooked. Smooth and good choice. Marbled meat was pretty. Pork belly was salty enough on its own, but a bit overpowering with slight extra seasoning.

SERVICE: For the whole meal, we had to flag down our server. They checked up on us maybe a couple times during the beginning, but stopped coming for the rest.

We asked for water twice. Didn't come back for 15 minutes until we asked again. Important to note that it was not busy for the time of night. We were the only table on one side of the restaurant with plenty of servers abound. 

We received only one soy bean soup, and they forgot to give us the other one. When we asked for it, the server acted surprised and said that it must have been served at another table. No ""sorry"" whatsoever even in korean. We never got our second soup for the entirety of our meal.

When we went to pay, we all pulled out our cards/cash to split the bill. Note that we did NOT ask for separate checks. The cashier looked irritated, sighed loudly and said in korean to her co-worker: ""Oh my god. What a hassle!"" My friend (birthday girl, mind you) just paid it all in cash to make it easier for them. Wow.  

VERDICT: Great food. Horrible service. I wouldn't come back based on service alone. Not so sure I would want to come back to a place when workers talk about you behind your back in another language when we politely ask for the food/drinks we're paying for.",2014-09-11 12:17:58

A few months back I saw this groupon and purchased it, and it wasn't until a few weeks ago that I had the chance to go. I have been really into vegetarian sushi lately so I was excited to try this place. And Meh... is appropriate for this place. 

I came with my mom and husband on a Thursday night. The place wasn't busy at all and it was around 7pm. I think there were two other parties. When we walked in, the servers all looked at us. It took a few seconds of them staring at us for one to tell us to sit where we want, and then another few moments before anyone brought us menus. I had looked over the menu online before hand so I knew there were a few choices for me. I decided on the avocado rolls, vegan roll, and the tofu tofu roll. As far as the taste of them goes, they were all kind of bland. Even after dipping them in soy and wasabi. There were no sesame seeds on them which helps give them extra flavor. And the wasabi was unusually bland as well. I hardly got any spice from it at all. The most disappointing roll was the tofu tofu roll. It was different, deep fried tofu with green beans rolled inside of the tofu. So there was no rice in this roll. It was just ok. Again, really bland. They could have jazzed up the tofu or something. Everyone knows tofu needs love to taste good. Just tofu cut into blocks and deep fried isn't going to be very tasty.

My mom and husband got the Atkins roll and another one with yellow fin. They were also less than impressed with their selections.  One thing I noticed about this sushi place versus others I have been to, is the portion sizes are way smaller here. I ordered three rolls for me, which at any other sushi places stuffs me to the point where I feel like I am going to explode. Three rolls here, and I was still hungry. It made me sad. The only good thing this place has got going for it is the vegetarian rolls are all really cheap. Which is nice. The price of the fish rolls are all really expensive though. We had a $30 groupon and we still ended up paying an extra $15 on top of that because of how expensive the rolls were. Service here left a lot to be desired as well. The servers all stood around and talked with each other the whole time we were here. And we had to call to them for them to come over to the table. We probably wont be coming back here just because there are so many other sushi places in town better than this one.",2012-03-02 06:49:32

I was overwhelmed & shocked with the amount of food that came with our Tomahawk Chop for 2 .  Part Filet, part Strip, this is an excellent choice for sharing.

Appetizer was the delicious house made bread and I ordered the yogurt with shallots(cousin to onion and garlic). The yogurt is not as thick as I typically like it as i like it to be made with half labneh and half regular yogurt but nothing is going to be perfect for everyone. 

As an entree I got the beef chunks with the chicken breast chunks. They were both so juicy and delicious. The rice was soft and fluffy, with a side of roasted tomato, a side of roasted jalapeno and of course onion. 

In my family some people crush up the tomato into the rice and add the butter with the brown seasoning, personally I am not a big fan of that. The food here is very traditional and delicious. it is fresh and I will be back.

I was able to try the ground chicken skewer and ground beef skewer. The ground chicken was a little drier and not as tasty as the beef but the seasoning was great on both. 

The service was friendly to say the least, very personable and I felt comfortable there. There are many times that Persian restaurants make me feel very out of place but this was not one of them. 

For dessert i did have rose water ice cream which my girlfriend stated tasted like perfume but to me it tasted right. It is a floral tasting ice cream that has pistachios in it. 

I will be back and will make sure my family comes here when they are in town.

We had a reservation for 9pm, but since we had a babysitter for the night, a rarity for us, we decided to go early and sit at the bar. We arrived around 7:30 and were shown to the bar. All three bartenders introduced themselves and were very friendly and attentive. My husband ordered a glass of wine, and I had a peachy pear tini. They are not shy with the liquor. This was the most stout martini, especially flavored martini, that I've ever tasted. But although it was heavy on the liquor, it still tasted great, and was a good pre-meal start. We were so hungry and impatient that we decided to order our appetizer at the bar instead of waiting. We split an order of the stuffed mushrooms. They were cooked perfectly, amazing texture, and the stuffing was amazing. Shortly after we finished up our appetizer my husband informed the bartender that we were ready for the check for this portion of our meal, and they sat us at our table a half hour earlier than our reservation was set, which was great.

Our server was very friendly, very attentive, and very pleasant. The restaurant itself is lovely and feels fancy, especially for folks like us to whom ""eating a good steak"" generally means a trip to Outback. The wine menu was pretty extensive, and my husband had two more glasses of a red wine, while I decided on a Patrón margarita. Once again, the most stout margarita I've ever been served at a restaurant. It was delicious.

We started with salads; my husband had the Caesar, and I had the strawberry almond salad. The portions were large and both salads were delicious. My salad had just enough dressing to taste it lightly but none was visible on the plate. 

For our main meal, my husband had the 22oz Cowboy ribeye rare, while I ordered the filet medium. Both of our steaks were cooked exactly to our preference. We both agreed to being served our steaks on the 500 degree hot plates, which was an excellent decision as they kept the steaks at a consistently good temperature for the duration of our meal, including for me, and I'm a fairly slow eater. We ordered steamed broccoli and potatoes au gratin as our sides. The potatoes were delicious. The broccoli was undercooked, but honestly were an afterthought and neither of us cared about it with all of the other delicious things we had at our fingers.

For dessert, we decided to treat ourselves and split two desserts. We ordered the chocolate sin cake, and at the suggestion of many other Yelp reviewers, I had to try the créme brûlée. The chocolate sin cake was very rich and delightfully textured. A few small bites was enough to sate my desire for anymore; it tasted delicious but was so very heavy and rich I couldn't eat much. The créme brûlée however, was easily one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had placed in front of me, and my husband agreed. The sugar was perfectly caramelized on top, which made a thin crispy layer on top of the decadently textured créme. It was like eating cream cheese air. My husband and I have already talked about taking a night to go sit at the bar and specifically order nothing but the créme brûlée. 

Overall we had an excellent experience here. The service was fantastic and all of the food, minus the broccoli (but really who cares about that) was truly fantastic. With the steep prices it's not something we will be doing often, but it was a great night of splurging and very much worth a night of spoiling ourselves.",2015-10-25 21:04:17

The forward and rear balconies overlooking the main level make for three separate and cozy seating area. The staff is also great. Friendly and really above and beyond excited and knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. The food menu is so creative and really the entire menu is made for sharing. My friend and I ordered two entrees and an app and split everything. The lamb burger entree comes with w/ the Pommes Frites which are served with chunks of garlic, seasoned with rosemary and served with a dipping aioli sauce. The burger itself was a bit juicy which made the bun soggy, though the burger was well done. The stinky cheese fondue it is served with....well....it stinks. The sogginess I think can be credited to the tangy yogurt sauce. The other entree we got was the hand ground beef filet of beef tartar. This was previously an app, now it's an entree though definitely not enough to fill you up if it's all you order.  It's served with some stadium mustard and the same aioli that came with the frites both on the side. Perched on top of the meat patty is 1, 3-minute egg. A 3-minute egg I found out is served stood upright, still in the shell with just the top knocked off. The yellow is runny for dipping and the white inside the shell is not 100% solidified either. The meat though however gross you may find the concept of beef tartar was really good! I was pleasantly surprised!! By taste I would say the beef was chilled just below room temperature. It was very flavourful, not chewy and not at all the odd texture I expected. For a first time tartar experience I have to say it was great! The app we got also shocked me! I'm not a wing guy - I never order them in sports bars and generally avoid them. The wings here though were amazing and I might come back just for them. They are called crispy chicken wings confit. The chicken just literally falls right off of the bone better than any wings I've ever eaten before. The dry sauce on the wings is also amazing and if I didn't have to go to a meeting after eating here without the opportunity to stop and use mouth wash before going I would have probably ate it all up: roasted jalapeño, lemon juice, lots of scallion & of course huge garlic pieces.

Our server was pleasant, though not enough to stand out as memorable. That wasn't the issue here, she did nothing wrong. This chain puts a spice on their home fried potatoes that to me makes them way too salty to eat. One time it was so bad that I had to send it back. When you order an item such as a skillet breakfast, they put these potatoes as the bed that the meals items lie on. In turn, the entire menu item tends to become incredibly salty. I tried it, and was rather shocked at the high salt/sodium level. I'm sure they would have been ""ok"" with us sending it back for this reason, but I'm surprised they don't get regular complaints about this. However, this was not even the main issue of our visit. They have an open (non screened,) ""pet friendly"" dine-in patio. We luckily chose to be seated inside the air conditioned restaurant. After we were seated, we noticed a fair amount of pigeons flying around on the patio. They were flying right by diners and even directly over where people were eating. They were flapping their wings, and making their presence known to all the diners that had the misfortune of eating out there. They were landing on the ground and eating food that had made its way to the floor. However, this wasn't even the worst part. A couple left quite a bit over on their plates upon their departure, and three or four of these birds landed on the table and began to chow down on the leftovers. They were standing on the plates (on the table) and really going to town. This continued for about 5 minutes or so, to our disgust. It wasn't until the hostess attempted to seat some more folks out there that they stopped, and they still didn't even fly away. They finally went to clean off the table, and the busser shoo'd them away. Not only was I disgusted, the words UNSANITARY and HEALTH HAZARD were flashing the color red in my head. Pigeons are not real clean members of the aviary family. It was so outlandish in my mind that I took to shooting pics & a video with my cell phone, I just couldn't believe it. I'm all for ""pet friendly"" environments, but this was just sickening to me that it was taken so nonchalantly and carefree. Like a scene out of the movie ""The Birds!""  A true feeding frenzy! I was sick to my stomach at a distance, if I was unfortunate enough to be eating out there while this was taking place I would have undoubtedly walked out on my meal.

Other things I noticed while there included:

A. My plate was filled with 75% of fried potatoes. Obesity in America is real. I'm all for decent portions but this was seriously beyond a normal serving for one person.

B. The hot sauce on the table says ""refrigerate after opening."" Do they replace the one on a table after its originally opened? I'm sure not. 

C. Waiting to pay at the front, nobody present to take our (or another party's money.) We had to go looking for somebody to man the register.

I have little problem with patio dining normally, but this was a perfect example of how an inexpensive option like a screen would go a long way. To whom it may concern, please do this before somebody ends up sick. I also understand that they don't control said birds, but if this a regular occurrence then the appropriate individual should take notice immediately.

I have eaten in other locations and have had little to no issues, but I'm not sure if this type of thing has ever been experienced by others here before myself. I myself nor whom I was dining with will not be returning.

My visit still gets 3 stars only due to my server wasn't the issue and what I myself ate was fine.

P.S. If anybody needs proof I have pics and a video. I'm not vindictive or I would have posted a pic here today lol.",2016-08-13 21:07:51

I dont consider myself a picky person when it comes to dining, but I do have a tolerance and a threshold concerning the quality of food and service.  Tonic has crossed that threshold too many times.

The guy that greeted us and served us wasn't very happy about something. Sorry we came in? Or... maybe he was just having a bad night idk but I didn't like how cold he was.. 

The food was pretty good tho. They have a special type of soy sauce that tasted yummy. 

And They have a late jught menu of cheap items.. maybe too cheap.

I ordered the poke bowl.. the flavor is there.. but the fish was not.. pretty sure there were like 7 pieces of fish.. wish there was more fish.. even off of the late night menu like regular size with more fish because it tasted yummy. 

I also ordered a chicken thigh skewer which was small but it was only 1.85 glad I ordered that because I wanted more protein from my poke bowl.

My man and his dad shared the supreme salmon roll. It was yummy!

No Horchata.  Boooo

Salsa NOT! It was like chunky Tomato Sauce and Ketchup.

0uoCCNJl4md4S5tjPLOMlA,ZrN6jjXI41GP7Oieae6CNQ,A2WqQ6J9a4iC15q53p3_CA,3,1,0,0,"As I've written in some of previous reviews for cycle shops, each one has its fans as well as detractors, and there are always pluses and minuses for each. Depending on who you ask, any given shop could run the gamut from horrible to great, but I find that the star rating that is most prevalent is probably the rating you should trust. It's with that in mind I give Duke's 3 stars. Here's why.

Duke's isn't a bad shop. It's not run down and the staff there haven't been rude to me when I've gone. Most people I've dealt with there were pretty nice actually. But the reason I give it 3 and not 4 or 5 stars is that in my experience there the customer service I've gotten has simply been just OK. A couple of the people were really really nice. A tall gentleman I spoke to about a specific bike they'd had before and a couple of the girls who work there were very polite. A gentleman with longish gray hair was not excessively rude but has never seemed that enthused and a couple times didn't even address me even though I was the only person on the floor. Another thing that I'm not crazy about is the layout. By far this is the biggest cycling store in Toronto, but the variety is not that great. Maybe it's because they wanted to specialize in the types of bikes I don't ride, but they typically only have a few fixed gear and they're not displayed in a way that makes them stand out so as to find them right away. The selection also says to me that they're looking to satisfy only the beginner rider (at a price roughly around $200 more than your average starting fixed) and the very high end ($2200-2300 for the Cevelo T1 last year and the new Cannondale around the same price this year). Nice bikes in the high end, nothing special on the lower end. I won't hold this against them too much as it may just not be their target market, but there are other things I don't like as much as other shops either. Whereas many cycle shops display the rims they sell so you can see them first hand and gauge what quality and aesthetic you want, Duke's keeps their rims downstairs where the customer can't see them. When I brought in my bike to replace the front wheel, they only had about 3-4 options. Not a fan. Also, it's definitely a store where it helps to know what you're talking about already. For instance, I got a Gatorskin tire there and they were charging $75 for it, whereas it's usually $55 max anywhere else. There is two types of Gatorskin so it may have been the pricier option, but it looked exactly the same as the one I already had which was $50, and I checked the specs on the tire so I feel pretty safe that it was the same version. I only bought it because it was an emergency replacement situation. Other examples are: Pedal straps ($11 at Duke's, $5 at Urbane), Inner tube ($12 at Duke's as opposed to about $7 anywhere else) and almost all accessories. 

The pros are the staff is mostly all friendly, they do have some pretty sweet bikes if you ride race or mountain or anything with gears, and they have an excellent selection of bike carriages for kids, racks for carrying stuff on your bike, and the store is spacious and clean. They have a great selection as well of Cervelo bikes, and also carry Cannondale and I believe Trek. They have a nice selection of parts and Brooks stuff and are full service. 

Overall not a place I find unpleasant to shop at but I'd probably only go there if I had something specific to buy such as the T1 or fluorescent green Cannondale Fixie. 

Generally too expensive. Better for starters than riders looking for an upgrade on parts.",2015-02-25 02:18:07

I've been coming to Karl's since I was allowed to walk down the street by myself as a kid. Then some years passed and I remember walking to Karl's every morning before in high school and getting a maple long john!!! These are by far my favorite treat here... but If you want one you better be there early because they seem to sell out because they are pretty popular!

Honestly the best bakery in town! They have everything from Chocolate covered strawberries to croissants! Fresh cookies and treats made daily too! a box of Karl's goodies always makes for a great treat to bring to a party or if you're just in a good mood you could bring some donuts too your co-workers ( they will love you forever)

I love that this bakery is family owned and operated! They staff (family) is always in a good mood! Having a party and need a special order? come to Karl's to get cookies, cake and other yummy treats that your guest will love! I recently was throwing a party to celebrate my mothers fifth year of being cancer free and I was going crazy with the treat and special details. I went in to The Bakers Daughters Chocolate shop (connected to the bakery) to talk to Cristine about doing a special order of truffles for me. She wasn't there so I left my name, number and Idea with the sweet girl who was working at the time. Not even and hour later Christine called me back to discus the details. She was amazing and had no problem answering all my questions and totally went above and beyond to make me exactly what I was looking for while still working within my budget! I'm so excited to see the final product but I'm sure the little ovarian cancer ribbon chocolates will be perfect!! I wouldn't expect anything less from this amazing place. 

Defiantly check out the new addition to Karl's which is called The Bakers Daughter! Everything is soooo amazing and she specializes in truffles! so many varieties my favorite is the roasted raspberry and the lavender! The truffles are a little pricey but defiantly worth it!!! They are priced in weight and are about 11$ for a 100 grams ** which comes out to around 99 cents for the normal truffles and about 1.20$ for the gourmet ones!!!

The person taking orders seems to know a lot of people, must be a lot of regulars. They ask ""do you want your usual"" or ""at this time, she wants..."". They must really take their job seriously, if I came here multiple times, that'd make me feel special.

It has some nice tables for studying or working, a big table in the back for bigger groups. I've come here at night a few times for meetups, and usually there is a table available and the right level of noise where I don't have to yell or anything.

They had a list of lunch items and I chose the Pad Thai Chicken. Seems like a lot of people order there for lunch because it took them 45 minutes to give me my order. It looks like it would be a hole in the wall but when you enter its pretty big. Kinda old school they had the beetles posters on the wall along with some vinyl discs.

 I thought the pad thai would be served just by itself but they also included a big scoop of rice a side salad and an eggroll. The pad thai was good, could use a little bit more flavor than spice. Lots of pieces of chicken and bean sprouts. 

Overall my lunch was good, kind of a small serving but I paid less than $10 so I cant go wrong with that. Next time I would like to try that place for dinner and see how really good their other dishes are.",2014-09-10 19:33:45

I had a super crush on him (damn you Stephanie March) and was super excited in 2000 when I went to Mesa Grill in 2000. At the time, it was probably one of the best meals I had ever had. Literally. 

Fast-forward some years and I decided to check out the Mesa Grill in Las Vegas. It was a while ago that we went but I had the fish and my husband had a steak. Obviously we drank margaritas. The food was really good, but not exceptional like I recalled. I think they kind of went overboard with the condiments. Although not super authentic, I would say that this is still better quality food than most Mexican places on the strip and would kinda compare it to Rick Bayless.",2013-05-07 23:42:17

High notes: 

Naan. Easily some of the best naan I've had in town. Served piping hot, holds a great chew, serves at the unparalleled vehicle for all things Indian. It was awesome. 

Saffron Almond Paneer. This is a great passed plate and has tons of different flavors to choose from -- sweet, mild spice, herby. The paneer inside the naan was wonderful. 

The whole traditional side of the menu is great. Plenty to choose from and definitely doesn't disappoint with the portions served. We were all thrilled with our entrees and shared plenty with one another. Which goes to show, the pricepoint with the given portion, in my opinion, is rather fair. They brought us so much extra naan, rice, and there was plenty for all of us to enjoy individually as well as share amongst the table. 

Three of us made it out under $70 (no alcohol) and we were stuffed. The menu is definitely a bit pricier than other places in town -- Avg around $18/person. However, I wouldn't let the prices deter coming back at all. The amount of food, ambiance (the patio is gorgeous on a temperate evening), stellar/professional service, and location with ample parking makes the price per dish a non-issue. Or.....naan issue. 

Looking forward to checking out their sister restaurant in Ballantyne -- The Blue Taj.

Supurb steaks......
Lobster mashed potatoes........
Super sushi rolls...
Excellent seafod.....
An extensive wine list 
Buttercake with real whipped cream for dessert ...... oh yeahhhhhh

The location is very unique, in that you can sit out on a terrace in an art deco treehouse and under some beautiful chandeliers.
The service is very good, the wait staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.
We had an enjoyable evening topped off by a table visit from Lucianna, the manager.

We were recommended to enjoy ""Earthquake"" an excellent Cabernet Sauvignon
from the Lodi vineyards, California.
I would pass that recommendation on to you - if you are enjoying the fine steaks....... 
It is an absolutely supurb wine selection.

At first I was sceptical of the Lobster mashed potatoes, but the 
dish is a real treat.... 
and the portion is so huge that it can be shared by all at the table.

8) Chuck-A-Puck... it's a fundraiser deal.... you buy rubber pucks and throw them on the ice for a chance to win a gift card for food or a signed jersey or something like that

9) McMullan's is just a hop, skip and a jump away and that place is awesome before and after the game.... really good Irish fare

There are a plethora of sports bars and places to go, but I am still searching for the place that has the perfect amount of TVs, great food, and awesome service.

This BWW is located in Rivergate, in the south Charlotte burbs.  You have to drive out, pass Carowinds, and still go a little further to reach it, but there are plenty of parking spaces... It is tucked in behind the main shopping center intersection so probably contributes to less of a crowd inside.

The staff is nice-enough, but they weren't completely slammed and busy... so I expected service to be on par (and it was).  I ended up getting a new offering on their menu.. a sampler (which now that I think about it... is probably not new - just new to me)..... So 5 wings, chili-cheese fries, cheese curds, and fried pickles.  Wings were okay.  The curds and fried pickles were good (hard to mess up anything fried)... the fries came with FRESH-CUT jalapenos WITH seeds... so each fry bite ended up being a fun game of ""am I going to feel my tongue after this"" but we survived.

We had a little one with us (yes my friends have offspring now) so they were accommodating and luckily, she was very good that afternoon having a nice long nap before we headed out to watch football.

My last visit was this past Saturday just after lunch. I watched the gentleman mixing the salads and he looked really miserable to be there. When I finally got to order my salad the guy asked my wife what her name was, she didn't hear him, so he barked out the question once more. There were no pleasantries and he smacked every item into our FCN salad like it owed him money. I will not be going back to Crisp. Showmars across the street makes great salads and appreciate every customers patronage.

The next level of dissatisfaction came when we paid. We got one salad between the two of us along with two drinks. The girl at the counter looked frazzled and charged us twice the actual total.  I don't think she was purposely trying to cheat us, but she was just careless, a symptom of a lot of the restaurants in the area. She made it right, so no worries.

I am rare to judge a small business harshly because I am also in business for myself. But if the owner is reading this, please teach your employees to care about how they treat customers. That is not too much to ask.",2012-08-20 20:26:38

In a downtown core where giants like Pai, Khao San Road, and Sukho Thai thrive, as well as popular student establishments like Salad King, there's...this place that's relatively unknown along Yonge Street. In fact, it's so hidden that it's only accessible via a set of stairs that's very unassuming (the stairs claim it leads to a massage parlour; it doesn't until the third floor!).

Thai On Yonge is an excellent restaurant for someone who wants down to earth Thai food, without the drawn out hype (it never got crowded when I was here). The costs are also substantially lower, and personally I feel the place is better quality than Salad King next door. 

The seating arrangement is a little awkward (lots of weirdly designed booths), but I wasn't bothered too much. You seat yourself, although informing an employee of your arrival would help in getting better service.

I ordered the chicken padthai lunch special, which came with one spring roll and a soup of the day, which turned out to be hot and sour soup. Both the soup and spring roll were quite good, definitely excellent quality for the price I paid ($9 including taxes with the pad thai). The pad thai came after; this restaurant separates the bean sprouts and peanuts, so if you don't like either addition, well, they did the job for you!

Again, for $9 including tax, this is probably one of the best pad thais you can get in the city for under $10. The sauce was done right, the noodles were chewy but not undercooked, and the presentation was nicely done as well. The food came quick enough that I was in and out in about 40 minutes; not bad at all!

Service was excellent once you're seated. The employees are legit Thai people, so you know you're getting the authenticity of Thai food here without breaking your bank.

Definitely will return!",2016-02-13 20:50:52

Bonus marks for: Lots of young woman and its open late for night time snack!!!

We were greeted with a young, friendly server who brought our bread, I assume its some sort of baguette with some balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil. I was hungry, so I consumed most of the bread...=)

We started things off with their grilled calamari...The calamari tasted rubbery to me, and dry tasting. It was served on arugula tomato mixed with balsamic sauce. I would say that I've definitely had better calamari elsewhere, and would probably not order this dish again here...

2nd thing was the pizza...I forgot the name of the pizza, but the toppings had goat cheese, roasted red peppers and other veggies on it...The plus side for this pizza is the crust tasted alright, but kind of bland to me without sauce. I definitely envisioned that goat cheese would make pizza taste creamier but not for this one. I vouch for great tasting pizza at 'Pizzeria Libretto'!

Total bill was $28 after tax! Would anyone say that's standard or overpriced?

This place wasn't bad, it was like a cute little restaurant inside a convenience store. The choices were very very limited and were, in my honest opinion, all kind of the same thing.
I had no idea that dynamite rolls were just a west coast thing; I asked and the waitress had no idea what I was talking about-- but they were more than willing to roll up a custom order which was nice.
I also got to try my first ever sushi pizza. I had no idea that was a thing (Montreal/east coast thing?) but my goodness, it was yummy. 
It was pretty pricey for the quality and lack of quantity; I think with my friend we spent about $65. But I can understand why seafood would be more expensive here.
Finally, just a general thought about the Japanese places that I've researched about here. I'm very surprised that they only either offer just rolls/cones or just hot foods.. But not both. Maybe they offer both at the very expensive $300+ places?

Also had the mac and cheese which I really enjoyed. Would I order it again? Probably not but it's something worth trying.

I tried their parsnip soup which was good. The main reason why I ordered it was because of the pumpkin seeds in the soup. I was disappointed with the pumpkin seed because I thought they were going to make the seed crispy but it was too soft for my liking. The soup itself was delicious.

The sweet potato fries here are good but they added too much salt. I enjoy my sweet potato fries with a bit of salt and pepper because I think it enhances the sweet taste but they went a bit overboard with the salt.

The roast duck poutine pizza was a disaster in my opinion. I never really enjoy poutine pizza but with that aside, the duck was way to dry. The fries reminded me of KFC fries (nothing wrong with that for those who like KFC fries but I don't like KFC fries). I guess I'm not the kind of girl that enjoys just putting anything on her pizza.

For dessert, I tried the smore's and it's not that great. The graham cracker was a bit soggy and there wasn't enough of it. It reminded me of a lava cake. Go for the tart if you're craving dessert.

Another highlight of the meal was the Mighty Canuck. I absolutely love that drink! The glass is sugar rimmed and there's a sugared orange chocolate candy on top of the drink. I also tried the Back Forty (I think that's what it's called) and there's too much cucumber taste in that.

No problem u guys are busy we can see BUT as time went we noticed there was a box of food behind the counter and we got to thinking I wonder if it is ours. Sure enough it was and she had no idea. Then she checked the bag told us I have to get your dessert excuse me. We waited as she asked around, my coworker says I bet $20 it was in the bag the whole time. Well I'm glad I didn't shake on it. It was in the bag and not only in the bag but the first thing placed in the bag. Sooooo not only did u not communicate about our food but u put ICE CREAM at the bottom of a hot food bag...

This place is good for 4- people, any more it gets too crowded.
We ordered the Kookminhakgyo assorted set ($57.99 for 4 servings) which included pork skirt meat, pork shoulder, pork jowl meat, and pork belly. We had 6 people, which wasn't enough food for us so we also tried the beef skirt meat ($23.99 for 200g of meat), and an order pork jowl meat ($14.99 for 200g). 
The meat are fresh and you can tell it's good quality meat. I didn't really like the beef skirt meat, thought the meat was slightly tough for me. I liked the pork more, pork jowl being the best in my opinion as it was the most tender one. I didn't like how the meat were not marinated, but I'm guessing that's the authentic way of eating it. You marinate it yourself with all the provided sauces, green onions and then wrap it in the lettuce. The red paste and black pepper/salt/oil sauce was good. I actually didn't like the sauce that was in the jar (bbq sauce i think?). 
I think the best thing we had at this restaurant was the steamed egg! The egg was SO soft and SO fluffy, and flavorful, it was amazing. One pot comes free but it was so good we actually ordered another one even though we had to pay for it. I don't know why it's so good but it's the best steamed egg I've had at a korean restaurant.

Service was good, quite attentive and fast with serving. One thing I also really liked was how you can store your belongings inside the seat you are sitting on - this is smart cause then your jacket or bag won't smell like BBQ!

6. It is super affordable!

My favorite dishes are Thai Basil, Pra Ram, Red and Panang Curry and the pineapple fried rice.

You walk in to the intoxicating smell and sizzle of grilled meat, and there is a huge open mesquite grill just inside the entrance. There's something to be said about doing one thing and doing it well - the grilled steak and chicken are definitely the stars of the show. The menu is similar to Chipotle as you pick your protein and can have it one of four ways - in a taco, burrito, quesadilla, or protein bowl. As it was Taco Tuesday, I had a chicken and a steak taco for $2 each. I added a side of rice and beans and a fountain drink and the entire tab was less than $10. And you get a TON of food. The tacos themselves are pretty basic - flour or corn tortilla, choice of meat, cheese, guac But you can head over to their condiment bar and really load them up! The pico de gallo is super fresh and tasty. Top it off with a squeeze of fresh lime and their amaaaazing green sauce and you have a feast! They also have cabbage and onions for those who are inclined. Both meats were incredible flavorful and tender, though I was partial to the steak.

Valentine's weekend and cafe a la ""my house"" was the idea. My sweetie and I love cafes and sugary treats after active city days. Since I don't know of any late night bakery cafes in Pittsburgh like in Boston I created the atmosphere.

A long weekend was in the works so I picked up an assortment from under the glass. Everything looked like edible art. I started with a Napoleon, then a pistachio eclair with a chocolate on top, a round chocolate mini cake, a lemon tart, and a chocolate croissant. It is so inviting in that little shop, not just because of the aromas coming from the front door.  The tea selection is amazing too. I buy my tea from the same company online bc it is not sold in stores and it is the best. 

The first night we had the Napoleon. I was expecting something like from the Italian bakery. It did not have the light custard in it, more like a dense cake with layers of chocolates. It was delicious but not quite what I was craving.

The green eclair was the next night. Amaaazing. Light, delicate, pistachio cream and fall apart in your mouth custard. I stole an extra bigger bite on this one. We also had the buttery perfect croissant this evening. Paired with my agave sweetened, vanilla, and cream tea it was better than sitting in the cafe.

The next afternoon I started nibbling the lemon tart. Just one bite. Sweet and lemon with a butter crumble crust. It was gone in no time.

Last but not least the chocolate mousse mini cake. I'm going to admit we are cheesy and we ate it in bed, sharing bite after perfectly moussey, chocolaty, heavenly bite.  This one was denser like the first dessert but more of a chocolate overload. Mr. B's favorite. I loved the pistachio eclair best. After a long weekend all the desserts held up and tasted fresh.

We have been looking for authentic Mexican food here in Phoenix and not having to drive to Tucson to find it.  Don't take this wrong, there are some really good Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, but Tucson has great Mexican food! 

Caramba's is more of a dive-ish / dinner style restaurant that offers quick and friendly service and really good (almost to greatness) food.  They were voted ""Best of Phoenix"" and Best Mexican Restaurant"" by Hispanic Newspapers.  They are extremely low cost and offer HUGE serving sizes. What I like the most about Caramba's is they do not use lard nor MSG!  You can tell their food is extremely fresh and they offer several LOW CARB options for the healthy conscious. 

My Chipotle loving friend left this place vowing never to eat at Chipotle again after eating their Machaca Beef Burito. Their Machaca Beef Buro is HUMUNGUS and very tasty!  Their chicken and shrimp Quesadilla's were also delicious and HUGE. They were served on a pizza pan for goodness sake!  Their carne asada and and pollo asado are also very good. They give you a bowl of warm, homemade chips and have a salsa bar.  The two things that are keeping my experince from being 5 stars:

1)  Yes they have a salsa bar and their salsa is very good but they give you these little salad dressing size cups to put it in.  They are so small you can't fit a chip in them...

2)  They charge you for soft drink and ice tea refills.  I appreciate the fact they serve a good variety of domestic and foreign beer but sometimes you just want ice tea, especially during lunch. No one charges for tea refills!

Tasty Fusion is now in the place where Leslie Cafe used to occupy.  If you ask me, the fusion part means fusion between a traditional Chinese restaurant and a HK style cafe. 

Pros:
Items from both Chinese restaurants and HK style cafe available 
Food comes out quick

Cons:
Prices are a bit higher

This was my first time here since Tasty Delight took over.  First thing to notice is the decor has completely changed for the better.  It feels like a family restaurant now.  There's more seating and the booths are much more comfortable than before.  It also has a much cleaner feel than before.

One look at the menu and you see that Tasty Fusion offers items you can find at both Chinese restaurants and HK style cafes.  This is great when you have a group where some people want to go one way and some want the other.  The menu is split up between the two as well.  As like HK stlye cafes, all items are that part of the menu come with a drink and soup.  The menu has a lot of items to choose from as well.  They even have a Chinese banquet style menu that you see at the larger Chinese restaurants, crazy!!

I ordered the baked chicken in cream sauce with cheese and spinach  and my GF got a won ton noodle.  The food comes out rather fast, I think we got both our orders well within 10 minutes of ordering.  Strangely, my baked rice came out before the won ton noodle.  Baked rice should take a lot longer to make??  Anyways, the presentation of the food here is well done.  For the most part, I liked my baked rice.  I would of preferred more of the sauce though.   It was mostly only over the chicken, there was barely any over the rice.  My GF's won ton noodle was well portioned.  You get 5 won tons that are made with all shrimp inside or at the very least, little to no filler at all.  The food overall was good, not the best, but well above serviceable.

The prices here are a bit higher than other places.  My baked rice went for $10.95.  I can get the same thing at other places for about $8-9 depending on the place.  It's a bit of a premium.  The service is excellent though.  As soon as they see you have a little one, they change up the bowls and utensils with child friendly ones.  They were pretty nice throughout the entire meal and were quick when you called.  

I like the idea behind having a Chinese restaurant with a HK style cafe all in one.  You get a great experience albeit with a little bit of a pricing premium.  This one of the very few HK stlye cafe's in North York and it holds up well.  Seeing this is the closest HK style cafe to me, I will be back in the future.",2015-07-29 11:47:58

XUAR8EltaGyzF11nMtVJ2Q,XXKjsdglgwSs9kWtK6ZWUQ,LHXisknIbUy_XtdEQc7x9w,1,7,3,2,"This place is horrible.  My friend wanted to rent a car for a trip to Cali.  She had only rented once before years ago and wasn't familiar with the process.  I suggested a few companies I had used in the past and she ended up making reservations with Advantage.  Who until this point I had never heard of.  I gave her a ride to the rental car center and went inside to make sure she got the car before I left.  I admit I was a little leery.  We waited in line for about 15 min when out of nowhere comes a girl telling my friend to make sure she has her id and credit card out rather rudely.  My friend had both in her hand ready.  So she showed her and the girl says ok good rude again.  We just kinda look at each other at this point.  I understand being prepared which is why we already had it in hand but we are the only ones in line.  It wasn't like they were busy and no need to be a bitch about it.  

Finally it is our turn and the customer service agent couldn't have been more miserable.  Rude, talking low, not making eye contact, asking for things rudely we already gave him.  Then he ask my friend if she has her insurance.  Insurance?  He makes this hand gesture to a sign waaay over on the company next to them and is like yeah don't you see the sign?  Ummm no I didn't read the little sign, across the counter at the other company we are not renting from.  Sorry about that Sir.  My friend pulls up her car insurance on her app and gives it to him.  He is messing with her phone and can't figure it out.  He has to go get a manager who says they can't accept it because it is to far in advance.  I'm sorry what?  I have to much insurance?  Turns out she had 2 cards on the app one for this policy that went through June and one that was her next policy July-Dec.  When he was messing around he swiped out of the correct card.  Not a big deal if he wasn't such an asshole.  Telling her that she doesn't have insurance and that it hasn't started yet.  When that is finally sorted they go into all their upselling of insurance (after all that why would we buy their insurance), navigation, upgrading to a convertible.  It goes on and on.  He wouldn't give up at no either.  No I don't need navigation.  Are you sure?  Yes I'm sure I'm going home to California I know how to get there.  Well you never know....It went on and on for every sell.  Convertible would be nice in California,  actually it is supposed to rain this week, really well it would still be nice.  He probably gets commission or kick backs from up sells, he should be nicer to people.  I wouldn't buy one extra from him just from his attitude alone.  Then he went in to how many drivers and how many passengers (my friend was travelling alone).  He kept asking over and over and then looking at me.  Then he would ask her questions to try and trick her, like we were sneaking and I was going too.  She kept telling him its just me.  Finally I had enough and was like dude I'm her ride.  I'm not going with her and jingled my keys at him.  It was ridiculous.  I was mainly staying around cause I wasn't sure if she was going to get a car after all this.  I'm sure people try and pull fast ones on him but really no excuse for the way we were treated start to finish.",2015-06-21 19:49:37

We ordered the poached egg on your face panini, oquf coquette, caesar, and the elixir + bourbon. The panini was great. The bread was crunchy and fresh while the slow roasted tomatoes complemented the spicy poached eggs perfectly. My companion wasn't too impressed with her oeuf coquette. She felt that there was not enough flat bread to finish the coquette.

Be warned if you are a lightweight, the drinks here are very strong. They put an interesting spin on their caesar as it tastes more like a vegetable cocktail than the traditional tomato beverage. The bourbon was nice and strong.

This is a typical breakfast you would get anywhere else, but their pancakes were nice and fluffy and their french toast was really good, too. 

The hot and honey chicken wrap was also a huge portion. I was forewarned that the wrap would be spicy and I appreciated the clarification. The wrap itself is a little juicier than I would have liked, but I was only able to finish half, so I'm going to throw the other half in the oven for dinner later and I'm sure that will solve the problem. Filled to the brim with chicken, tomato, and onion, this meal is really two in one. Fries were standard. I know frozen fries when I see them.

The carne asada is just alright, better flavors there from spice, but im never a fan of well done beef. 

Packaged tortillas are just lazily thrown on the grill for a few seconds to warm up and not even flavored, or seasoned, or given a light browning or crisping for texture. The just serve as a soggy vehicle for your taco meats. 

The salsa bar is the star, the green tomatillo sauce brings you serious heat that creeps on you at the end. The chunky smoked jalapeno ""relish"" is also a delicious spicy topping. 

Service is friendly and they do a great job of moving quickly thru a large group of people.

Usually that's not a good sign for me but I always give the benefit of the doubt. First thing I noticed was how smoky the place was. There seems to be no ventilation of any sort but surprisingly, no one seemed bothered by it.  Atmosphere is  dark and intimate, perfect for the dinner occasion I was at. 

Started out with some oysters which are part of the special. They were fresh and plump. My favorite has to be their little skookum oysters which were really sweet and fresh. 

Grilled branzino with sweet potato. Holy moly. Grilled and seasoned perfectly. Fish was boneless and was grilled with lemons and bunch of different herbs. 

Waffle fries. The dipping sauce was bomb.com! It was a creamy aeoli sauce with some tangyness and was perfect with their crispy waffle fries.

Flavor parade.  I guess it is good to be intoxicated while trying something new because you get to be adventurous. Lesson learned.

Steamed mussels in a pot. It was a recommended dish but turned out to be ok. Mussels were small and nothing mind blowing. 

Fantastic flavorful seafood dish heaven with impeccable service. I hope to be back soon.",2016-04-12 04:32:17

Unlike our recent visit to the Mesa location, we had to wait about 45 mins. What set this apart, was the fact the hosts brought out a fresh, hot pizza cut into tiny sample sized pieces for all those waiting. I've never seen this level of service before. At any restaurant!

My youngest leaned over and asked me ""Is it really worth the wait?"" I told him he would see soon. And once we were seated, our orders were taken promptly. And then the pizza arrived. He chose the same pizza his brother wanted for his birthday... How like them.

Our Clark Street Meat Pizza was amazing. As always! And our server was super cool. I am embarrassed that I can't recall his name, but he definitely delivered the experience we have come to expect from Oregano's.

And just like the previous visit, the meal was concluded with an awesome Pizzookie! Thanks to Glendale for a great meal and overall experience!",2018-07-17 17:19:59

You walk in and you see lots of long benches for seating. It's open seating so you do not get seated. You seat yourself. On the left side of the place is the bar with a large selection of craft beers. Probably 20 beers on tap and 80+ in bottles available. 

On the left side of the place is the food ordering location. They specialize in Wvrst, hence the name. I must say the Duck Foie Gras sausage is by far my most favourite sausage. You get to pick 2 toppings such as Sauerkraut, sweet onions etc. And whether you want it on a bun or not. Their duck fries are also very amazing. No one can argue fries fried in duck fat. When ordering is done they give you a number sign to bring to your table and they bring the food to you.

On weekends there is quite a line to get in but it's not very long at all as this place is more of an in and out place to eat. It is located on King West so be weary about the parking and busyness of the clubs and bars surrounding it.

My suggestion is to hit up Lee's restaurant next door for a nice dinner then go for a post dinner drink and late night snack at Wvrst.

if you are ever not happy then you can go across the street to the Bier Market.

Highly recommended and definitely worth the trip to this place. Too bad they don't have their sausages available to buy at grocery stores. I'd be all over that.",2015-01-18 22:26:37

My boyfriend got a Yuengling which was considerably more reasonably priced.After reviewing the menu, we decided we wanted to make a pizza with prosciutto, mushrooms, and olives. Unfortunately, after ordering our server-who was incredibly warm,helpful, and attentive -came back and told us they were out of the prosciutto so we settled for pepperoni. The pizza, of course, was ""well done"" around the edges, however, the center was considerably underdone. The flavors were great and the pizza would have been excellent had it not been for the undercooked center. Overall, we will probably not be back-we had a total of 3 drinks (1 glass of wine,2 yuenglings) and the pizza and our bill was pushing $60.00 which is more than we had originally expected to spend for a quick bite to eat after a movie.And, as I said before, the pizza, although the flavors were good was undercooked in the center-which did not ruin the pizza entirely but came close to it.

His parents had gotten us a very generous gift card to use for exactly that purpose since they live far away and couldn't be here to celebrate with us.  Based on all the great reviews, we decided to spend it here.

I wouldn't go so far as to say it was the best steakhouse we've ever been to, but it was pretty damn good. We ordered Blue Point oysters, which were fresh and delicious. The sauteed scallops were absolutely to die for. It comes with bread to dip in the buttery sauce and it was so amazing.  Then we ordered a filet, the sea bass, lobster mashed potatoes and Gorgonzola mac n cheese. While still very tasty, each item had some issues.  The lobster in the mashed potatoes were a bit overcooked and slightly chewy.  The mac n cheese had no hint of Gorgonzola at all and as soon as it slightly cooled while sitting at our table, the thick top layer of cheese became hard and rubbery.  The filet was good and perfectly cooked, but I've had much better steak elsewhere.  And last, the sea bass wasn't the melt in your mouth buttery bite of heaven as I expected. 

The service is great. Everyone said congratulations since we had put that we were celebrating our engagement in the reservation details. Our server was super busy but she checked on us often. The ambiance is definitely strange as you're in a mall. It's really loud and not intimate at all. You're very close to other tables. Ours was right on the back of a booth, and the guys in that booth kept accidentally knocking over our table lamp.

Problem with the Blue Hound is there are too many choices nearby to make coming back a possibility. It may feel cool, but a lot of other places nearby feel cool, too. It's worth a visit just to check it out, but then ... it will never enter your mind again.

The Whoohoos!! - Beautifully decorated, great feeling and vibe, as another reviewer stated. It feels like a nice change of pace for Phoenix restaurants. The poolside bar is awesome and I'd go back there before this place.

The Sad Pandas - Happy hour SUCKS. I work nearby and go out at least one night a week and the Blue Hound will not be on our rotation list. ""But why?"" you ask ...

Set the scene ... four women out after work. Not looking for dinner, just some snacks while we have a drink or two and catch up.

Popcorn - sounds nummy! Not if you want more than two handfuls. For $6, we were delivered a teeny, tiny wooden bowl that you'd expect salsa to come in. In it was two medium sized handfuls of this caramel popcorn (and a lot of kernels and broken pieces). This should be given to the table gratis, if you're going to give something so small.

Deviled eggs - Wow, the presentation was beautiful I felt like Gordon Ramsey must have perfectly placed and spaced the eggs on the plate. And the four of us, now totally stuffed from our half a handful of popcorn stare down at three deviled eggs. Good thing Maria was on a diet, of else we'd have to arm wrestle for who got the eggs.

Drinks - not the worse priced, not the best. Problem was our waiter didn't seem to have a Fing clue about their unique lineup of beers. I asked for something light and summery - to which he suggest a ""summer shandy.""

Assuming this summer shandy was the same as every other summer shandy I've had (beer mixed with lemonade), I agreed to try it on the waiter's ""It's amazing""

What I was given haunts me in my dreams. A oddly shaped beer glass was delivered with a light, almost water color and a GIANT FREAKING CUCUMBER stuck in it. 

Was I supposed to put this on my eyes? The drink smelled like a combination of facial moisturizer and salad ... both appealing combos in a drink.

That's about when my friend found the drink in their table top menu and pointed out the $10 price tag and list of liquor. This was NOT a normal summer shandy and the waiter should have told me and either pointed to it in the menu and listed the price. Granted, $10 isn't horrible, but what if I was watching my money?  When someone is trying to spend my money to raise his bill and tip, be honest with me or I'll slam your tip and warn others to be wary of the wait staff at the Blue Hound.

0UGMdZJtc4-6BsHkLskaLg,DSDL_v5dvLOIJ-o5sRhz4w,_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ,4,2,0,2,"I do really enjoy the food here.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because when I want to have a very nice meal with conversation and great food, atmosphere, I would want a more quiet, fine dining restaurant. When OC is busy, it's loud, even when you're in the back section...I guess that's just not my cup of tea for a formal dinner.  

That said, if you want fun people/cougar watching and throw back a few glasses of wine or cocktails, sit in the bar area and have a great meal, with almost as good service as any other table.  

Their shrimp cocktail-LOVE LOVE! best mix your own cocktail sauce with a huge portion of fresh horseradish to make it hot like I love!  If you are splitting this make sure you request to add one more shrimp, since it only comes with 3. It comes extravagantly with dry ice spewing out underneath it. Very nice presentation.  Salads are huge and just so-so.  Ruth's Chris has better crab cakes, oysters rockefeller-just okay...Bread bowl is yummy, assorted warm breads of all sorts!

The great part:

Chilean Sea Bass Oreganata style (lightly seasoned bread crumbs soaked and crisped in BUTTER)  This is a large portion and I always end up splitting it. If you really want to splurge, they have the absolute best lobster mashed potatoes!  The lobster is layered out on top, not mixed in, as to not make the potatoes fishy tasting.  It's a huge portion with a good amount of lobster and  topped with more butter! Potatoes are super creamy but not overly whipped up, they have some texture to them. It is definitely a decadent dish and can potentially be a very heavy meal for 2. The creamed spinach is killer too!

One of my all time favorite desserts is their BUTTER CAKE...{Is this becoming a theme here? }  It is slightly sweet, slightly crispy on the outside, 'light' and fluffy on the inside, comes warm with fresh fruit and a giant bowl a fresh whipped cream.  It is to die for!",2010-07-09 18:56:33

And it's not obvious by looking at the place that such wonderful food resides inside that door. We intended to try Coca Cafe for brunch but the line was far too long so we decided, based on Yelp reviews, to go up the hill and try Caffe Mona since it was so close. WOW. Amazing. The place is small but it has a deck out back that, in good sunny weather, offers a great place to sit, relax, and enjoy some good food.

Great menu selections include a prix fix 3 course brunch for $13.99 - includes unlimited coffee, a fresh fruit plate (tons of fruit!), and entree, and a dessert crepe. That's what we chose but I don't think we could have gone wrong with anything on that menu. I got the Mediterranean omelet which was done to perfection with peppers, olives and feta cheese. My wife got the savory French toast with brie, fig preserves, and slices of granny smith apples on a thick piece of French toast. She claims this may have been the best breakfast dish she's ever had. I tried it (imagine that!) and concur - it truly was amazing. People next to us got the berry stuffed French toast which, I admit, I drooled over. Even with a full stomach I would have taken a bite if they had offered. He couldn't finish his and took half home.

The crepe was the only disappointment - it tasted like it had been made ahead of time and was a little hard. I know crepes and they should be thin, served warm, and not crunchy in the least. I'm willing to forgive it since by the time that was served, I could barely eat another bite. All in all it was a great place. GREAT place. I'm ready to go back.",2012-09-11 23:54:48

I was really craving some nice cold nengmyun and my friend and I decided to come give this place a try. The restaurant was not very busy and we were seated right away. When we tried to order the nengmyun the server said they ran out. We were supper bummed and we're getting ready to leave. My friend and I were trying to find other Korean restaurants that had it but most of them are closed on a Tuesday so we really didn't have much options to pick from. Thankfully our server came back and said they just made some broth so we were able to get it. Our food came out fairly fast and the side dishes were good. My favorite was the steamed egg they brought out! Everything about our dish looked yummy! The broth was really flavorful , the noodles were soft and I liked that they gave us more then one piece of meat. I don't understand why restaurants do that for some of their dishes. 
Anyways it definitely satisfied my cravings and it was the perfect way to beat the heat. This time my experience was way better then the one I had a couple of years ago and I will be back!",2016-07-04 01:17:42

d2rLhNeCWT8UqqHYfZtsiQ,un2KUxPNvUOZDuUYoN-FQg,FirWX-Ep5203TsdiGgShKg,2,4,0,1,"I had visited the Vig Arcadia sometime last year and was underwhelmed at my experience but seeing a Local Dines for the Vig Uptown, I decided it would be worth trying it again at a different location. 

We tried to call ahead and get on the list around 6:15pm on Friday night. While they don't let you call ahead and put your name on the list, the hostess said it would only be a 20-30 minute wait and she thought it could be faster so even though we were starving, we decided to head out. 

We arrived about 30 minutes later and the valet parking was a bit confusing. We pulled up to the valet stand and no one was there. Just beyond the stand there was a sign that said the lot was full so I got out and looked around for someone to help us. About that time, the valet came up while I was still standing next to the car. He instructed my fiance  to pull up the car another 20 feet to the front door and then took the car to be parked. Not sure why he couldn't have taken it there and it seemed a little odd but I figured they were pretty busy. 

We entered and no one was at the hostess stand initially. Someone appeared a few minutes later but didn't seem to be in charge of the area and ignored me. Finally, a friendly hostess appeared and put us down and said it would be 20-30 minutes. We stood in the corner since the 4 cube seats were taken. I thought about maybe sitting on the patio to wait until every person that come from outside reeked like smoke. I overheard her mention to someone else that it was the 'smokers patio'...so much for fresh air so you might keep that in mind if you're hoping to sit outside. After a 35 minute wait, we were finally taken to our table.

As we sat down in our booth and realized how loud it was, we decided to sit on the same side so we could hear each other. It was crowded but it still shouldn't have been as loud as it was. Our waitress came after a few minutes and took our drink and appetizer order. We opted for the wings and the tater tots. Someone arrived with the wings a few minutes later and we figured the tots would be out shortly. With the wings nearly gone, she finally came back to check on us and when we asked about the tot's, she said she hadn't heard our order and she would get them out fast. Totally couldn't blame her though since it was so loud. I didn't try the wings but my fiance said they were 'okay'. 

We ordered the Carne Asada to share for dinner, figuring the tots would fill us up. Shortly after she left, the tots came out. While they were huge and I think you get 6 or 7, they weren't great. The first one I ate had no cheese in it and the dipping sauce didn't taste like much. The tots didn't have a whole lot of flavor either and I would have preferred frozen Ore Ida over these! I kept trying to salt them but nothing helped. I asked the person who brought the tots for a side of ranch and also a refill on my drink.  The ranch arrived a few minutes later and then the refill another 3-5 minutes after that. 

We did finally receive our dinner too and while it was very tender and had good flavor, our whole experience so far had kind of trumped the dinner. Our waitress disappeared forever and never came to check back on us to see how our dinner was. When she eventually did reappear, she apologized for the wait and I think she said 'Sorry for the wait, I kept cutting myself and I had to take care of that first'...HUH? I still am not 100% sure what she said but that's sure what it sounded like. She did bring the bill and thankfully our bill was only $7 after the local dines credit. It took another lengthy amount of time to get the check to sign but she did apologize...again...for taking so long. 

When we left, we were at least thanked for coming in. When we walked out someone held the door open for us and thanked us too. Then began another valet fiasco. Our car was 3rd in line parked and just across from the valet stand. We walked up to the stand but nobody was there except a man, who I assumed was waiting for his car. Then someone appeared, took out our keys and then said he would be back to help us and laid our keys on the stand. Having our car 20 feet away and rather than have to wait around for him to help someone else and THEN pull out our car, we grabbed our keys and started walking over to our car. Instead, we were scalded by another valet that he would move our car and informed us 'there is a line'. You mean the one guy now standing by the valet being helped? Whatever. I get these urban places have crappy parking but this whole valet is such a joke. I know they have a system for how they get cars in and out of the parking lot but its chaotic and they were never friendly and we were just ready to go.  At this point, both the Vig's have struck out in my opinion and I'll find other places to dine. 

One star for the ambiance (because it's swanky inside and might be a cool patio but it would be so much more enjoyable without all the noise) and another for...the carne asada?",2013-09-07 18:17:38

I really really wanted to love Gio's.  It's quirky and fun inside, I like the menu, and it's not far from home.  Unfortunately, I am not in love.  The first time I visited it was for drinks and apps.  I enjoyed it and really wanted to return for a more substantial meal.   Last night I had my chance.

What was good about my experience last night was our party of four was seated right away.  I was worried we'd have a long wait since it was a Friday night and they don't take reservations.  Luckily for us, it worked out.

Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with the food.  It's not that anything was bad; I was just underwhelmed.  I shared the carpaccio and the fritto misto to start.  I regret not having ordered the grilled calamari instead.  I had a linguine with clams as my main and though the pasta was cooked perfectly, I found the dish forgettable.  

The other reason Gio's fell short of my expectations is the service was spotty.  The two servers we had were both pleasant but not nearly attentive enough.

Although I'm not in love, I think I will go back and give Gio's another try.  For sure, I will choose a less busy night and order more carefully!",2012-02-04 15:17:00

The service was ok, got a table in a reasonable amount of time as well as drinks. 

The rotunda burger was disappointing. Definitely more girth than taste. The burger was dried out, the cheese melted on it more by accident, like somebody dropped it on the asphalt, scooped up the asphalt underneath it, and stuck it between two enormous buns.

VEl0a9yjnkZNQlr_nu4vjg,7Nq-eNN9v2-7PDQNLbg3Zw,wVc3g-YfyDvkOLDecpr4DA,4,2,0,0,"Came here for winterlicious and tried their $25 fixed dinner menu. It's always a hit or miss with Winterlicious whether it be the menu items or the portion sizes. I went throught the long list of participating restaurants and finally decided to try this place based on their reviews.  And I can gladly say that I made the right decision! 
The restaurant is located on yonge so needless to say parking was a bit difficult to find. I came here at around 5 pm which is extremely early for dinner but had no choice since they were booked until after 9:30.  I'm not sure how busy they are on days outside of Winterlicious but I came on a Saturday night and surprisingly the place was packed by 6. 
The atmosphere of the restaurant was very relaxed and casual with antique elements which added a touch of elegance. The slanted lamp fixtures on the ceiling was probably the first thing that caught my eye along with the collage of magazine pages on each table as design. 
We were a party of three so we made sure to order different items. 

Appetizers:
- Roasted Beet Salad with Scallion Dressing and Toasted Pumpkin Seeds
- Baked Goats Cheese with Polenta, Sundried Tomato Paste and Pesto
- Crispy Pork Belly with Butternut Squash Mash, Carmelized Apples
My favourite was the pork belly, it was very tender and flavourful. And the sweet butternut squash mash went well with the pork belly. I'm not a big fan of goat cheese but ordered it anyways since the waiter recommended it. It was definitely very unique and quite rich. The mixed greens was a nice  compliment to even out the strong flavours from the goat cheese. I would recommend to those who like goat cheese but sadly I'm still not a fan. The beet salad was average but quite refreshing. And just to add we ordered bread to start with which was $1 per person. The bread was okay not too special so probably wouldn't order it again so I have more room for my meal. 

Mains:
- Pork Tenderloin with Maple Balsamic Glaze, Soft Polenta, Sweet Peas and Onions
- Braised Boneless Beef Short Ribs with Navy Beans and Root Vegetables
- Pumpkin Seed Crusted Salmon with Mango and Smoked Red Pepper Salad
My favourite, hands down, would have to be the salmon. It was perfectly seasoned and the texture/flakiness was just right. The roasted pumpkin seeds on top added a nice crunch and the mango salad just added another dimension to the dish. The mangos were ripe which always makes me happy and I loved the flavours of the smoked peppers. The presentation alone was impressive with the salmon served on a bed of bright colours from the greens and the mango salad. 
My second favourite would be the beef short ribs which was cooked thoroughly but not to the point where it becomes hard to chew. Personally I don't like my beef rare or anywhere close to that so I was quite happy not seeing a lot of pink. The vegetables were nicely cooked. Only thing lacking would be the presentation but it tastes great so not complaining too much. 
The pork tenderloin was not as tender as I would've liked it to be but I rather enjoyed the puréed polenta and sweet peas which I thought complimented the pork quite nicely.

Dessert:
- Flourless Chocolate Cake
- Creme Brûlée 
- Banana Chocolate Chip Bread
I liked the banana bread, it wasn't too sweet but I wouldn't say it's the best I've had. The chocolate cake was rich without being overpoweringly sweet and the blueberries on top was a nice touch. The Creme brûlée was served cold which I wasn't used to since I usually enjoy them warm. But the desserts  definitely helped to complete this very satisfying meal. 

Overall I had a lovely experience here and was glad I came across this place (thanks Winterlicious!). The waiter that served us was also very friendly and I was satisfied with the speed of service, allowing some time in between to digest. The portions are also reasonable and you will definitely leave feeling comfortably full. I will come back for sure to try their regular menu items!",2016-02-13 08:19:58

Last time I tried the place out, maybe a couple month ago.... I took my boyfriend there because we're both fans of speakeasyish bars. We went to The Roger Room in LA and were amazed so according to the reviews on Yelp, The Lady Silvia had potential! We loved that it's a hidden gem and the ambience is on point-- parlor furniture, bookshelves filled with all kinds of vintage and torn books, old movies playing, graffiti art on the ceiling, overall very tasteful decor!

First experience: It was a random Wednesday night, I had just gotten off work so it was like 1030ish. It wasn't busy at all.... I can't cut them any slack there haha. I'm in the service industry so I'm all about EXPERIENCE. Shortly after we sat down, cocktail waitress greeted us and just simply asked what we'd like. Not even a ""hello, how are you, have you been here before"" just a ""do you know what you're having?"" Ummmm no, we just sat down and haven't even looked at your menu... Sorry we're taking in the ambience? We were impressed until that very moment. Ruined it all. So we looked at the menu and made our decisions.... Maybe 15 minutes passed and she never came back. She was just gazing at her phone at the POS computer. We just got up and left, didn't even try a cocktail =\ and as we got up, she didn't even turn her pretty little head to notice or wish us a good night. FAIL! We went to the Velveteen Rabbit instead and were quite pleased. 

Last night: Brought a girlfriend who had wanted to check it out for a while now and a girlfriend visiting from AZ... I put the past experience behind me and decided to give them another shot because I really want to like the spot! Plus, I knew they'd appreciate the trendy speakeasy idea of the bar. We sat down in the lounge, browsed at the menu,  made up our minds on drinks and just waited to be served haha. Shocker. A gentlemen noticed we hadn't been helped and sent a waitress over-- wish HE could've taken care of us! She came over and just starred at us.... ""Hi, sorry about the wait, what can I get started for you"" is that so hard to spit out? It's beyond me. So we ordered. She brought back my friends' drink but she let me know they were out of the earl grey tea to make myyy drink. Okay, strike II.... But shouldn't you know what you're 86'd so when a guest orders that you can let them know right then and there so you can suggest something else? Ugh it was just another setback to add to their list!! And finally, she of course never came back to check on us. Another round? Waters? Ladies alright? Nada. I had to ask the same guy who first noticed us for the check. Strike III and we're out. She obviously didn't want a tip, so I just left 10%.... Which was more than she deserved! I hate tipping 10% because I hate receiving 10%!!!!!! But I also cannot stand servers who think they should receive at least 20% when they don't even work for it. My receipt says my server's name: Jaime.... I wouldn't know because she didn't introduce herself. 

We went to Velveteen Rabbit after this horrible Lady Silvia experience.... Again. Maybe they should hire PERSONABLE people who care to make their guests' experience! It's not my fault you may not like your job or working period, but don't ruin it for other people though. It really isn't that hard. 

I can't say I'd recommend this place. If anything, I'd tell people NOT to bother. I hope they get their shit together soon because it has potential, just needs LOTS of attention on details that go a long way. 

1 star for the secret spot, nailed the speakeasy part. 2 stars for the ambience. I think I gave those generously too =[",2013-10-05 19:36:26

Custard was good, but Rita's is better. Freddy's is more ice cream consistency and the flavor was refreshing though. It is piped down a long chute and is then scooped versus a softer serve style like they have at Rita's. The sundaes are pretty creative. Kids had the dirt and worms, brownie sundae, and their signature Turtle sundae. For me, I prefer to start out plain because if you can't get the basic, it doesn't matter what toppings you put on it. So, plain-Jane custard cone for me. All were tasty but again, more ice creamy than custardy. 

Fast service though considering how packed they were and the drive thru seemed to hustle through pretty well as well...way better than at Culvers. 

Looks like we've got a winner! I'll be back to try the burgers and will update my review from there. But, a good solid start and a welcome variety to Surprise.",2013-02-23 15:40:17

While gimmicky, I can see how this can be appealing for some. Personally, I didn't know they offered they offered this when I came in as an after-dinner drink in the same plaza in which this was located. 

I had an order of Mango Mousse which came out to about $8 after taxes. While expensive, it is definitely something I would consider ordering again. The salty cheese topping that came with the drink complimented really well with the sweet light creamy flavour of the actual drink. I was especially impressed that the drink did not taste like liquid sugar; there was a distinct flavour of tea which I appreciated given the offerings of other local establishments. 

The cup that came with the drink was also a highlight. The cups are very well-designed. They feel durable and have a look of higher-quality plastic, giving you a impression that 'royal' treatment you'd expect from bubble tea standards. The lid of the cup gives you several options: dumping a straw through the hole with the perforations, removing a small cap to reveal a sip hole (WITH another hole to store the cap while the sip is in use). 

While the service is nothing to write home about, as it was relatively standard, I thought the electronic pucks that alerts you when your drink is ready is quite a neat idea. The idea that I don't have to stand awkwardly near the cash or have to idle around to listen for my order is rather convenient. You can seat yourself in the ample amount of seating provided speaking while taking in the quaint cottage-look of the establishment. 

Overall while the drink was definitely a bit more pricey than your usual fare, I felt like I got actual value for my money. Unless you are in a rush to get somewhere, it is clear that Royaltea has it's money in the right place in terms of creating an atmosphere for folks to wind down, have a drink and enjoy a relaxing conversation.",2018-01-10 13:24:29

We were the largest group there but the service was constantly great throughout the time I was there. As soon as we got our plates we were served gnocchi very frequently, so our plates were never empty. My friend and I only got to about 4-5 servings until we were stuffed. 

I remembered gnocchi tasting really yummy when I had some last summer at my friend's cottage. However, I thought the gnocchi's here were a bit starchy and sticky when I popped them into my mouth.

The interior of the restaurant is nice and has chairs made out of clothes! I was so amazed by the chairs and kept asking people if they were really made of clothes.

Luckily, noticed Gogo on Yelp and saw it was conveniently located right across the street at Fashion Show mall. Went up to the 3rd floor thinking it would be in the food court but it is actually on the first floor at K1850 near Macy's Men. 

First thing I noticed was the very friendly staff that greeted me. I will say that their fish didn't look as fresh as I typically would like to see and it didn't really feel chilled like I prefer it. Overall it was good, not great. 

I did find the vegetables to be more fresh looking and tasting. They had good sauces as well. 

Another thing is that I think it's a little more pricey than most Poke places. I got the large (3 scoops) plus 1 extra scoop ($1.99) and my total was around $16.50. 

I would definitely go back and probably will tomorrow because I know I can get a tasty meal that is macronutrient friendly for me.

I came here after having a horrid experience with the pharmacist at CVS on Sunset and Whitney Ranch (Her name is Farah, seriously, she's going to kill someone). Lis took the time to explain all the prescriptions I had received over there and was really nice about it so I started coming to this pharmacy. 

They are always pleasant. They always greet you as soon as you get to the counter, Yes, they are busy. ALL the pharmacies are busy, name one that isn't. But they never have a problem looking up medications for me that my insurance takes that also won't interact with other medicines. They have helped me with an online discount program when I wanted a medication that my insurance didn't cover. They always take the time to explain new medications that I get, side effects etc. Even when they are busy. And they do it in a nice way, not a ''OKAY NEXT'' kind of way. I really appreciate this, because I know they are wicked busy. 

Like I said before Lis is wonderful. The male pharmacist (tall guy), wish I knew his name, is fantastic. And there's also a counter girl, young with long black hair (I know, I need to learn their names) who is incredibly friendly and upbeat. 

I wouldn't recommend the drive-thru for your prescriptions. Even if you are behind one car it's a long wait, for whatever reason. But when I go in I rarely wait more than a few minutes for someone to get to me. 

They do automatic refills (nice), and give courtesy calls when your prescription is ready. Overall I'd have to say I'm very happy with this pharmacist, and the employees who work there.",2015-05-26 22:14:16

It's several thousand miles north of where it should be (D.F.), but it's absolutely delicious Mexican fare. However, what's not fare is, I heard it has closed down :(

Excellent taco, a little different from what I am used to, but delicious nonetheless, makes me long for my homeland, El Mexico! Oh wait. I have never even been there. And am not Mexican. But hey! Who's counting! 

I'll have to try it again when I go back to Pitt, but please, PA, keep this place open... we are starved of authentic Mexican food in these parts and it is your duty as good citizens. 5/5

Dustin, five years ago, said this, and it bears repeating, so I will copy and paste from the review below me:

""You know, with the recent rash of wannabe Mexican restuarants out there (i.e. Qudoba, Baja Fresh, and the rest of the horrid pack...yes Taco Bell, this means you), it's great to walk into a place that feels truly authentic. A place where 3 generations of people from, you guessed it, Mexico(!) working to keep this place running. There is something warm and fuzzy about everyone screaming at each other in Spanish.""

This location hasn't officially kicked off their grand opening yet but they were offering a 10% discount to customers during their soft opening. (Essentially you just dont have to pay tax on the drink). 

I tried a new drink which I normally wouldn't get which was the Dark Knight. When I received it I didn't expect the color to be so dark, I guess thats why they named it Dark Knight for a reason. It was almost the same color as you would drink Coke. The taste was pretty gross, the only thing the barista told me was the tea was more sweet than herbally so it was hard to figure out whether it would taste good or not. First couple of sips it was too sweet and I had asked for slight sugar too =/...  Other than that it had a very syrupy texture and tasted a bit like medicine... I didn't even bother finished it and just dumped it as it was pretty horrible tasting.

Despite a rather crappy location being behind the rest of a shopping center and visible from the street after driving past, people who are in the know and support such an historic piece of SoCal culture will keep this burger joint open hopefully for years to come.  It is a little strange driving under a low lying and quite large billboard when going through the drive-thru.  And it is equally strange being in a long and narrow drive-thru along side a flood channel.  But the product within this strange complex is what I know and love as the Original Tommy's.  

I usally get the same order when I go.  I get a double cheese burger with everything.  That is a burger with two meat patties, cheese, rib sticking chili, a thick slice of tomato, diced onion, pickles and mustard.  Add some regular fries to scoop the chili drippings off the paper and you are set.

Some times I switch up my order a bit and get a chili tamale.  This is a tamale with chili and all the other fixin's from the burger.  It is almost every bit as good.  Worth a try.

The location has a bit to be desired, located in a small strip mall with very little parking. The ambiance, also, is lacking. Usually when you imagine going to get a facial and wax you think of serene music, a tinkling water fountain perhaps, and some refreshments -- definitely water as getting a facial can leave you dehydrated, and you need to hydrate anyway, as has always been recommended to me at other places around town.

Things are a bit different here -- bright fluorescent lights, bleak white walls, and little to no décor. It's not really an ""all-frills"" type place.

However, on the good side - I paid $8 to have my brows done, which is great and as long as they don't make my brows look razor 90s thin I am good. They accomplished this. I was pretty weirded out by the blaring boom box that was playing oldies music though... which I thought they may turn off during my facial, no such luck.

I received a microdermabrasion facial, which I had actually never had before. So it's a little different from your normal facial, but the woman giving me the facial was extremely detailed about everything she was doing, which I did appreciate greatly. 

Overall, I would return for an eyebrow wax, but I'll probably keep searching for a different place to get my next facial.",2015-10-09 20:55:13

Chef Kenny works pure magic. I wouldn't doubt that he is one of the big influencers in the Las Vegas vegan culinary world's sudden expansion. From what I've heard, he supplies a few other vegan restaurants in the area with a lot of their food.

I tried the crunch roll, the rainbow roll, the dragon roll, the California roll, and the spicy vegan crispy beef. A note on the spicy vegan crispy beef: if you're ordering it online as I did, it already comes with a side of brown rice. So if you're sitting there for 20 minutes wondering where the rice sides are, like I did, you now be rest assured that they already come with the meal.

The texture of just about everything is spot-on and scrumptious. The only thing I've ordered there yet that I didn't care for was the California roll. It may have been a fluke, but it didn't remind me of a California roll at all. It was a mehh sushi roll compared to the other exquisite rolls we had ordered.

Now, that spicy vegan crispy beef I bought at a separate time through a recommendation from a friend. It was heavenly. It truly has its own distinct, nutty but tangy taste. And the texture, again, was fantastic. The coupled brown rice was also superb.

The ambiance has been noted in other reviews - it looks like a fast food restaurant with plastic booths and order at the counter - and the prices mostly match that. (Which is nice.)

The first thing we ordered was chai, which was not masala chai but a chai made with saffron and a lot of milk. Masala chai would have been better, and we won't order their version again. 

The dal fry (a thick creamy dal stew) was pretty tasty and moderately spicy and I would order this again. The baingan bharta, however, was nothing like the smoky eggplant curries I've had at other restaurants. It was essentially a tomato-heavy marinara sauce with eggplant and felt out of place with the rest of the fare.

Madison admittedly does not have the best Indian food compared to other, larger cities. There is, however, much better Indian food and selection at Maharajah's, Maharani, or Swagat.

We made a 7:15 reservation for 4 for a Saturday night.  By the time we left the place was hopping and crazy busy.

We started with a little salumi and Cowgirl Creamery Inverness (oh how I miss the bay and Cowgirl whenever I wanted!) as well as oysters for the ladies.  The jam with the cheese was delish and the mustard with the meat had a great kick to it.  They are not shy with the spice here!  And the oysters were meaty and divine.  I wanted more.. so many more.

Around the table we shared a bottle of the Chablis Chardonnay, which was crisp and refreshing, just what you need on a summer night in Phoenix.

Mains ordered were, short rib stew, salmon, jambalaya, and the bbq ribs.  All were enjoyed immensely.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, the stew was spicy and filling, the jambalaya had a growing heat to it (which my friend enjoyed, it just slowed him down), and the ribs disappeared so quickly I'm not sure my husband actually ate dinner. :P  The cole slaw that came with the ribs was yummy, as that's the only bit I got to try.

For dessert we ordered the blueberry cheesecake and the hot chocolate cake.  The desserts are served in little mason jars which makes the portion just right to share so you can get that taste of sweet.  The cheesecake with the graham cracker streusel with almonds was yummy.  And the hot chocolate cake's cream on top was very good and the cake was nice and moist.

We stayed and played some chess, ended up being there until closing and Mikey simply came out to let us know we were welcome to stay as long as we liked, he merely had to lock the outside gate, which led to a hilarious conversation about old school tv shows including Legends of the Hidden Temple.

Hey Michael!

Hey Tony, can I get some ICE CREAM?

If you know anything about Gastonia, you've probably heard of Tony's. It is an institution in Gastonia. It has survived floods, plagues, recessions and earthquakes, because when you make a solid, great tasting product, people will buy it no matter what. Okay, maybe I've exaggerated a little bit, but not about their ice cream. People travel miles for this stuff and fill coolers/ice chests to take home. Now that's product loyalty.

The building is right off the main drag, old 74 with plenty of parking. Inside, the shop is pretty bare bones. There's always a steady flow of customers, but plenty of staff to help them. You may have to wait for a seat though.

My only gripe and it's a small one, is that I wish I could order a Root Beer Float or a Coke Float, Unfortunately, they do not carry Root Beer and they only have Pepsi products. Pepsi floats just aren't the same. Cheerwine Floats are popular but I'm a purist and less adventurous when it comes to ice cream. The milkshakes are my favorite product - enormous and delicious!

The station itself doesn't seem that different from many of the other older and not so new looking stations out there... you know which ones they are.  Dufferin even has new tile.  Christie still looks the same as does Bathurst or Lansdowne.  

Ossington's buses have a depot here though unlike Dufferin where you must fend for yourself for a space on the sidewalk along with the other riders.  It's a station so there's no sneaking on the back door so to speak.  The bus runs into this station from Ossington Ave (the 63).  

The 63 runs out of the station down Ossington to Queen and then Shaw and south to King to go east and then south of Strachan.  It runs though Liberty Village along Liberty to Atlantic before looping back up Shaw and up Ossington again.  It will stop at Ossington station and head north to St. Clair.  The 63A continues along Oakwood ave to Eglinton and goes to Eglinton West station on line 1.

The 94A (Wellesley) runs south on Ossington to Harbord and then east on Harbord though U of T running down Queens park and east along Wellesley to Wellesley station passing Yonge and continues to Parliament where it then heads north up to Bloor and Castle Frank station.

There are so many Asian Veg places where we're from that when in Vegas, it's probably the last cuisine that I'm looking to eat.

While we have a ""house of veggies"" (two, I believe) in The Bay Area, it's nothing like what they have here in Vegas. Bay Area Vegetarian House = Mostly Vietnamese style food, served with a side of Supreme Master aura. LV Veggie House = Mostly Chinese inspired dishes, served with a Buddhist aura in a tranquil environment, just a short drive from the bustling activity of The Strip.

They really thought out every nook and cranny of the details to their interior decorations. It's nothing fancy, some of it kinda cheesy, yet it all flows together so naturally. I got a kick out of listening to the water fall from the top of the corrugated plastic roof of one of the gazebos.

The waitresses were great. One gal even rearranged our table in a fit of feng shui (or OCD). It's good that they're easy to talk to since the menu descriptions were quite vague or nonexistent at all.

I'm a fan of the Genreral Tso, so that is one of the first things we ordered. Theirs was done as well as any that I've had. Same with the Orange Chicknon. Crispy with a nice tangy sauce. The General coulda been spicier but that's what the house made chili sauce is for.

The dish that truly stood out for me was the Pan Fried Noodle. My coworkers often order this when we go out to eat at non-veg restaurants. After one bite, I can see why. The noodles were crunchy, while the flavorful, thick sauce moistened things up and added an extra layer of flavor.

They have a Curry Roti that was delicious as well. It reminds me of the light, flaky roti that I used to love before I returned to being Vegan. Get two orders of this or you'll be fighting over who gets the last bite.

Even though we were stuffed, my babygirl was drooling over the dessert menu. We went with the fried 'naner and ice cream. So good! They had several ice cream flavors but they were out of most of them so we went with classic vanilla.

You can tell that Chef Kenny puts a lot of love into his food. He'll come out to greet the dinner guests and chat for a bit before disappearing into the kitchen. He just wants to be sure everyone is enjoying the food.

I could spend my entire Vegas vacation in Chinatown. Partly because of Veggie House. They make being Vegan in Vegas a breeze. They do have egg in some items, but if you tell the waitresses that you're Vegan, you'll have no worries.

The service is top notch, quick, unobtrusive and suits the atmosphere of this restaurant. Our fabulous waitress didn't make a misstep. I was here for my birthday and they just found out when we walked in, at the end of dinner the whole staff had signed a birthday card for me! What a thoughtful touch.

The food is incredible. The courses are fresh and original, definitely unique and cutting edge. This is statement food. Every taste was defined and fresh. There wasn't a sloppy dish to be had. It was beautifully presented and some of the freshest I've ever had. 

And I have NO idea what people are talking about when they say 'strip mall.' Have you even been to some of the stores or restaurants around there? Definitely high end. I get my hair done in this 'strip mall' and it's by far one of the best salons around. I was seriously looking for a strip mall and instead walked into a beautifully lit corridor that opened up to several beautiful restaurants that led straight here. We walked in and the ambiance and the decor was incredibly high end. Must be that affected Scottsdale attitude coming out (live in NYC/DC/Beverly Hills and then stick your nose in the air, please). 

This place is beautiful, the food is like nothing I've tasted here yet and I can't wait to go back. I am addicted!",2014-09-26 05:02:27

The staff at this location are always extremely friendly even if the line is out the door. I do suggest you get here before 11:30am or after 1:00pm to avoid the crowds. I always get the turkey and provolone on wheat Mike's way (without tomatoes).  They slice their meats fresh and they are generous with the toppings, but sometime add too much oil...so keep that in mind. 
I think Jersey Mike's has become my favorite fast sub sandwich chain. They may be a bit more pricey but they beat the snot out of Subway and Jimmy Johns when it comes to service and taste.

Had some friends over for game 7 of the NBA finals and had been wanting to try out this place. So we called in an order and brought it back. We ordered the Mediterranean, the Farmvil and a plain cheese pizza. We weren't given a crust option so thin is what we got, paper thin.

The ingredients were all really good quality. But the sauce didn't really stand out, and to me, that's the most crucial ingredient.

There's really nothing else in the immediate area to compete with Naked Pizza, business-wise, but I don't really think this place will be a huge success. I'll probably give it another go sometime down the line, but a couple nights ago I opted to drive a little bit out of the way for a better pie, and better value.

It needed an alignment and there is a shimmy and bouncing from the tires that they stated they would fix. Also,  after our purchase were told the SD card for the vehicle is in the managers desk and he went home for the day. We are unable to utilize any services from the vehicle without the SD card. I  called the following day and was told they were going to pull one from another vehicle, I never heard back and had to call and inquire again about the SD card and am now told they ordered it.  I also spoke with Blue link and tried to at least get that activated and they told me it would have to be manually reset by the dealer since it is still listed under the previous owner. We made an appointment for the car that we had to wait over a week for (far past the 3 day return policy). My husband arrived at 8:30 for a 9am appointment and proceeded to sit there until 2:30pm when they finally said it was ready. Then when my husband asked about the status of the SD card he is told that they have to check with the auction lot and if they don't have it they will have to order one to be shipped overnight, then he asks if they reset the blue link and is told they will just do it when they get the SD card. My husband drives the car home and waits for me. I actually know quite a bit about cars and immediately notice that the alignment is still off and there is still a shimmy and bounce in the tires. We call back today and now have to wait almost another full week to take it in again and when asked today about the order status of our SD card are told that we have to wait until they can talk to the auction lot. This place is chaos! Absolutely no communication or organization and gives the customer the run around. I would not have purchased a vehicle from them at all had I known they would use unethical practices.

But if you're looking for something to do on a Friday night, love random flights, sports and beers--this is right up your alley! 

I agree with all the super-fun things everyone else mentioned, but I do want to clarify some things as I think there may have been some changes recently. 

We came here with my boyfriend's 8 year old and although he had a ton of fun, I didn't think this event was as family friendly as everyone else did, and here's why: 

1) Actually reasons 1-3 are the Lake Erie Monsters girls. 

Seriously? Did they dress these girls with leftovers from Christie's? I swear to GOD this isn't just me being uptight. It's borderline impossible to offend me--but when an 8 year old is watching a strip show (on cold ice, no less) next to you-- I don't quite think it's appropriate. Now, again, before you jump down my throat for ""exaggerating"", please note that my bf's son was so embarrassed, laughed the whole time and asked, ""Why is their hair making so much commotion?"" He was referring to the only dance-move they seemed to know, where they're bent over, swinging their hair in circles... continuously. While I'm sure this has it's entertainment value, it's not really something I find appropriate for young boys or girls, for that matter! 

4) We all love a great fight--but it's slightly hilarious to see 6 and 7 year olds cheering on brutal punches with signs saying, ""Fight, Fight Fight!"" A girl and her father were punching the glass while a fight was happening right in front of them--so much so that the ref had to yell at them. Great example! I know, I know... that's what hockey is about. But there's more to the sport, right?! I just find it strange that we're teaching our children to rally behind random violence, etc. etc. etc. 

I also don't want to make it seem like this was a negative experience (see those 5-stars?) It was a blast--I just felt like I shaved off some of Kelton's childhood by bringing him there. You know, kind of like that feeling after you let your kid watch a horror film you remembered being much less gruesome, but it's too late now--that kind of thing. 

In the future, I think I'd keep this as an adult activity or something we do with Kelton when he's over the age of 15. (God--I feel like the most uptight person ever now...)",2013-12-10 18:36:36

Lunch service is only available on weekends. Otherwise it's strictly dinner service throughout the week.  Interior has been renovated with the removal of several tables in lieu of a full service bar. Seating indoors is limited, which is fine in summer with the outdoor patio, but not sure what they'll do in the winter months. The parking lot has pretty much been taken up with their meat smokers so you'll have to use the limited spaces on Cherry St. 

There is a distinct feeling that the whole operation has been streamlined to maximize profit and minimize loss. Very much like a takeout or food truck you order and pay for your food at the counter, likewise with the bar should you also require refreshment. Note they do not serve coffee or tea - only 'bar' service.  You pick a table to sit and your order is brought out to you. Food is served on an aluminum tray with paper plates and plastic cutlery.

Ok the food. I had the brisket with a side of broccoli quinoa salad. It arrived with two slices of generic white bread, some garnishes of sliced onion, pickles and hot pepper.  There was no butter or margarine for the bread. The brisket was very good with the right amount of saltiness and fat. The outside was blackened and crispy. Broccoli quinoa salad was also excellent. 

In the past few months there has been an explosion of bbq joints opening up in the GTA.  The food at the new Cherry is good.

What this means is that this is not the place to go if you are in a rush. If you dont mind waiting 20+ minutes, the dumplings and other items arw quite good. My issue here has been that the waiters dont all speak English well, or at all. Their main menu has English translations, but  special items on the mini menus on the side of the tables are only in Chinese. This combined with the said English challenged waiters has ended badly twice when wiered dishes were ordered due to miscommunications (fried chicken cartilage, and fried chicken feet) .

It is decorated to look like a Hong Kong Dai Pai Dong (open-air food stall), of which genre this restaurant belongs to. Over the years the wall murals and decor started looking more dirty than stylish, luckily food quality is maintained more or less. 

The bilingual menu is uninspiring - typical Cantonese dishes and congee/rice noodle/noodle/rice categories, with odd and ""funny"" English translation. But don't let that discourage you, ask the waiter to explain what's on the Chinese-only menu or ask for his recommendation, or simply look around at other tables and point. If you like seafood, check out what's in live tanks as they usually have a good selection of fish and shellfish. 

Some of the dishes I've tried:
+ stir fried Vancouver crabs in curry sauce (HK version curry i.e. mild) 
+ stir fried clam (or whatever shellfish) in black bean sauce 
+ Tong choy (Thai morning glory) in fermented bean sauce or shrimp-paste sauce 
+ Teow Chew style omelet with chopped up fresh oyster (English translation says ""Fried Oyster Cakes"", I wouldn't know) 
+ Jellyfish appetizer if you like Jellyfish (English menu says ""Preserved Sea Weeds"") 

The food deserves 3.5 stars; for being there at any oddly hours, I am bumping up to 4 stars.

Oh, don't go there if you are looking for spring roll, chicken balls, egg foo yong type of Chinese food.  You'd be disappointed there.

It was my birthday and we made a reso for 8ppl, but only 4 of us showed up. The restaurant was pretty empty and they still made us wait at the bar. We ordered drinks and about 10 minutes later they showed us to a table in the corner next to another 4 top. The night only got worse. We pondered the AYCE promotion only to find out that the price advertised is only for Hard Rock player card holders, so our price would be $23.99, not $19.99. It didn't seem worth it, because the menu seemed smaller than when we last came and everything averages to about $7. Needless to say they told us the rules, but left out: we would only get two plates on the table for 4 ppl at once, nothing new would be brought until the plates were cleaned and once the plates are cleaned they will bring our other tapas, which were spaced 10 minutes apart. We ordered about 3 tapas each and the portions seemed to have gotten smaller. I mean 4-5 tater tots on a plate. The Sashimi tapa w. four thin slices of raw fish took about 15 minutes! The table next to us had about 3 plates on the table and kept getting more. I was seething in my chair at the silliness of it all. My friend told the server the scenario and she blamed the kitchen of all people.   I ordered the check immediately and she brought it out, but never showed back up to process the charges. We had to go to the bartender to close out the check! I had no intention of leaving her a tip and left cash and told them to charge the balance to the room.

First, their billing is a little sketchy as with all Jim's. They marketed as $9.95 a month however you are paying upfront $40 fee to ""secure"" that price (way to sneak it in guys).  I'm mad at myself for not asking for this feature to be removed before signing my contract. I was just not thinking clearly in the moment. Secondly, I assumed they would charge my card immediately upon signing the contract. Instead, they immediately charged my card $10, then waited two weeks later to run the full month charges PLUS that silly price guarantee fee.  That caught me offguard and of course created an avalanche effect. Including $25 late fees.  Needless to say, this is why I hate giving anyone my personal credit card information. It is partly my fault for not getting clarity, however as a new client I would hope they would work with me and understand how this could be confusing.

The second time around was much better, but not spectacular.

Sugar Marmalade is one of the hidden gem in the Yonge & Finch area. They offer wide varieties of desserts and drinks with a reasonable prices. It's definite my go to dessert place.



Black Sesame Panna Cotta
You can say this is my all time favourite dessert. It contains many different textures; richness from the black sesame seed ice cream; crunchiness from the corn flakes; chewiness from the mochi; and smooth & creaminess from the panna cotta. All the ingredients work well with each other - the combination is just perfect. There's actually not much flavour from most of the ingredients. The main flavour that you can taste is the rich and nutty black sesame seed ice cream.

I can't wait to come back and try more of their desserts. The next item on my list is their Green Tea Parfait. Hopefullly, I'll be back soon =)

New Years Day 2014.  My uncle and I sat at the bar as we didn't feel like waiting for a table.  Our waiter promptly brought us our drinks after sitting (coffee).  After that, everything went downhill fast.

We both ordered the $14 MTO breakfast.  We waited 20 minutes for our breakfast.  Sitting next to the open air kitchen, we watched at least 6 party's seated after us receive their food before us.  Every single server there works with blinder's on, so don't expect refills on drinks and the like from anyone other than your server.  All servers there avoid eye contact and all of them walked past our empty coffee cups we intentionally placed at the edge of the bar.  It was almost laughable as servers prepared their drink trays next to our empty coffee cups.

I ordered my 3 eggs scrambled and received 2 eggs fried hard & 1 over-easy...all 3 over-cooked.  I brought this to our waiter's attention and told him that I'd eat them anyway (didn't want to wait an additional 20 minutes for scrambled eggs).  I asked for jelly for my 4 pieces of toast and was given just 1 plastic serving.  My uncle asked for jelly and received the good stuff in a small dish (we shared).  Their hashbrowns are mushy...don't understand how that's possible.

I eventually received coffee refills after throwing dirty looks at the young waitress who brags about also working at the Hard Rock steakhouse.

The manager came by towards the end of our meal and asked how everything was.  I looked him directly in the eyes and replied ""awful"".  He turned his back to me and walked away with no reply.

*Note to locals*  If your considering the MTO special for breakfast here, you'll fair much better at Wildfire with the ""Gambler's Special"" without paying 7x the price (seriously...the Gambler's Special is only $1.99, $2.99 with choice of meat).  The difference (besides the outrageously higher price) is the couple pieces of fruit on a toothpick.  Further, the food and service are much better at Wildfire.

Sitting directly across from the kitchen, we did get a good look at other dishes offered and they looked delicious (especially the wraps).  As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.",2014-01-01 22:51:12

The drive was pleasant as the weather this Fat Tuesday was pretty mild.  Unfortunately, I used the Yelp mobile location map for directions and it took me to completely the wrong place.  After winding up on a residential road where I was pretty sure there wasn't a bakery, I was able to find where I was supposed to be heading.  Although, even with google maps this place was a bit hard to find for someone who had never been there before!

Lineup mid-day wasn't too bad, I only wound up waiting for about 25 min. outside and they had music playing, coffee to purchase and a little heater to warm up next to.  A lady at the front door kept order by ushering the appropriate amount of people inside as soon as there was room to hold them.

A dozen paczkis for $10?  Even though there were only two of us that I was buying for, there was no way I could say no to that deal!  Traditional flavours, so I was really happy and got 3 each of the prune, poppyseed, rose petal and apricot.  Their cases were filled with paczkis for this day but I did see some cakes and breads sitting back there and I'll have to come out and try some of their other baked goods.

Lets just say that it was a miracle that those 12 paczkis made it back home to Cleveland without my digging into the box...the smells coming from my passenger seat were unbelievable!  Once at home, we immediately went for our favorites, prune was light and delicate, and the apricot was heavenly.  I can say that all of the flavours exceeded expectations and they are easily some of the best paczkis I have EVER had.  No wonder Kiedrowski's has a Paczki Ball every year and sells thousands of these on Fat Tuesday!  There will be no question in the future where I will be going to get paczkis....the drive out to Kiedrowski's is worth it  ;o)",2011-03-22 17:38:49

Next was the duck bao. It was COLD, tasteless and oily as hell. Someone must have decided that since my banh mi was too salty, that they should leave this one bland. Think I'm exaggerating on the oiliness? See the pic I uploaded. Pics don't lie!

I ordered the FM iced tea and an almond croissant. The tea was slightly different compared to how it would be regularly prepared as I needed it lactose free, so I'm not sure how it would have tasted otherwise. I was thoroughly pleased with the taste of the iced tea. It is exactly how I would want my iced tea. Coming from an Indian background, we drink our tea VERY strong. Like, stronger than coffee, strong. It was the same strength as what I'm used to drinking. The flavour of the tea was absolutely perfect. I forgot to ask for less sugar, as I usually find drinks extremely sweet, but even then it was sweetened perfectly. The almond croissant was delicious as well. I only wish it was toasted a bit so it could have that crispy outside while being warm and soft on the inside with the gooey almond filling.

I have stumbled into a few local coffee shops in Scottsdale and also a few chains (no shame people) Cartel definitely gives it's competitors a run for their money. 

When we walked in, the smell exactly what you'd hope if you love the smell of coffee. It smelt like ~Heaven~ and by heaven I mean roasted coffee beans. People were chatting, working or simply enjoying their beverage of choice (there's even beer and wine on tap!)--it was a very welcoming and relaxing vibe.

Ok so what did I order? My girlfriend said they make a great chai so I took her word for it but took it a step further...I ordered me a *dirty*chai (chai with a shot of espresso). and It was Perfect. If you love chai you know how important it is for it to not be too sweet and this had the perfect combo of spice, hint of espresso and creaminess!

klUEreKpxxPYloaPyzALoA,AKXqbuifvfvNEpr3Qs51hQ,2hEgXCEkljp3Ini17CHGxw,4,2,2,3,"I finally wandered into Red Hot Robot after another wandering session in Stinkweeds (adios, hard-earned cash, I'll miss you) and I'll tell you that I enjoyed walking and looking around this joint. Full of random toys, vinyl or otherwise (including these funky UglyDolls http://www.uglydolls.com/ , which may have 3 eyes or one), collectible figures - robot or otherwise (many with a Japanese design bent), books on graffiti (Bansky, etc.), t-shirts, hip and non-cheesy greeting cards, candy (including those chocolate Kinder Eggs with the BRAND NEW! 2008 collection of little toys that American kids would swallow but European kids apparently wouldn't), and more. 

Red Hot Robot could easily be located somewhere in San Francisco, where there definitely is a huge market of people who'd buy stuff like these collectibles and toys for themselves or other people; which makes the fact that it's here in uptown Phoenix instead all the greater. That's because I would never have expected Phoenix to have a store like this (but I'll be first to readily admit to underestimating this city now and then).  

The downside to Red Hot Robot for me personally is as much as I thought everything in there was pretty cool, I still didn't buy a single thing. However, that probably has more to do with my aversion to ""stuff"" in general than anything else. 

So 4 stars. Even though I didn't buy anything, I hope enough people do. Great little independent businesses like this one are what's going to keep rapidly developing-and-redeveloping Phoenix from becoming ""Anywhere, USA"".  Definitely worth checking out next time you're around this part of town.",2007-12-15 17:27:01

They offer up the usual healthy variety with juices, smoothies, salads, and then some. The Sweet Asian salad was delicious and clean, and I love the fact they put their detox on the greens. My boyfriend, on the other hand, got the Chicken Quinoa and the chicken looked dehydrated af. So either we went on an off day or its always that dry.

The acai bowls are amazing here. The base is delicious and the toppings complement it well. Plus, they blend it up with acai fruit (rather than just the juice) so it's packed with antioxidants. Definitely recommend the Earth Bowl plus almond butter topping. 

Downsides to this place is that it's pretty pricey (on par with other similar healthy joints) and the consistency is not quite there yet. One of out of three times, the acai bowl we got just wasn't the same. It wasn't as sweet which is probably hard to control based off the fruit without using sugar additives and there was huge chunks of frozen solid smoothie not blended in.

The regular rooms aren't terrible, but they're not much cheaper than the GO rooms and there is a BIG DIFFERENCE between the two rooms. We took to Twitter for a coupon code, and they gave us a code that let us upgrade for $20 each night.

The GO room is excellent. It has a big flat screen TV, great bed, a TV in the bathroom mirror, both a shower and tub, a nice lounge chair in front of the big window, a great closet and everything is pristine and clean. I can't express how much happier you'll be with a GO room. And for $65 a night during the week, you really can't beat it.

The location is great. It's across the street from the Bellagio (see the water show outside every half hour) and Caesars Palace. Behind it is this neat little Italian joint (not fancy, just fun) called Battistas that gives you free unlimited wine with your meal and a guy with an accordion who comes around playing to all the tables.

The outdoor area is huge, which I love. They have a lot of land here. The pool area is HUGE, they must have at least five pools. They also have a little area with real Flamingos (which were freezing their patooties off while we were here) and there's plenty of places to walk around and explore in a semi-quiet environment.

My only complaint is the lack of good food. The Burger Joint makes a decent greasy breakfast, but the rest of the food is crap. Sin City Brewing company is the biggest highlight only because they have a fire pit out back.

As for the Casino... it's OK. There's nothing spectacular about it except that there are dancing girls in one corner on a little stage every once in a while. The fifty year old boob-implanted waitresses are few and far between and I wasn't offered a drink even once despite the amount of time I spent in here one night.

I will plead the 5th on this; but if you are hiking with little or no one around and have a friendly, well-behaved dog, you might let your dog have some freedom.

for non-desert folks: BEWARE - the sandstone here is very rough/sharp and dogs can easily get cuts in their paw pads.  There are cacti everywhere and dogs get spines in their mouths, between their toes -- all over!! Bring a pair of tweezers!  If it's super hot out, look for some shade, but be careful b/c rattlesnakes like shade too! (A friend's dog almost sat on one recently.)

Generally eating cheap Italian food like this makes you feel kind of shitty in the end but that's something we always factored in as it's expected so that's fine - the food is reasonably tasty for the price.

Recently we ate there and suddenly my wife literally had to run to the bathroom to throw up. The food didn't taste off or anything and we thought maybe she ate too fast or maybe the food was too heavy as she ate very little in the morning. 

As we were leaving I went to the men's washroom and one of the sinks was full of vomit. I notified the management about this - when there are around 10 people in the restaurant and two cases of throwing up at the same time it's not an accident anymore. The management basically told us that it can't be their food, everything's done fresh etc. and added ""but thanks for telling us"". 

It was clear at this point that no responsibility is taken - or even admission that it could potentially be their food that's causing the problem. Of course it's possible that two customers out of 10 happen to throw up for some other reason within 30 minutes - but the chances are pretty close to zero.

I walked out and will not be back. I simply can't reward an establishment that flat out denies the possibility of their food being defective and offers no compensation (or even a partial refund..!) for a ruined day and the humiliation of throwing up in the public.

I knew Blue Nile was close to my work but I usually only get a 30 minute break and take-out didn't seem like the best idea given the pictures I saw of the platters served here.   It does say Take out is available so one of these days I just might try it.   The fact that I found the food absolutely delicious certainly helps in making me want to try it.   On another note, I may have also tried take out in the past but COULDNT FIND A MENU ANYWHERE.  No official website, no pictures on Yelp, none available on menuism.net or menusearch.com or tonsomenus.org or any of those terrible sites that never have working menus anyway.  That I didnt take a picture of it myself and upload it here is totally besides the point

I first started by trying some iced tea, which was brought out with a small jar of limes and a container of sugar which I thought was a nice touch.  My co-worker and I both ordered the Vegetarian platter and shortly after we ordered we were presented with the giant platter of various vegetable dishes all on top of a huge piece of injera.  The very nice woman who might or might not also be the owner also brought out a basket of the same bread.   I only know it's injera bread because of Yelp.  Thanks guys.  I grabbed a piece of the bread from the basket and scooped up some of the lentils which was the centerpiece of the platter.   Wow, it was so tasty.   The injera was spongey and very sourdough like as I expected from other reviews and I enjoyed it, but the star was the lentils.   This is going to sound like the most backhanded compliment ever, but they actually tasted like taco bell ground beef to me.  To me this is actually a good thing which is yet another embarrassing revelation I'm making on here.  Anyway, throughout the entire meal I couldn't get enough of the lentils and how much I thought they tasted like beef to me.   Veggies tasting like meat are about the best thing ever.  I enjoyed all of the other veggies too, from the green beans to the various purees, and much like I always do I loved mixing veggies together and trying different combos with each bite.

1.  As much as I liked the injera, after a while I found my palate getting a little tired of it.   It was also lukewarm to cold, and I assumed that was how it was supposed to be but I saw another reviewer mention it should be hot?   If this is true I would have much preferred some heat to it, but I'm not aware enough to make that call.
2.  They don't open until 1 pm.   I prefer an earlier lunch, so I found myself just counting the minutes from about 12:15 til 1 to go down there.  Personal thing, but I think it should count
3.  I really wanted to try some meat but the majority seemed to be cooked in some type of butter.   Again this could be traditional cooking and I still loved the vegetarian platter, but I was a little bummed about not being able to try both without worrying about my lactose intolerance (shakes fist to the heavens) and my choices were overall limited.

The marinara sauce was delicious to dip the fried zuchinni in. For the entree I got the Ragatoni Bolognese,  I swear it tasted just like the one I make at home. Full of flavor and I even added shrimp to it. Huge shrimp! My fiancé got him a pizza he enjoyed it and really loved the crust.

If you were to get the fish, I would definitely recommend to add extra vegetables, we added lotus roots, bean sprouts and noodles (noodles were amazing!!) and the vegetables just become so flavourful from the fish broth and spices. 

The chilli oil they used in the fuqifeipian was so flagrant and not too spicy and the beef was so thinly sliced, it was amazing.

I ended up getting the A.M. Superfood Bowl which consisted of coconut milk chia seed pudding, granola, berry compote, and more fruit on top. I had never had chia seed pudding before and it was so good!! I am usually an eggs person, but the coconut milk made it super tasty. The consistency was like a tapioca pudding. The combination of the crunchy granola, sweet berries, and creamy pudding made every bite a delight. It also came with almond butter toast on the side which was nice but really not necessary.

Pros
Menu has many options and fun variations. The BLT includes avocado and fried tomatoes. Yummy
We had some appetizers which were both delicious. Zucchini and fried pickles.  
The menu had so many fun choices and we wanted to try many of the options. 

Looks like they have an interesting whiskey menu-they had some unique options
The person who sat us was friendly and gave us the impression that service would be great even though he had no idea if they had Hudson Baby Bourbon and did not check 

Cons
We were told when we sat that Kristen or a similar name would be right over-well there was a girl in the bar watching all the other tables and she never came. Made direct eye contact with us repeatedly but never bothered to see if we needed service. We were in her area and clearly had nothing (no drinks, menus, etc. After 20 full minutes we were able to grab a waiter from another area and see if he could get us menus, drinks and take our order. He was very nice and said he would get us started and find ""Kristen"". Again she never arrived so we asked the guy if he could help us. He did and gave us great service. I would have told someone as I left but I couldn't even figure out who to tell. 

The food was good but I prefer to have some service as I can't take my own order into the kitchen. I did figure out the whiskeys once I got a menu. Service is a real issue here. The bartender seemed to be talking to a table of her own friends and that is why she was unable to serve us. Would have liked refills

Prices have increased throughout the years (I go here a lot) but it's still pretty worth for the amount of food you get. I'm not a big fan of pork bone soup but I did try the soup base and it was quite flavourful. From the lunch special I always get the pork katsu deal which includes a slice of katsu, rice, 2 fried dumplings, black bean noodles (can place this with cham pong (seafood noodle soup) with $2 charge, salad, and a choice of drink (miso or pop). There's about 5 options you can choose from and differs in price. Next to the lunch menu, I would only get soft tofu with dumplings in it as I'm not a fan of seafood and the rest of the soft tofu dishes were seafood. The soup is spicy. I love spicy so it's at a good level for me to enjoy. There's about 2-3 dumplings in it and a lot of veggies (kimchi and onions) mostly. It comes with a side of rice and I usually get purple rice.

It's easy to split the bills and accepts cash/debit/credit. 

Came here again for lunch and instead of getting the lunch special, I got the combo for one person. There's 6 options but I picked the one that came with black bean noodle and a side of dumplings.

A slightly more upscale and hip version of your standard neighborhood bar and grill. If you're considering a PT's type place, try this instead. It's all that, but up a few notches in terms of quality and style.

Off the beaten path, but worth going out of your way.

I like how a few basic menu items are made customizable - e.g. the burgers (beef, turkey, or veggie) with a choice of three preparations. (Check out the menu here for details!)

Similarly, there is one main pasta dish that you can mod out with a choice of meats and veggies.

The bacon-wrapped date app is scrumptious. 

The Avocado egg roll is basically a huge cream-cheese ""Rangoon"" - stuffed with spicy bliss and deep fried to perfection.

Oddly enough I was familiar with the space, but never put two and two together. It's the bird's nest, the unmistakable structure in the Crystals.

We were started with a huge bread basket. All of which was fresh and delicious. I also had the Strawberry Mule ($15), which was a refreshing twist on the moscow mule.

If I'm being honest, it was the Dungeness Crab Cocktail ($28) that swayed me to try Mastro's. It's my favorite crab and this was scrumptious. All the flavor, but without the fuss. It is served over dry ice so the presentation is rather striking.

With ""Ocean Room"" in the name I had to try the fish. I was tempted by the halibut on special, but I chose the Chilean Seabass ($49). It was a huge filet, that was moist and flaky. Surprisingly, their turf seems to be just as good as their surf, the husband had the Rack of Lamb ($49) and it was fantastic. I really like that the preparation is simple, just properly seasoned to allow the flavor of the meat to shine. We went for decadence when selecting our sides. I had to try the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi ($33) and the Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese ($14) piqued his interest. Both were rich, creamy and gooey. The crab in the gnocchi was too delicate for this dish it was overpowered by the creamy sauce and the bold truffle flavor. Both were mighty tasty, however.

We ate until we could eat no more, and there was a bunch leftover. Rarely do we have leftovers to box up, but it seemed like we hadn't even touched our sides. The portions are quite large and will satisfy the heartiest of appetites. We were much too full to attempt dessert. Their famous butter cake will have to wait.

The restaurant is small, but not cramped and has a very homey atmosphere. The wait staff is quite attentive and the service is always good.

I've only come across a few places in the whole country that make great biscuits and gravy and because I make it myself I've never understood why it's such a mystery for so many restaurants.

It's pretty delicious- the chicken wasn't dry, the sauce was good, and the salad was fresh with good dressing. The hot sauce was actually spicy, but not sour. I would say it's the best option of food that you can get in that specific plaza by Pan Am. 

Besides the price was reasonable. Tax included my meal was only $10.75. 

I would go back again and definitely tell people about this place.",2017-10-03 16:18:46

We had a waiter named Joey that was severely inattentive and didn't seem to be very organized in his work.

When we finally flagged him down to get it refilled he only refilled one then asked if anyone else needed more water and i had to point to my empty glass that had been sitting on the edge of the table for 22 minutes..

The Food:
The food USED to be good and portions USED to be perfect. Now the portions were much smaller and Im sure the food would have been good if Joey our waiter had brought it out when it was still hot...... Instead, we all got plates of barely warm food which ruined the  quality of it.

The downstairs dining room is fairly intimate.

I know I sound super old right now, but this is just not my scene. This is the perfect place to go with a group if you are celebrating something fun or heading out for the night. 

The wait staff all seem like they just drank a case of Red Bull each.....they were all over the place. Turns out they are all actually dancers/entertainers and don't have a lot of food service experience. They were all very nice though, if not a little scattered. They actually all do choreographed routines and dance around the restaurant. It's cool, but who's serving my food while this is happening? Kinda weird.

If you'd like to know about the vibe - there is a DJ with a dance floor, as well as a roof top deck. The menus are HUGE - something you'll have to see to believe.

The oysters came with a nice spinach and cheese topping, however, the oyster itself was quite small and was buried under the toppings.

Well, this food won't shut up--and I mean that in a good way. In fact, it pretty much cups you by the jaw and screams in your face: ""I AM DELICIOUS. CONSUME AS MUCH OF ME AS YOU CAN!"" I had the brisket and it was perfect. Perfect amount of fat. Perfect crust from the dry rub on the outside. Perfect texture. Both the sweet and hot sauces are winners on their own, but I like to go half and half to make a sweet heat concoction. Next time I might just try the dry rub, though. 

Their mac 'n cheese is very good, creamy with a little bit of gritty feel that I'm guessing comes from the fact that it's baked and has a little grated parm mixed in. The beans have some spice and an overall pleasing flavor. Cornbread was good, but honestly, it's pretty hard to screw up cornbread.

And, for dessert, a long john doughnut with maple frosting and...eek!...little morsels of bacon sitting nonchalantly on top. That speaks for itself.

We made the reservations ahead of time and the day before they called to say there was a race in front of the restaurant and we couldn't park out front. My 80-year old grandma was coming with us and she has trouble walking. The restaurant apologized but had no options for handicapped parking with the race going on. My dad parked in town and wheeled her in a wheelchair across the bridge. This worked out fine, but when we arrived at the restaurant they had us at a table upstairs. We asked them to show us to the elevator. They didn't have one. So after all the discussion the day before about handicapped parking why on earth would they seat us upstairs? We had to wait for a table to be set up downstairs. Luckily they were not busy.  We were seated near an outside door and had space for the wheelchair but by the time we were ready to leave they added a table outside in front of the door so we had quite a bit of trouble maneuvering the wheelchair to get out! 

We also had trouble with the food. My mom and sister don't eat gluten so they ordered a meal that had potatoes listed as the side dish. It came out of the kitchen with noodles instead of the potatoes. They said they changed the menu. But that should be explained by the waitstaff when someone orders the meal! We also waited over 15 minutes before someone even took our order.

I don't come here for gyoza or tonkatsu, but they do have these things and they're good. The star here is the ramen. I usually get some form of tonkotsu and it's flavorful, filling, hearty, and tasty. I like the toppings they have (bacon cheese ramen!) and the noodles are great.

I've been here a few times now, and I've never been disappointed! The menu is quite unique. It's divided into ""Firsts"", ""Seconds"", and ""Thirds"", which roughly translates to appetizers, small plates, and entrees. In the Firsts section, I've tried the Trios Mec Pomme. This was an interesting dish... the potato skins are smaller than bite size, so it was really difficult to eat it. Otherwise, the flavor was great! In the Seconds section, I've tried the crispy chicken wings confit, barrel aged tabassco fried chicken, and pork tonkatsu ramen. The crispy chicken wings are my favorite of the three. It was perfectly seasoned with salt, lime and garlic. I was not a big fan of the fried chicken. There was too much flour and too little chicken. Also not very crispy. The pork ramen is pretty good, but for the portion size, it's not really worth your money!  And for Thirds, I've had the Ohio lamb burger. SUPER delicious!!

7vdC89XgTOXs_vO4IKreFw,_uqIpl5tzucKuIlZZPBZRw,UT22ExffDZjB1tzBDwSWfA,3,2,0,0,"We've visited the Rusty Bucket twice so far.  The first time was in December for a date night.  The food was fantastic.  I debated between a sandwich or the mac and cheese made with beer cheese.  Then I found a burger (actually two!) that had beer cheese on top of them.  I went with the Green Chili burger, which actually has a beer cheese on it, along with spicy jalapenos.  It was delicious, as were the accompanying seasoned fries.  It was a Friday night, which was martini night, so I tried the grapefruity one that our server recommended that had fruit-infused vodka.  Yum at a great deal.  The only downside about that visit was that it was the first real cold spell of the season (like 20-something degrees out), and we were seated underneath a vent that every 10 minutes or so would blast freezing cold air on us.  We kept our jackets on the entire night, which you really shouldn't have to do.  Plus, it just cooled down our hot food.  Dear restaurants: turn off the A/C in the winter.  Thank you.

Our 2nd visit was a couple weeks ago.  My parents were in town visiting, so six of us went to the Rusty Bucket on a Saturday night.  When we arrived, we were informed it would be a 20-35 minute wait.  Ok.  That wasn't too bad, considering it was a Saturday night and the fact that they don't take reservations.  That 20-35 minute wait turned into a 60 minute wait.  Granted, it's not the restaurant's fault if people were watching sports on the big TVs around the restaurant and wouldn't leave their tables.  Well, maybe it partially is.  Around the 30-minute mark and beyond, we were told intermittently that our table would be ready very soon.  At around the 45 minute mark, they told us it would be just one more minute, and even had menus in hand.  I'm not sure what happened, but that dragged out until 60 minutes from the time we arrived, we were finally seated.  Everyone else who had been waiting for a table had long been seated, even parties bigger than us.  The manager told us that we'd be well taken care of and he'd buy us apps.  That was nice, of course, and the action that he should have done (although drinks may have been appropriate as well in this case).  Unfortunately, once we were finally seated, the follow up on those promises wasn't that great.  After our initial contact with our server who was all bright and bubbly, we rarely saw her again.  She never came by for drink refills, she never came by to check on our meals, and it took forever to get our check.  When we finally DID get the check, it had the price of the ""free"" apps on it!  Worse, the manager NEVER came by to check on us.  Seriously?  If I was the MOD on duty that night, I would have been kissing our asses to make sure we had a fantastic time.  I don't think a little attention after that fiasco is asking too much.  IT'S YOUR JOB.  I guess we were too nice and should have been total assholes instead.

Anyway, the food was good again and at least we weren't seated in the A/C zone on another brisk night, but the service and follow through was quite shitty.  Owning a dining establishment isn't just about the food and atmosphere, it's about providing quality customer service if you want repeat visitors.

Incredibly loud music managed to drown out any real conversation, and I am also assuming this is why the service wasn't that great - I don't think the waitress could hear us.

On top of the overly loud music, there were TV's playing sports everywhere, which really detracted from the atmosphere of the room.  Neat features like rocks in the middle of the room that added charm and a zen like calmness were overshadowed by the visions of football coming at you from every direction.

The food was good, and they had some sushi rolls that looked pretty interesting.  I went with the tepanyaki, which was quite tasty, and very filling and a good value for the price.

The service was interesting, long waits for drinks, and the food was brought out in no apparent order.  Appetizers appeared after full meals, and the easier items like lettuce wraps appeared a full 15 minutes after the tepanyaki box was put in front of me.

Started with an early 5:45 dinner at Oscars - Great view, the food was very nice & Bobby our server was on top of every request. Then we went on to the Scinta Show @ 7:30. 

The Scinta show is a 5 Star plus.  The Band is old school... Great Horns, Drums, Keyboard & Guitar. This is a real band!!! 

Frankie Scinta is beyond talented. He sings, dances, plays the piano magically, and charms the crowd. The show was 1 & 1/2 hours & it felt like 10 minutes. We laughed, we were touched, we remembered great entertainers... Too many to list! From Sinatra to Ray Charles to Michael Jackson & Bruno Mars... And the Bruno Mars was FABULOUS. 

Joey Scinta is a wonderful musician, singer, guitar  player & has a great way of engaging an audience... comically portraying Mick Jagger, Neil Diamond, & more.

A Beautiful young singer, Jenine Valentine can sing anything from classics to Opera. She wowed the crowd. 

After the show the Scintas invite the crowd up to Oscar's bar area to get to know them, take photos, enjoy some one on one time.  Frankie & Joey Scinta spent time with every table of patrons at the bar. Who does that?

Don't get me wrong I have had better BBQ, but for west coast and a chain this was pretty good. I could not give it five stars because for a BBQ place I have had better. But it was good none the less. One big issue for me was that they put jalapeños in their mac and cheese. I am not sure where that comes from but it needs to stop. I grew up on good southern mac and cheese and never ever have they put jalapeños in it.",2014-08-25 22:33:26

Baguettes are made perfectly fresh, with a soft middle and crunchy outside. The BBQ pork sandwich has wonderful Chinese BBQ sweet/smoky flavor in the thin cut pork. It goes so well with the pickled veggies in the sandwich. The cilantro and the jalepeños adds even more flavor! My taste senses have a party each time I eat one of these. I usually order a boba smoothie to go with my sandwich and their smoothies are consistently well made (no chunks of ice and very creamy). The boba has perfect texture and I can tell they just made it. Free Wi-Fi, clean restrooms and eating area, makes this place suitable for small gatherings.

Anyway, my GF and I were here recently and I was very impressed. The service was impeccably prompt...my drink came within a few minutes, and I had barely taken a few sips before the meal arrived. I know a lot of Yelpers seem to gravitate to the Duck Poutine Pizza and other meaty dishes, so as a Pescetarians I hope I can share some useful insight into Bannock's other offerings.

We ordered 1) Winter Sangria; 2) Blue Goose Rainbow Trout; 3) Bannock Bannock

The Winter Sangria was full of tart Cranberries and Apple slices...and alcohol! It was the perfect drink for a very snowy, slushy night, despite the fact that those two fruits wouldn't crack my top-fifty list of favourite fruits, and I don't even know fifty fruits. The beverage part though? A+++ definitely will drink again.

The Blue Goose Rainbow Trout arrived on a bed of green mustard-infused mashed potatoes and roasted leek. The fish was cooked splendidly, and the mustard potatoes were lovably lumpy and delicious. I'm going to try my hand at making some of my own tonight.

The trout was a fitting foil dish to the carb-filled Bannock Bannock. As a Canadian, Jew, and breakfast enthusiast, I was super into this dish: Smoked Salmon, Capers, Cream Cheese, and Dill. Yum! The Bannock bread is also inspiring enough to make me want to try cooking it at home too.

Very discrete sign, tinted windows, small entrance.  I must have came here around 1pm on a Saturday morning, and for the state at the time, this place was too nice.  Very clean, contemporary décor with smartly dressed service staff.  
I was with these two ladies that I met only a week ago, and this was our first time partying together.  I struggled to hold myself upright, I must have looked completely pathetic.  They kept giggling at me, probably making fun of my utter lack of sobriety.
We ordered the chicken!

Chicken fried rice, spring rolls I think, some beef dish and A LOT of tea.  The table wasn't wobbly, but it felt that way..
It took me ten minutes to realize that I was actually eating the food.  There I was, chewing away at what was in my bowl, but it was nothing special.  Having a hangover doesn't mean I lose my taste for food, yet what I ordered lacked flavour.  
The sobering properties of the tea began to take affect, but the food remained unremarkable.  I was impressed by how clean and efficient the staff here were, I remember seeing a majority of black & brown.  
I was just glad that at least nobody on the street could see pass the tinted windows at my sheer pitiful state.  The girls were nice, and paid for the meal, knowing full well that I was in no shape to count.  
I think the cheque came out to around $40.  

Next thing I remember was sinking into the back seat of someone's BMW while I felt someone's fingers massage at the back of my scalp.

Located close to Yonge and Sheppard, it is a convenient option (if not during rush hour traffic) located close to the 401. There is underground parking for the building. 

We ordered the salmon poke bowl and tuna poke bowl. I liked that the tuna bowl had seasoned sushi rice, garlic chips, kale, seaweed salad, corn, cabbage and avocado and that they offered the flexibility of changing my sauce from wasabi to spicy sauce (same as what is included with the salmon poke bowl). Hubby felt that for $1 more, the tuna poke bowl is a better value over the salmon poke bowl.

The poke bowls are more expensive than the signature bowls at nearby Poke Eats ($12.99). They even offer lobster or king crab poke bowls ($21.99). What I like about this place is that it offers premium sashimi options like uni or Hokkaido scallops for their donburi bowls.  They also sell reasonably priced sashimi and offer takeout trays of maki, sushi and sashimi including uni. 

Japan eats is pretty small, with seating for 2 looking out towards Yonge Street. It is intended mainly for takeout. If seating is full, one can eat in food court or at the seating area inside the main retail space beside the HCafe.",2018-03-25 13:14:46

I have some special needs for my dogs -- I feed them raw food rather than canned or kibble, and one is deaf. Plus, with as many five dogs in my household, I like to keep them together at night, rather than separated into various cages. The staff here didn't balk at any of my requests, and they happily accommodated my needs.

The facility is well laid-out and very clean. The front office is sometimes unmanned (because they're taking care of the dogs), but they're always prompt when someone comes in or in returning phone calls. The main inside play area is separated into areas for small dogs and big dogs, and sleeping quarters are in the rear (individual and shared cages). Bring enough dogs, and they'll let them sleep in the play area overnight. 

The facility also has a ""backyard"" with kiddie swimming pools, so they can get fresh air a few times a day. The arrangement is much better than the dogs sitting in some narrow, stifling indoor/outdoor dog run in the heat of summer. No grass, unfortunately, but I'll take dog playtime and air conditioning over grass any day.

The best part of my experience is how quickly they got to know me. I was surprised that when we arrived to start a second stay at Dog Days, Frances (the owner) and her staff remembered my dogs' names, how they like to play, which one is shy, and which one is deaf.

It felt very claustrophobic to be in the pool. Also, they only had one miniature bar the corner of the pool area. Ladies were free while the guys were $10. Honestly, there are so many better pool parities in Vegas.  Drinks were outrageously expensive even more expensive than Marquee. 

We witnessed a waitress get into a verbal altercation  with some patrons of this pool party. I was disappointed with the employees handled the situation. The waitress actually became irate to the customer who then complained to another employee. This employee then got angry with the patrons who then subsequently complained to the manager who also huffed and puffed. It was just pathetic how these employees at Azure handled the situation.

Hakkasan on a service level is excellent even though I tend to weigh the quality of the food more than the service in my reviews. The decor and ambiance made me feel like I was back in the City in the Bay or some downtown Metropolitan Area. A big area with many partitions that feels private. Wood & Blue.

I don't really eat any Asian food besides Japanese and haven't fucked with Chinese food in a long time. Not a fan of hoisin or fish sauce either....Saying that, Hakkasan is probably the best tasting Chinese restaurant..fuck labels...one of the best tasting restaurants in Las Vegas!

I went with some friends I worked with and we spent a total of around $400.

These are the items we ordered in the order that they came out in:

Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter - Too fishy and not my type of dish

Crispy Duck Salad - This was great balance of duck and greens

Fried Soft Shell Crab & Curry Leaf & Chili - Out of the starters this was the best. With a little bit of rice on the side with soft shell crab...the outside was fried but with every bite, there was a blast of flavor and juices

Stir Fry Black Pepper Beef Ribeye - Very good

Mongolian Style Beef Tenderloin - Out of the two beef dishes, this was more flavorful and tasted better.

Roasted Chilean Sea Bass w/ Chinese Honey - The best dish that we had by far. Buttery, juicy, sweet goodness that seemed to just melt

Passion Fruit Panna Cotta - Perfecto

Chocolate & Black Sesame Cremeux - Not as good as the Panna Cotta but still good

Dirty South Nachos- 5/5 Chicken skins fried and topped with melted pimento cheese. I have always been a fan of the skin of the chicken and this was heavenly for someone who loves fried food... just not very healthy 

Sashimi Tuna Tacos- 5/5 They were perfect especially the sriracha mayo

Flatbread 3/5- It was average to us

Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos- 5/5 They don't look like what you expect tacos to look like but they are really tasty. The watermelon is a unique twist

Sticky Veal Short Ribs-4/5 Solid choice!

Pan Con Tomate- 5/5- Recommended by our waitress and the ultimate favorite of the table

Spanakopita- 4/5 Good but you don't get as much as you expect and it can't beat traditional Greek made

The name of the restaurant kind of translates as ""People's School"". They have a hand menu but also a menu written on the blackboard. They also have some old school stuff here. It totally reminds me of my trip to Korea. 

Food wise, the pork belly we tried is definitely higher quality. Small portions though. Just 200g per portion, but they don't force you to have minimum 2 portions. And price includes some sides. However, I'm disappointed there's no soon tofu or soy bean paste soup which is commonly served with KBBQ. There's also no rice included which I thought should be included for the price point they charge. Menu selection is small but that's ok. In Korea, a lot of restaurants specialize, which further adds to my nostalgia. 

Korean restaurants are notorious for being understaffed. This place however...the service is so good that it's not Korean lol. I've rarely had attentive Korean servers.

It had big shoes to fill, but we were hopeful since it's owned by Michael Morton who is also the co-founder N9NE at the Palms. The restaurant has a rustic chic garden feel. It wasn't too busy on Christmas eve, despite other restaurants being quite crowded. We had a booth in back after asking not to be seated at the high-top bar tables near the entry. 

They offered a nice blend of cocktails, wines and beers. We had Kronenbourg Blanc ($9) and Oro di Milano Riserva ($14), on the pricey side, but I appreciated the rare selections. The menu follows the current trend of small plates and specialty pizzas with a few large plate selections for those who prefer the old school way of dining. We started with the ricotta gnocchi with braised short rib ($16). It's offered as a small plate, but we shared as an appetizer. It's hardly enough for two, but quite enjoyable. The shortrib was rich and decadent. The gnocchi was tender and light, though it had less ricotta flavor than anticipated. 

We each ordered large plates for our entrees. My husband chose the Lamb Sirloin with Brussels Sprouts ($38) and I had the Seabass with Kale ($34). Large plate portions are not for hearty appetites but definitely an upgrade from the small plates. He really enjoyed the Brussels sprouts, and the lamb was tender and cooked medium rare as requested, but there was a flavor that was off putting. He barely touched it. The waiter took notice and offered something else from the menu. After some urging, he chose the wild mushroom pizza ($16). 

The pizza was pretty darn good. The crust was nice and crisp, the fontina was creamy and paired well with the earthiness of the mushrooms. 

My seabass and kale was prepared and served in parchment paper. It was topped with a tomato chutney. The flavors were good, but the texture overall was one note; mushy. It would've been better with some crunch. I tend to prefer fish with a nice sear. 

While dinner might not have been top notch the staff was very accomodating. They went out of their way to be sure we were satisfied. I give them props. They sent out a complimentarty Nutella Crunch dessert for the trouble. Hazelnuts and nutella are a match made in heaven. The dessert did not disappoint.

That attitude is unfortunate because I am a fat tipper and our server ignored us and rolled her eyes at us and otherwise undermined our meal.

Outside seating connected to an indoor area. Dim mood lighting. Relaxed but a notch above casual. 

FOOD:
Entree: Cioppino. 
Translation: Mixed seafood platter atop a savory broth. 

Imagine a shallow bowl containing a generous amount of shrimp, littleneck clams, mussels, striped bass, scallop arranged on top of a savory broth/sauce. A light soup-like consistency, the sauce rests at the bottom of the bowl. The entree comes with two triangle pieces of charred sourdough bread for more broth-dipping action. 

My favorite part of the Cioppino were the scallops and mussels and clams. Those items themselves were delicious, and even more tasty when accompanied with the broth. The bass and shrimp were prepared well, just not as flavorful. Although a generous portion, I would say this is a perfectly sized meal; not a heavy entree at all which to me is a good thing. 

SERVICE:
Our waiter was very knowledgeable and was confident with his recommendations. He didn't pull one of those ""well they're all pretty good, depends on what you like"" lines. Instead he rattled off the top items in each section and even emphasized a few that he highly recommended ""if this is the only time we are ever dining here"". We appreciated his honesty. Waters were kept filled, and he checked up on us regularly, but not overwhelmingly so like a helicopter parent. Ended the night with complementary salted caramels with our checks. A nice touch.

IMPRESSIONS: 
A solid dining experience, but I'm not sure if there was anything that left a special lasting impression. My group of grad student friends (we're the farthest thing from snobs) all agreed we enjoyed the food, but were not blown away. We all ordered different entrees that came highly recommended, which allowed us to sample the popular entrees. With the price point, I think we were hoping for a bit more.

I had their curry last time which was tasty but almost bland. It may have been because I got the last serving but hey it was served to me so that's what I'm judging. I'm a sucker for curries too.

I also had a chicken kabob plate. This was okay. It was kind if bland. Served with a pita, rice, and a salad. This was $8 I believe.

Most recently I got their chicken scwharma over hummus. This was advertised as a special which was lame because I assumed it would be a meal. It was a tin filled with hummus with chicken sliced into it with chickpeas. It had sauce over it and served with a thin very large pita type bread. This was good but more of a shared appetizer. Couldn't eat a large serving of this. The chicken was good with a nice smokey grilled taste to it. This was $8 I believe.

Overall I think the place is affordable for something unique and fresh. Their food is consistent. The place is clean. 

I would definitely return for their falafel but I am still on the look out for a good casual Mediterranean place with good falafel.",2014-08-12 04:49:30

Ordered Chilled Mango (M) for $6.50.
The ice cream is smooth and portion size is good. Didn't taste or see the pomelo pieces and the coconut milk syringe doesn't add much flavour. Mango chunks can be more sweet. They use the fresh mangoes for Mango Popice. 

They make the ice cream on the spot with Kitchen Aid and liquid nitrogen. N2 is poured on the ice cream right at serving for the full effect.

You can order the Frozen Breath, which is a cup of Cheetos with liquid nitrogen. When you eat the Cheetos cold air will come out of your nose and mouth.

Yet, food was just OK. I ordered many small dishes including their yellowtail tartare, Burrata, beet salad with smoked salmon,kale salad, and octopus grilled. All entrées were good with the kale salad being the best of them all. 
For entrées, we ordered the short rib ravioli and a tofu with mushroom and Asian noodles. The tofu with mushroom dish, which is vegan, was outstanding, with phenomenal spices and a lovely overall presence. The ravioli was boring and a little too sour due to some strange sauce on top of it and it just was anything but impressive. Honestly, the best part of the meal was the pretzels that came at the beginning which are equivalent to a bread basket. The downside was they had a horse radish like butter that I did not enjoy but the pretzel sticks were so good that all else did not matter. 
Therefore, it was only a three star experience and food is just OK.

Since Cleveland isn't exactly a mexican hot-bed, maybe I should have set my expectations lower but after I saw it on Diner's Drive-ins and Dives, I figured it had to be nothing less than amazing and decided to check it out for myself.

First of all, Momocho is kind of in a rougher area. Although there is some gorgeous architecture around, the area is littered with homeless people and after walking around a bit my wife and I felt somewhat unsafe. Momocho, however, is quite a nice place inside. It is kind of surprising that it is located there. The feeling of the restaurant is somewhat swanky and upscale. We chose to sit outside (which is thankfully fenced in) and that area was also fairly nice.

We found the staff to be somewhat cold, although not exactly rude. They definitely weren't very helpful, which would have been nice since the menu is extremely confusing. 

The menu options are basically guacamole and taco. The only real choices are what goes on/in them. You can choose between a bunch of different types of guac and the tacos give you the choice of what kind of meat/dressings go in them. We chose the pineapple guac and I got the boar tacos (my wife got pork). 

Although people generally rave about their guac, I found it fairly flavorless and somewhat disappointing. I could barely taste the pineapple. Also, our tacos were VERY salty and vinegary. 

I'm guessing my taste was biased due to my experience with Mexican food but nonetheless, it was disappointing. It was also very expensive. In my opinion, it was overpriced. The food certainly wasn't terrible, but it was very mediocre, and not note-worthy.

I probably won't go back.",2010-07-09 00:36:46

The ambiance of the restaurant was warm and welcoming. The service was good and our needs were attended timely. We sat in the inner hall at a cosy big table under the menu. The same menu is written on the black board and it has only the appetizers and main courses, drinks and desserts are announced by your host and I really prefer to read the ingredients of what I'm consuming.

The lobster poutine is amazing and believe me there is enough lobster in it. I had tomato salad for appetizer, which was not less amazing as the tomatoes were sweet like they have grown under the southern sun or may be the chef had some secret seasoning for them. My main course was the most expensive dish in the house, lobster risotto, but wow, it was freakin good. As my friend wisely explained, when you pay for risotto you don't pay for ingredients, but for work and experience. I managed to dig in the duck with  mousse of foie gras dish and it was pretty good too. The sweet potato creme brûlée was interesting dessert to share, but next time we would rather try something else. 

All drinks we had were solid. The girls fell in love with the Bloody Caesars, they still talk about them more then a month later. I was a little bit disappointed as the Caesars didn't come with the famous snow crab leg in them, just a massive fresh celery and some beef jerky instead.

Unlike most of the Metroparks in the area, there is an entrance fee for Holden Arboretum. It's $10 to see the arboretum itself, and another $4 if you want to do the canopy walk and emergent tower. I think it's a little pricey for a park, but once I had a chance to walk the grounds and do the canopy walk, I could see why. There is a lot of care and intention put into planning this park and there are staff all around the park that are available for patrons to ask questions. The canopy walk itself is not big, it was actually smaller than I expected it to be, but kids will love it. Also, even if you're afraid of heights, this canopy walk is built very securely and there is plenty of netting and guardrails around to keep folks walking on it safe, without disturbing the natural beauty the height offers. The emergent tower is also very secure, but it's design allows it to wobble to compensate for any wind, so those fearful of that might keep that in mind. There are plenty of rest stops between levels, as well as small rest chairs for those that need them. The butterfly garden was small, but lovely and here are plenty of places to throw down a picnic or sit near the waterfront.

Food: 
Pretty good, however, the main reason why they get 4 stars and not 5. It's not over the top impressive but there are some tasty dishes I've enjoyed! 

- Shaken Beef Salad:
Greens topped with Extremely tender pieces of flavorful marinated meat and dressing 

- Grilled Whole Squid 
A dish I never get sick of, sliced grilled squid that comes with a spicy (siracha mayo?) aioli for dipping 

- Hue Spicy Beef Noodle Soup 
Great heat, decent flavor, not a lot of noodles but comes with a variety of different meats 

I've also tried various specials of the day including fresh oysters, king crab legs, whole boiled sea snails (in the shell) - all were tasty and unique

Service:
Very friendly bartenders and servers! Servers are knowledgeable about the menu and provide the specials of the day, which always vary 

Ambiance:

We ordered a plain cheese Big Daddy size since at $16.99 it was only $3 more than the 16"" extra large. We also ordered a garden salad & a ceaser salad. I think the total came to around $24.

I have to say the pizza wasn't as good as I remembered (it's been a few years since I had their pizza.)

The tomato sauce was pretty bland & there wasn't a lot of cheese. I think it really needs some flavorful toppings.  Also, we got the hand tossed and the crust was a little doughy.

I didn't care for the large rectangle that is the Big Daddy size. It reminded me of Little Ceasers or something frozen. Next time we will stick with the 16"" to see if that is a better choice. ( And we'll get toppings to give it more flavor.)

I've never been here for the food so I can't really comment on that. But I can say that I never really can see this place serving food. The building it's self is two big rooms. There is a upstairs seating area as well to hang out or just look down at people. The prices are what you would expect for southside. There's not really any great specials on drinks. There's not really any entertainment here as far as pool or darts goes. It gets crowded fast on the weekends even with being such a big area. There is a shot wheel for the daring to risk what they will get. The dj usually plays bangers to get the crowd hyped up but also hits you with the unexpected. The bathrooms here suck and are usually dirty and going down the steps is extremely cramped to the basement. The staff are friendly from experiences I've had here in the past.

""I need some non Asian friends"", almost pouting.  Then silence.

""Hey, let me try..."" I start, only to be cut off.

""Get your own"" the only reply.

Not your typical Vietnamese eatery, instead an updated approach fusing other Asian flavors and  using ingredients more common in the States.  Hawaii yeeps, think Pig and the Lady done right.  Oh and it's a gastropub.

Lobster pho.  Your typical pho dressed with a whole lobster (it's head sticking out of the bowl).  ""Wash out"" the head fat into the broth, some sriracha for heat and consume quickly.  The lobster, sweet and perfectly cooked when it first arrives, it rapidly overcooks in the hot broth.  Very complex.  The braised oxtail pho, with its almost gelatinous broth equally good.

Pass on the Vietnamese American crab boil.  Instead try the wok tossed Dungeness crab in tamarind sauce (messy, the sweetness contrast with the tangy tamarind), or the diver scallop sashimi topped with tobiko, Serrano pepper, tomato and onion, mint, and a  tangy citrus soy sauce.  Oceanic candy!

Into clams?  Steamed clams with basil and lemongrass, grilled clams or the stronger flavored razor clams with crushed peanuts and scallion oil, razor clam dressed with a soy truffle infusion topped with Serrano pepper slices, garlic flowers, and chives, with a side green papaya salad, or a spicy (similar to XO flavored), giant, wok cooked surf clam.

Not perfect; the clams border on being over cooked, the ""Vietnamese beef carpaccio"" cooked from sitting in the citrus soy too long, and the braised pork belly (similar to Japanese kakuni) using coconut water instead of sake, over braised and crumbling.

Casual vibe.  Off Strip, Asian service.  Large selection of reasonably priced beer.

Simply put, intriguing.",2014-04-02 19:43:59

For some reason until this weekend the only bakery I had been into in Kensington was Cobbs - nice place, expensive, kindof lacking variety.

Walking into My Market Bakery was amazing!
I haven't been impressed by a bakery in a while (I am still missing over-priced Pan Chancho in Kingston) by My Market Bakery brought a smile to my face - so much variety, inspiring ideas for baked goods, and to boot the prices aren't hard on my student budget :)

Since it was early and this was one of our first stops on a meandering walk through downtown, my friend and I decided to just split something to give the place a try. We went with a Mexican Coffe (or mocha?) cookie. For the flat price of $1 we left happy. Overall, the cookie had a great flavour and was generous in size. The only disappointment was that it was rather crunchy - and not really in an its-supposed-to-be-that-way kind of thing.

Four visits on varying occasions have each resulted in different experiences and levels of satisfaction. I love the atmosphere and the overall experience, but the lack of consistency is noticeable and I have heard similar criticisms from friends. 

My first trip to AB was for drinks and a snack during a break from a sporting event downtown. I went over alone (to escape) ordered a Manhattan and an appetizer. The Manhattans were perfect (who stops at one?), and the charcuterie and cheese were terrific and served with some unique accoutrements. However, it was some time before I was able to order that first drink, and in fact, almost left after waiting at the bar for quite some time without acknowledgement - and there were only about 5 other patrons nearby. Once I did get someone's attention, everything was brilliant, but I can never understand a bartender not promptly taking a drink order.

My succeeding trip was very similar to the first, waited at the bar with a friend for an inordinate amount of time before finally having our drink and order of cheese and some appetizers taken. The restaurant was not particularly busy and the bar staff was sort of milling around chatting rather than trying to make money by serving the two thirsty girls in front of them. Once we had our (very well crafted) beverages in hand, everything went swimmingly. This place does a stand out job of mixology and the bartenders, while less than attentive, do know how to make a great drink. 

Third visit - dinner date (no worries boys, it didn't go that well): Service was wonderful in the restaurant and I wish I could recall the waiter's name. We ordered a couple appetizers again went for charcuterie and cheese. The stand out for me was the pate - then again, I am always a sucker for pate. My dinner date had a steak and I had the sweet potato tortellini, which was simply wonderful. 

Fourth visit - birthday party for ten. This was again a super mixed experience. The restaurant seated us in a private room in the back, which was decorated with some very cool photos of Phoenicianicana. I was a little late in arriving so the crew had already devoured several appetizers and a plethora of oysters. From what I heard the mussels were a big hit and they liked the cheese plate as much as I did. The waiter was super nice, answered questions, took our orders and kept everyone's glass full. 

Dinner was a bit of a mess. Two of the guys ordered steaks with the $18 crab add on for a surf and turf, one filet and one rib eye, both of which came out overcooked. One of the gals ordered the crab, and the waiter came and explained it had 'fallen apart' so they were bringing a new one. They did fix the errors, but it is ever so awkward to have part of your party finished with dinner while others are waiting on theirs to show up. I ordered the scallops and they were perfectly cooked, but I had to bite through sand in about half of them, which is just a bummer. After we'd already had so many issues I didn't want to add to the aggravation in sending something else back to the kitchen. 

The GM did come see us, apologized and brought out a round of deserts. In a nice effort he brought two of each of the four desserts on the menu, which we all tried out. The stand out for me was the salted caramel pudding. No one really understood the warm peanut butter gelato, which essentially tasted like peanut butter soup. We were having a good time and we did appreciate the manager and waiter's efforts to apologize and take care of the issues.

The Arrogant Butcher has a pretty sweet little happy hour menu and now that my office is now less than ten minutes away, I will probably be stopping back in to check that out and am certain I will eat here again.

I'd rather have fair pricing on services I'm confident I need rather than rock bottom pricing on services I didn't need in the first place.

Because of this honesty, it's not a surprise that this shop is very busy. However, a busy shop means that it's hard to get work done here unless you have a flexible schedule. At the place I get my brakes and belts changed, I can drop in during lunch, get my work done, then be out in about an hour. That would be impossible at T & M because they're too busy. I live alone, so I can't just drop off my car in the morning and go the whole day without a car. Furthermore, T & M is only open M-F, which I hate since I work M-F. If you're like many Vegas residents and work varied schedules, you can afford to wait at the shop on a random weekday that you're not working. I don't have that luxury.

For larger repairs, I won't go anywhere else. My motor mounts got fixed the last time I was at T & M and they did a great job. Though, because it's inconvenient, I don't bother using T & M for small things. It isn't worth the hassle.",2013-03-19 22:58:35

I was glad to come in, sit down and enjoy a free large meal and drink, while relaxing and watching a game or two or three.

When there used to be a Poker Room, this place would have a long line but the team would get the patrons ready and on their way, back to the casino floor, where they should be.

I love their sandwiches.  Huge portions that are honestly sharable with a side of fries.  

Most people that came in here didn't want to head over to the award winning Studio B Buffet, or simply didn't have the time.

I appreciate the staff, their service and the excellent food that was offered.  

If I ever had to pay for a meal, I didn't feel ripped off like you would on the strip.

The menu has a variety of different drinks and tons of flavors. We opted for a regular yogurt black tea with strawberry popping boba and a supersize taro and vanilla milk tea with regular boba. 

There are only two sizes and our total came out to be about $9.00 for two drinks. The taro w vanilla was a little too sweet for my liking but it was drinkable. The tea was very good and quite refreshing!

I'm glad others mentioned that it was located inside the Mercado.  The door was locked but someone was exiting so I asked if they were open.  The customer, an apparently very intoxicated man, but most pleasant, greeted me and started talking to me like I was an old friend.  The employee, also most pleasant, said they were closed.  When I asked what time they closed she said eight and it was close to 8:30, so I said I would come back another day.  Next thing I knew, she was letting me in and asking me what I would like to order.  I told her I had wanted to try the goat dish, Birria I think it's called.  So they started preparing it for me (to go).  I looked around while waiting and discovered they also have Thrifty Ice Cream, paletas, various Mexican desserts including strawberries and cream, flan, etc, also Aguas Frescas made with real fruit.  I don't eat a lot of Mexican food in Az because it is plentiful in San Diego, but I WILL be back to this place, only a few blocks from where I'm staying.

GRYGN9HhuGv0X4ykaMt00g,WWnhqRnWWjutMqh-2SzEuQ,XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg,5,4,2,2,"Best bread basket ever.  I'm not a bread person at all, and I tend to ignore the rolls that restaurants usually put out with meals, but I would go back to Mesa just for the bread.  There was an herb and asiago and a corn and chile muffin that were just incredible.  The herb and asiago was subtle but not overly so, with just the right amount of cheesiness, and the corn muffin - oh my goodness.  First of all, beautiful - the color of the chiles comes through in a red swirl that makes an appetizing contrast with the dark gold of the muffin.  Texture is spot on - soft and warm and crumbly but not dry, and when you bite into it you find whole kernels of corn tucked inside that really add a little extra.  And of course, it tastes wonderful.  The chiles really give it the perfect kick - I cannot imagine a better corn muffin.  Needless to say, but my friend and I polished off our bread basket in no time and the thoughtful waiter noticed us picking at crumbs and brought us a second.

Uh...so I just spent a significant fraction of my life talking about the BREAD at this place.  It was just so impressive, and I had high expectations for the rest of the meal.  Amazingly, they were not disappointed!  After devouring the second bread basket sans mercy, we ordered a ceviche sampler to start.  The sampler was very pretty, with four square plates each holding spoons topped with tiny tiny tiny little mounds of various ceviches.  Each ceviche had a different flavor to it, and they were all quite good, and we managed to share through some surgical utensil usage.  This was probably the least memorable course, if only because there just wasn't enough tasting to get acquainted, but still superb.

For our entrees I ordered the pan-seared halibut and my friend ordered the chile relleno.  I think I had the better entree, but both were fantastic.  The chile was a thing of beauty, huge and crusted in cornmeal, sitting on a little pool of colorful sauces.  I tried a few bites and it was goooood.  My halibut was heavenly.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was incredible!  The flavor was really deep and rich, almost like a zesty barbecue, and it worked magically with the mild fish.  Sweet red onions were also a nice touch.

This being our last night in Vegas, we weren't about to skip dessert, and we ordered a fresh berry tart with strawberry creme fraiche ice cream and an empanada with peach, mango, and cream cheese filling with a white peach tequila sorbet.  (Seriously, how do you see that described on the menu and not order it?)  Both were exceptional.  The tart was one of the best fruit tarts I've ever had.  It came on a gorgeous puff pastry that was perfect with the fruit and the custard filling.  The strawberry creme fraiche ice cream was light and delicious.  The empanada was like nothing else I've ever eaten, and all those components actually work together like a dream.

And yeah, the place is pretty.  I especially appreciate the colorful decor because of how well it reflects the beautiful colors in the food.  Service is also fabulous.  Pricing - it's expensive, but not overly so.  I'd say the value is great.  And it's Vegas!  I would much rather drop $70 on a meal like this than on a few bad blackjack hands.  To wrap up a rather lengthy and worshipful review - I would go back to Mesa faster than you can say corn muffin.",2008-12-14 01:53:59

I really like their salads, they are full of ingredients and above par in comparison to other pizza places. By the way, for $1 you can add extra chicken to them too. I don't even like extra meat, but for $1, I can't resist. 

I think their pizza is just delish. It's made with a thicker crust than most, but don't let that scare you away if your into thin crust normally. There is something special about this pie, please try. Also, for free you can add 'turbo' to your crust (or any other flavor you want). It is garlic, butter and parmesan flavored crust and is not overwhelming at all, just a hint of extra flavors.

Atmosphere is nice and a great location downtown. In spite of this, management is doing a bad job at running the restaurant. They were out of half their tap beers as well as many of their bottled beers.  How does that happen?  I think alcohol and beer vendors deliver daily. I don't think I've ever seen that before other than maybe a backyard party at my buddy's. Service was extremely lackluster. Servers and food runners basically were doing us a favor by doing their job. Don't ask for a serving spoon to share a salad because if you do, they will give you stink eye, a deep sigh, and if you're lucky, give you a teaspoon.  The fish and chips were one level above Long John Silver. Actually LJS is better and their charcuterie is average at best with horrible presentation and delivery. The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that the beet salad was terrific!  Other than that I would avoid this place at all costs.

So today we rushed over there to check it out. The wife, while born and raised in the Philippines, is of Chinese descent and grew up around this stuff. When you consider that, along with the fact that our first date was ten days together in Hong Kong (dim sum heaven), you can see that the bar is pretty high for us when it comes to dim sum. Now, we know we cannot expect Hong Kong or even San Francisco quality in Phoenix necessarily. Still, the food at Phoenix Palace was quite good overall. We were not disappointed. 

We had two types of shu mai, along with har gow, jellyfish, barbecue pork buns, sesame balls, pot stickers, and spring rolls. We missed the chicken feet, which is one of Carol's favorites, but we'll get to that next time. All was great, but the har gow especially stood out. It was a quite different flavor than what we have had at Golden Buddha, C-Fu or any of the other local places. Everything was yummy though. 

The service, on the other hand, was mixed. It started out nice, with a friendly greeting by the guy that seated us. But it went downhill from there. Its not that they were rude or unfriendly. It was more like benign neglect. The carts came around quickly enough, but once we had the food we did not see anyone again until it was time to settle the bill. No refills, in other words. That said, at least the glasses were large and we had a pot of hot tea, so it was not the end of the world. Another gripe--no chile oil. I  think I'll bring my own next time. Or maybe we just caught them on a bad day.

The food was a four or a five by local standards, while the service was a two or a three. Since I can't give 3.5 stars I'll go with four. It's really nice to see a growing number of decent dim sum restaurants in town. Hopefully this is a trend that will continue.

Good: BACALAO EN ACEITE; my husband ate a lot of this growing up with Mediterranean food. He thought this was done well. CHORIZO; excelente. OXTAIL; rich and tasty. PULPO; the octopus was cook perfectly. Not a pencil eraser rubber.

Missed the mark for everyone:

The above statement should be printed on the menu, by the way.
My friend has been raving about this place for weeks now...and last night I finally stopped in only to find myself waking up this morning CRAVING it again! Yikes. And it's on my commute home from work. I think I am in trouble...

By my friends recommendation, I had the Lava Dog, Shaggy Style. Basically, an all beef hot dog, chili (""lava"") - monterey jack cheese - Maui cole slaw (""shaggy""). The slight sweetness of the bun, bit of salt with the dog and chili topped with the crispness and freshness of the maui slaw creates the perfect balance. Now it's a ""taste explosion"" at a hot dog 'stand'? Better believe it.

Next time, I want to try something different...like the Brat dog or Spam slider. They offer unique toppings for all dogs - maui style - chipotle garlic mayo, maui mustard, coconut and pineapple topping to name a few. I am going to have to go for the shaved ice next time too, especially Amy's recommendation of the ""Tiger's Blood""

Some inside SCOOP on this place, because I asked the owner John (who's super nice) a million questions. The Chili is Vegetarian. The buns are AMA-ZING and it's his own recipe. The buns are baked fresh locally. The brats are made especially for him as well. He was inspired by a place he visited all of the time in Hawaii - while he was surfing! A good enough reason for us Phoenicians to welcome a little ALOHA in our lives.

SOME OTHER THINGS I LIKE?
   - They DO take debit cards, it's NOT cash only. 
   - THEY ARE PET FRIENDLY (Patio, obviously)

We also ended up ordering other dishes on the side, which jacked up the final cost by quite a bit more. The sashimi at Zen was very good, but the soft shell crab and tempura were mediocre. The beef tongue was quite nice though. 

I found that the menu selection here is very small. I don't expect to see 50 different kinds of westernized maki that you can get at your typical AYCE restaurant, but would be nice to see things like chirashi and maybe some other appetizer dishes like takoyaki or okonomiyaki. 

This new Woodbine Zen location is much nicer than the older one, and the food quality is excellent as usual. Great service and enjoyed dinner very much, but after paying $100+/person, I was still hungry. Ended up getting a $8 chicken on rice combo from another restaurant on the way home to fill me up. Would bump up the stars if menu selection is expanded and portions are increased. Understand that good quality fish is expensive, so offer some other filler dishes so I don't leave hungry after emptying my wallet here.",2015-08-09 04:42:35

Not the best but not the worst either. Would I come again was the question but some reason we ended up visiting again many months later.

On my most recent visit, we sat down and while the waitress didn't speak much English and was depending on me speaking Spanish (No habla espanol), it was fine. She ended up bringing another waitress over later on to assist with ensuring our order was correct. This was nice. 

We sat down and received our chips and salsa. Our chips were stale if that is possible. It was like they refried the chips to make them warm but something about them was off. We asked for another basket thinking it was just a bad batch but it wasn't. The salsa however was good. 

We ordered rolled tacos off the appetizer menu. They came out gorgeous and were actually quite good. The green sauce will make them soggy quite quick - so you have to eat them fast. 

I ordered carnitas because it seems that is my go to most Mexican places. It was seasoned well and the rice and beans it came with was standard fare that you will find at all other places. 

My hunny ordered a chorizo burrito and it was just okay. Nothing great but not bad.

The atmosphere was really nice luxe fabrics, black and white vogue photography...a violinist playing numbers from the Sound of Music. 

Our server was an attractive young guy which we certainly didn't mind and he politely read some fantastic sounding specials and offered a couple recommendations.We were even personally escorted to the ladies room which was a nice touch!

 We each ordered a drink ( I ordered a citrus basil martini). Since I tend to talk with my hands I carelessly ended up spilling 1/2 of my delicious $10 martini all over the table..yikes. Well, no problem there as the bus boy scuttled over and quickly changed the table (paper) and I finished what was left of my drink. Someone mentioned something about my drink - at first I thought they said they would replace it, so I was a happy camper. Well after a few impatient minutes I just ordered another drink without looking up and I realized it was the bus boy not the waiter. He said he would talk to my server about it. My back was turned but my friends noticed that when the bus boy tried to talk to the server he literally stuck his hand in the poor guys face and rudely dismissed him. He was bringing me another drink which was nice but it certainly made our waiter seem like a jerk. 

After that service took a huge dip....

Complimentary bread & butter- heavenly. Great crusty bread with soft middle and creamy homemade butter. Wow, great start! 

We ordered two apps and a salad:

Butter Poached Lobster Gnocchi with black truffle fondue ($15)- It was bad. Where was the truffle? Why were the gnocchi WAY overcooked? Why was our lobster the consistency of rubber? It tasted terrible- almost had a distinct onion soup mix flavor. If I had ordered this as my meal I would have been deeply disappointed.

Goat Cheese and Caramelized Onion Tart ($8)- This was better but still not the best appetizer Ive ever had. I only tasted a little bit of goat cheese. 

Red & Yellow Beet Salad ($8) - My friend ordered this but I was able to taste it. This was great! Candied pistachios are my new best friends. 

For dinner two of my friends ordered potato gnocchi ($14) and one ordered the seared scallops ($27). I went with a special ($32)of filet medallions with Bearnaise sauce and crab meat- it also came with a side of lobster mac n cheese. 

I was lucky to try everyone's meal but I only enjoyed mine. The gnocchi was terribly overcooked and visibly unpleasing. They are lucky they served it to my friends because I would have taken it back. The scallops were large (yay a large scallop dish) but over-all the dish was way over salted.My steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The crab meat wasn't very plentiful but it tasted sweet and delicious. The lobster mac n cheese was actually pretty good as well. 

We sat around for a very  long time before our plates were cleared. The restaurant was not busy at this point. Eventually we had to ask for our server and our check. Oddly enough the other server and bus boy exchanged a laugh amongst themselves when we mentioned who our server was. I am not sure what that was about. Our server came over and slapped down dessert menus in front of us. We said we just wanted the check and he was able to split our apps for us which I was pleasantly surprised. 

2, 1/4 apps, a martini, meal, and tip  came to a little over $60 for myself. 

Although I liked my meal no one else liked theirs and service was pretty yicky toward the end. I wouldn't go back on my own accord. If I did go back I would stick to steak.",2011-02-15 14:53:20

I frequented this restaurant with my aunt and loved the authentic Japanese food. The concept of an Izakaya is almost one of a Trattoria for Italians and this place is no exception. The food is exceptional.

I have been here for lunch and dinners and the atmosphere is really one of a Diner Dash game with one or two waitresses serving guests and a few cooks in the open kitchen. Izakaya Ju does not feature your typical Spider and California rolls, but rather, tapas items such as Tongue, Pork Cheek, Conch, Spicy Tuna Sashimi, Gindara slice, and BC Tuna. All the dishes are meant to be shared. My ALL TIME FAVE lunch dish is the Beef Curry with rice which is delish, filling and not expensive.

I was here for dinner and arrived at 8:30pm and the place was packed. We were lucky that one table just finished making room for us. In addition to the regular menu, the restaurant features specials written on the chalk board. I suggest you to try the stuff on the board. The food here is so good and fresh.

For tonight, I ordered a 720ml bottle of sake which comes in at $75 as the cheapest 720ml option. There is some black bottle at $150...in other words, sake is not cheap here. That being said, we ordered the sake of a ""1000 Long Lives"" and it was the hardest, heavenliest, sake I have ever tried. Well worth the $75 bucks.

FYI! When you order the chicken balls, look for the dedicated cook who is responsible for fanning the fire to make the chicken tender and juicy (in order to have that great BBQ taste).

All in all, I love this restaurant. There is another restaurant beside that has a mostly ramen/noodle menu so depending on what you fee like, you will not be disappointed. The place is small, but service is very homely and the food is so, SO, very good.",2011-10-29 04:30:04

Both were pretty decent, but they obviously didn't give us the good cuts so it wasn't like AMAZING-melt-in-your-mouth...

They have a slightly outdated ordering system (numbers, pencil, and paper) which made it a bit difficult to get more things. We were in a separate room from the main room so we rarely saw our waiter and had to ask other waiters to get him.

Some of the items were a bit hit and miss--- like this one slab of rice and sauce on a plate that we got, TERRIBLE! Who thought of that! It was pretty comical when it came. It did not taste good. The tacos were a no as well. The specialty rolls, however, were pretty good! I forget which one it was now, but there was one with scallop and that one was our favourite.

The teppanyaki items were terribly small, but if you order a ridiculous amount (like 15 orders of beef), they'll give you a pretty reasonable (3 orders worth) amount. 

The torched sushi was pretty decent. The other fishies available were pretty fresh, and their desserts were really good compared to other AYCE places.

I'd rate the restaurant a little lower at about 3.5 or 4 stars. The bar is amazing. There is good live piano music and the cocktails are so good - might even be my favorite place for drinks in Scottsdale. Not only are the cocktails great, but the wine list is super extensive and you cannot go wrong with almost any choice.

It frustrates me when people review restaurant on yelp based on the drinks, so I want to clarify that Ocean Club not only has 5 star drinks it has 5 star food. The oysters are probably my favorite in all of Arizona, they are cleaned very well and always fresh, and how can you go wrong when they are accompanied by pretzel bread and garlic toasts!? The salads are also nice to have as well as the shrimp cocktail (they are more like little lobsters). The best thing on the menu thought? The Mac and cheese!!! 

You can't go wrong spending a Saturday night with a drink and some light food at the bar at Ocean Club. 

My only warning: it is an older crowd. So if that is something that turns you off, it might not be for you.",2013-08-06 03:16:03

I was expecting it to be a little bit grungy inside (like most small venues) but to my surprise it was quite clean and pretty modern. Seating with a few tables along one wall and a long bar on the other wall. The ceilings are quite high making this place feel very spacious for a smaller venue and there is a nice balcony, which I assume is for VIP's. 
 
The site lines are pretty good and with a venue like this you are usually able to get pretty close to the stage. The sound quality was OK but not spectacular. The crowd was mostly young people and was quite energetic (this can be credited to Fitz and the Tantrums as they did a good job of getting the crowd into it). 
 
This place gets bonus marks for having a few local beers and being within walking distance from Ossington subway station, making it very easy to get to.  I would be happy to return to this venue for another show.

My party of four had an excellent time celebrating a birthday.  Two had the short ribs.  Tender to a fault, served with delicious Bar-B-Que sauce and pecan grits.  One had the fillet with a spicy aioli and delicious potatoes.
My meal was a huge pork chop, stuffed with Maytag bleu on a ancho bread pudding.  

For an app I split the chop salad.  It deserves special mention and I do recommend it, but it is not a sustaining salad, more of a amuse-bouche.  For dessert we split the peanut-butter cheese cake, delicious.

The beverages deserve some mention.  The wine list is this restaurants' only fault, it is tooooo long.  There is a smaller, delicious by-the-glass selection.  The beer selection is well crafted.  I had two of my favorite beers, Dogfishhead Chicory Stout, something I had only had by bottle, wonderful.

The flavor of the broth was excellent and I slurped most of the broth down. Loved the meat on the oxtail. The noodles amount they give you was just right as well. They didn't give way too much noodles like other places.

Ty (branch mgr) and Aaron was going to give me the van for no extra charge for a day or two as I waited for another vehicle to switch with or until I was able to speak to the third party insurance company paying for my rental. I decided to take the small car as I didn't need anything big like the van or the F150 truck they had. Plus, I didn't want to have a gas hustler. Long story short, I called the next morning to see if they got any cars I could exchange with as the one I had was way too small for the two car seats I needed. Unfortunately, they didn't.

I do have to say, the ""warning"" sign on the tables was a bit much.  I know people do waste a lot of food at buffets, but it is not welcoming to be threatened with being charged for unfinished food.  It is a buffet and sometimes I take things to try that I absolutely don't like.  I'm not going to eat them just because of your threats!  

I was in the area and convinced my husband that we should finally try this buffet.  It was a Friday night and while it was crowded, it wasn't overwhelmingly so as the tables are well spaced out.  I was in the mood for sushi so I started there.  There were about 10 types of rolls, four of five types of pieces and four types of sashimi.  They also had the sauces to add if you wanted to.   None of the rolls or pieces I ate were out of this world or extremely memorable, but they were tasty.  Most had at least one type of sauce on them, though, so if you aren't a fan of sauce on your rolls, you won't like this sushi.

Aside from the sushi, they also have a selection of the typical Chinese buffet fair.  My husband tried a good number of those dishes and again said they were tasty but nothing overly memorable.  They did have a few dim sum options which was a nice touch.

Overall, it was pricey (around $20 per person) but if you went somewhere else and got an appetizer, salad, entrees and dessert, you would be paying at least that if not more.",2014-02-27 21:41:38

The cocktails are simple, fresh, and delicious. I've had three of them and liked them all pretty well. Personal favorite is the Wheelhouse. Fairly solid beer selection too, including Schlitz. 

Somehow I have an appetizer addiction, and Tempest helped fill my addiction. The seafood tower might not be worth the money - I'd just get oysters and clams a la cart. Last tower we got had some sketchy crab on the top which was a big turn off. The smoked fish platter is spot on -- you can't miss this. Also the scallop and clam apps are both very tasty.

Main courses have been nice also. Seems like the special is always pretty awesome. It's weird though - they seem to run out of things a little too often. Heads up: the lobster roll has lettuce inside of it, so make sure to get that removed. The sturgeon was okay - I think it's a personal thing. I also had the trout which was yummy.

She only knew of the one in Mesa but I stumbled upon this one while out for a ride on my bike, motor-less. Decided to take her there for a couple reasons a) cuz she's pretty cool and b) cuz if I don't like it I can totally rip on her and her tastes.

But dang! I really loved this place! So what if I'm in search of the best pizza in a city new to me? This pizza was so good I couldn't even bother comparing it to my fave 'back home.' 

We split a chicken caesar salad. The dressing was tasty and I really enjoyed the pulled-style all white chicken. Then onto the pepperoni and mushroom pizza. I loved how thin and crispy it was, the pepperoni was of really exceptional quality but it literally comes down to the sauce. Yeah, it's not just a catchy name for the joint; it makes the pizza!

My only complaint would be the selection of beer. Wine is becoming more and more accessible and I can totally get on board with the idea of wine and pizza or wine and just about anything else, but sometimes I want a beer. They have maybe 6 brands of beer and some are totally appropriate, such as Peroni. I just would like to have seen a bigger selection.

And I think someone else has mentioned the fact that the restroom is very small; true. It wasn't crowded when we were there so I think I'd be pissed if I'd been drinking and it was crowded and I did need to go.

They have a clean facility and wonderful doctors. The day after Christmas, I woke up to a depressed lethargic dog, so I rushed her over to Arrow. 

They diagnosed her with Parvo, which is a terrible terrible disease spread by other infected dogs and is virtually impossible to kill or cure. There are treatments however, to which the doctors promptly got started on. I was really nervous as I watched her give my puppy an IV drip along with 5 other injections, mostly because I was going to be sent home with all these things that I was going to have to administer myself twice a day. I asked about 200 questions and the Dr. was so nice and helpful and very informative. She gave me an after hours number to call if I felt uneasy or had anymore Q's as well. 

The next day, she called me first thing in the morning to see how the pup (and myself) were doing.. And everyday after that, she called again, up until my dog got better. I really appreciated this. Not only that, but every single person working there genuinely cared about my dog, and it showed with how they treated her each time we went in for followups. I love all of them.

(Please excuse me for a moment. I need to wipe this embarrassing drool off my face before I continue.)

Alrighty! So, here's where I'm at with Phnom Penh. It's pretty much my favorite (Asian-style) take-out in Cleveland.  It has a very convenient location for me, you know, since it's right up the street from the crib. Plus, if I ride my bike there I won't feel so bad about the calories I'm about to shovel down my face. I'm getting so good at justifying my ""feasts"". 

The menu is an indecisive person's nightmare. It would be a little bit of an understatement if I said it was huge. But, everything I've tried has been delicious! In fact, I'm super picky about Pad Thai, but Phnom Penh hit the nail on the head for this gal! You can order it super spicy and it comes out red! I can't stand it when you order this dish at other restaurants and it literally tastes like they mixed rice noodles and veggies with Jiffy peanut butter. Gag me. It's supposed to have a kick and a SLIGHT sweetness to it! Phnom Penh, me thinks you are the God of Pad Thai. My other favorite item (so far) is the wonton soup, which is perfectly seasoned and fresh! After you eat it you don't feel like you're going to shrivel up like a raisin from all the salt/msg. 

You can actually sit down and eat at Phnom Penh too, although I prefer to take-out my food. The boyfriend and I ate there recently and although the service and food was great, you can't help who comes in the door. What do I mean? Well, my life flashed before my eyes when an insanely intoxicated homeless man stumbled in, yelled angrily and reached into his pocket. The waitress handled it perfectly though (and quite bravely). I think this is probably something they're accustomed to dealing with since they're on W. 25th Street and all.  Regardless,  for future Phnom Penh food cravings I think I'll opt for the safer take-out route. 

A little tip, they actually do accept credit cards for food orders over $15. Don't let the ""cash only"" vibe scare you away from trying some of the best Cambodian food in Cleveland.

Yes, the tour itself isn't much. Everything they have fits into a small space that's probably the size of a mechanic's garage. But JJBC more than makes up for that with the beer tastings. Their passion for great craft beer shows in the way they describe their product and in the way they share it with you.

I particularly enjoyed their Tahoe Blue Nevada Pale Ale, their JJ Pro Am California style steem beer (purposefully misspelled to avoid legal issues), and of course their Hop Box Imperial IPA. They also let you try ""green"" beer. No, not the colored stuff they serve up on St Paddy's Day. I'm talking about beer that isn't quite ready for the public, but they are willing to let some flow directly from the tanks.

If you aren't into beer, fret not. JJBC also makes some tasty root beer and cola. Their root beer is actually very good.

Buy local. Drink local. That's their unofficial slogan. I wholeheartedly agree!",2011-08-27 07:45:49

Restaurants can roll out the red carpet for the hordes that flock to their tables, often for the first time, excited to try a new spot without dropping a ton of money. Or, restaurants can turn Golden Coral, farming the same hordes through with no thought given to providing a positive experience that would encourage someone to come back. Unfortunately, Chima went the Golden Coral route. 

We showed up at 9:15pm for our 9:30pm reservation and were told it would be a 45-minute wait. When I questioned the half-hour wait on a reservation, I got a snotty, ""Your reservation guarantees you a seat. It does not guarantee you a time."" We should have walked out then and there. But nooooooo, Ted had to have all the meat. As warned, we received a text at 10pm that our table was ready AFTER dropping $25+ at the upstairs bar. I think this whole wait thing is a ploy to get you to spend money at the bar.  

Once seated, things did not improve. Our waitress explained the $35 versus $54 menus ($54 option included better cuts of meats -- filet, fish, lamb, etc.  and desert) and then disappeared. We couldn't have requested the upgrade even if we wanted to. Accepting our $35 fate (and after a visit to the salad bar which was the highlight of the night), we turned our chips over to ""yes please"" and waited. And waited. And waited. 10+ minutes after telling the gauchos we were ready for all the meat, a skewer of sausage showed up. I really wanted flank steak but, ok. Sure. I'll take a sausage. Who knows how long it'll be before another offering comes by. (5-minutes, BTW.) The sausage was just average -- flaming hot as if it had been microwaved. All of the meat was way over salted. I think it was intentional, to shut diners down and keep everyone from eating them out of house and home. 

Throughout the evening, out plates were not cleared and we never saw our original waitress until it was time for them to force the check on us. We told our waitress we were waiting on the flank steak and she assured us she would send it right over. No joke, 20-minutes later, we flagged down a buss boy, begging him for our check, and left $75 poorer. 

This wasn't our first time to Chima, but it was certainly our last. Honestly, I'd rather go to Golden Coral. At least they're friendly and attentive there with no waits! Seriously though, the salad bar was the ONLY thing at Chima that saved the night from total mediocrity. Oh! And I wouldn't be caught dead in Golden Coral. ;)",2017-01-28 01:37:33

A little stingy on the coconut meat.  Its also a little hard on the go because you need to open the lid and eat it with a spoon.

My friend got the three bean drink.  I tried it and I really liked it!!  The bean was super smooth and not gritty at all like the other places i've tried.  It was sweet, smooth, thick and went perfectly with the coconut milk.  SUch a surprise!  I might even order it next time.

Needless to say I took one bite of the cold noodle and it wasn't hand made, it was the store bought noodles you cook in boiling water. The broth was so salty, and the spicy buckwheat noodles tasted like pure hot pepper paste + vinegar and again salty. I took literally two bites and left.

I love the simple regina pizza with smoked buffalo mozzarella.  The burst of tangy tomatoes combined with smoky cheese is a definate comfort food. 

On this occasion I sampled their house made mozzerella cheese plate with all the meat choices. Spicy salami and prosciutto are the winners for me. Also their mozzerella is the best I have had and look forward to having its salty goodness again.

I also tried the connoli, but like their tiramisu I am not of fan of the current dessert recipes and hope they improve them to same standard as their pizzas.

Thanks Novanata for the delicious meal.",2015-01-05 17:36:13

It's definitely not your average date night restaurants, ringing in at close to $50/pp, But this makes a great special occasion restaurant choice. They're extremely busy on weekends, but luckily they take reservations (get those Open Table points, y'all) and they also have a ton of tables. 

The selection here is great --- the salad bar is vast. I cannot even begin to tell you the bounty that they bestow upon you. Luckily for you, they list most of their options on their website to glance over what you're getting yourself into. As far as the main reason you go is concerned, the rodizio style meats, they are second to none. Cooked to perfection, seasoned with purpose & sliced fresh table side, right onto your plate (if you didn't know, it's all you can eat too). 

I've never had room for dessert here because I'm too busy over-indulging in all the delicious food. Definitely a place to put on your Charlotte 'bucket-list'. If you're patient ... this is also on Queen's Feast/Restaurant week every July & January to save you some $$.",2015-09-10 18:52:21

The salads and pastas here are not their forte- maybe it's just the dressing, but the antipasto salad had ample toppings but nothing interesting going on flavor-wise. Meat quality seemed just so-so, and the ""house italian"" looked like it was packed with herbs but tasted more like plain oil. Fellow diners who opted for pasta specials mentioned that they were overcooked and mushy rather than al dente as expected.

They have a limited list of lunch specials ($7, five options) and outdoor dining tables with umbrellas.

The meats were good and the price is reasonable but after grilling and grilling, the grill becomes coated with burnt bits that gets onto the meat.  So, most of the meat you eat is coated with burnt bits :(

Sure enough, the bar, my chair are sticky. Disgusting. The stainless steel coolers, sinks, counter tops should be shiny & clean. You can see sitting at the bar, the grime on them! 
Bartender is very nice & friendly! I ordered lobster pizza and lobster bisque. The pizza is ok, but the lobster bisque is awful.

Newks ( a sandwich chain) has incredible lobster bisque and they are a deli! Great taste, texture, pieces of lobster in it, yet this is a seafood restaurant serving this microwaved canned tasting bisque?

We didn't get onto the court till 7:30pm because we were waiting for staff to give us an orientation and another group was on the court that we've booked. We had to explain to multiple staff to get our hour session when they cut us off at 20 minutes and told us to go to the open court with no dodgeball. We had a team member to monitor our group to ourselves but he kept on disappearing and other team members was saying our time was up and we had to move to another court. We were wasting our time transitioning from one court to another more than once because staff said we shouldn't be here. At that moment, we were all all annoyed.

The food was just like Chuck E Cheese. We got pizza and pop (coke, sprite, and ice tea). The pizza overall was good, however the pop was water down. 
The decor needs improvements because it looked tired and dull. Not a nice place for nonparticipants (parents, friends, and children) to sit around. The skybar smells like B.O. and there was no air conditioning. The parking lot had tons of pot holes. The washroom was smelly and dirty (no place to change). 

This is a sweaty sport, so we brought a change of clean clothes but went straight home to shower because we couldn't bear to change in the bathroom.

I have been read by both Jane and Lisa, and I love the both of them! They both have different approaches and techniques when they do their readings but at the most part they are spot on. 

They get pretty booked for readings so I advise you to schedule an appointment so that you have a guaranteed spot opposed to walking in. Upon entering Karma Connections the receptionist is to your left and you'd inform her that you have a reading appointment, you will proceed to pay and she will direct you to a little room at the end of the store to meet with either Lisa or Jane. (If you prefer a certain reader then Jane usually works weekends and Lisa are on weekdays.) 

Reading Prices: 15 minutes =$20, 30 minutes =$30, 45 minutes =$50, and 60 minutes =$60.

I have had a 30 minute reading session but these ladies go into depth with what they pick up so I recommend a 45 minutes or 60 minutes session. They will ask you what you want to know about and from there they tell you what they pick up as you guys go on in a conversation. They provide you a pen and paper for you to write down notes and Lisa gives you the option to record her session. For those who are out of state or do not have time to travel to Karma Connections they offer over the phone readings as well. They accommodate you.

Lisa and Jane are both certified in what they do (you'll see it hanging up on the wall), which gives you a sense of verification that they are legit. They do not know anything about you except for your first name so really there is no way that they obtain information from other sources. Also, they have spiritual items that people could purchase: dream catchers, magic candles, healing stones, and more. Overall, I loved my experience. This place is welcoming and prices are affordable.",2017-01-17 01:49:19

The sweet corn fondue appetizer was a definite highlight of the lunch.  I had thought that the cheese might drown out the flavor of the corn, but both flavors held their own very well.  The chanterelle mushroom and goat cheese omelet I had as my entree was okay but not outstanding.  I did, however, enjoy the mesclun salad that came with the omelet, especially the vinaigrette and fried shallot slices.  Dessert was a semolina cake with macerated fresh peaches and cream cheese ice cream (think cheesecake flavored).  The bookends of my meal were so delicious that I wasn't all that disappointed by the middle portion of it.

While I can't afford Casbah on a regular basis as a grad student, the prices aren't exorbitant.  There's even a lunch special for $14, which gives you two courses: either a salad or cup of soup, and your choice of a pasta, risotto, or half a sandwich.  I didn't choose this option, but it seems like a reasonably-priced way to sample several things on the menu.

Our server was very professional, and checked on us after every course (the appetizer, entrees and dessert).  I'll definitely keep Casbah in mind for special occasions in the future.  It's classy without being pretentious or stuffy.",2010-08-26 20:40:35

I've been watching a lot of strictly dumpling on YouTube and tried this place out with my buddy. I've never had Szechuan peppercorns and it is truly a unique heat.

They specialize in numbingly spicy dishes that you eat with a cool tea for balance. The staff literally walk around refilling mugs for the patrons. On the menu they have hot or cold dishes, dumpling or noodle dishes, and meat or vegetarian dishes. They also have appetizers that are pretty unique: my favorite being their steamed egg served in a mug with spicy ground meat.

Each main dish comes a certain way but they have add ins like extra meats or a fried egg. I opted for their chef recommended beef noodle soup. I added short ribs and intestines. These add ins are a couple bucks and served in a separate bowl of broth that they're cooked in I'm assuming. I don't recommend dumping these into your main dish as it alters the flavor. 

The hot soup with the spicy peppercorns will get you sweating even if it's cold out. The tea they serve is unique and I do recommend getting a lot of refills. 

Overall I thought this place was okay. They have terrible service. I don't think they should do sit down style ordering because they don't come by to take your order. I had to go up to the register after being their for 15 minutes to order. I advised the couple next to me to do the same after I heard them getting impatient. We also had to go up to pay. They have a lot of potential with their location if the staff would just leave the register and take some orders and refill drinks.

The food itself was okay. They dish I got was good but nothing cravable. Also the meats I ordered were cooked well but served less than luke warm and not too flavorful. The heat from the peppercorn was definitely an experience but the overall flavor was a miss. If anything their egg appetizer and mushroom appetizer were things I'd get again. With so many other Szechuan restaurants in the area I'd not come back here anytime soon.",2018-01-10 06:51:14

The place is beautiful inside with it's ridiculously high ceilings, massive pieces of artwork along the walls and floor to ceiling windows that line one side of the restaurant.  Love the atmosphere. 

I came here and had the following: 
- fried squid that came with aioli and a red pepper dip (pretty good but standard)
- piquillo peppers stuffed with oxtail & manchego (lovely, the oxtail was tender and the manchego gave it a melt in your mouth texture)
- fideo pasta with clams & chorizo with a huge dollop of aioli that was mixed in at the table by the server (this was delicious but not your standard ""pasta"" it's not saucy so you have to re-set your expectation if that's what you're thinking). I asked for chili flakes which the server misunderstood and provided chili sauce, which was even better!  The chili sauce is delicious, not on the vinegary side and slightly sweet.  I'd get it just to compliment any dish. 
- broccolini with almond garlic gazpacho & garlic chips (perfectly sauteed and the gazpacho was good but didn't taste like almonds, I couldn't figure out what it exactly tasted like)
- lemon mousse olive oil cake - yummeh!  Not too sweet, a bit on the dense side for mousse but I enjoyed it. 
- churros - can't go wrong with churros and the dulce de leche makes it that much better

They have macaroni pie.... MACARONI PIE! It's basically macaroni and cheese but they make it in this pot so it's like upwards macaroni. It keeps its shape. It's delicious. Finally, a place I can get macaroni and cheese for 4$ and in less than 4 minutes.

They also have their own Montréal made soda!  hibiscus , bark, and ginger flavoured. I got to sample them but I'm really not a soda person. They aren't fizzy and the hibiscus one is really sweet!

I tried their jerk fries(4$) and their chicken patty. I really enjoyed both. The spices in their jerk sauce is just spicy enough that I can tolerate it( meaning I taste how spicy it is but I can still discern flavour). 
Their chicken patty is so goooooood. I had yet to find a good chicken patty and they made the perfect one. A bit on the pricier side than most other patty's out there(3$), but worth it! 

Prices on the menu include tax. 

The place is really small so be prepared to get your order to go unless there's no one there. 
It's really nicely decorated!

I had no trouble making a reservation one day in advance unlike at other nearby -licious restaurants, which might say something about either Midi's (lack of) popularity or tendency to overbook. The latter is probably the case since the place was packed around 12:30PM and since tables are relatively close together, it felt a bit claustrophobic, but manageable.

We were actually all pleasantly surprised by the Summerlicious food! The pasta/risotto mains were big portions, which we weren't expecting. And we all adored the pastas (seafood, vegetarian, vegan) and seafood risotto... Even the Italian in our group ;) The scallops were said to be amazing, very fresh and tender, though not big. The appetizers were A-OK with the vegan soup of the day (gazpacho) being fairly large and very refreshing and cooling, but the salad appetizers were disappointingly small and lacking in variety. The prosciutto in the salad received some love, again from our Italian friend, as it was particularly lean. The desserts were very meh, but the creme brulee was well-received.

Vegans, have no fear as Midi can accommodate you, particularly if you notify them in advance when making the reservation! I had my main modified to be vegetarian pasta with tomato sauce rather than pesto white sauce. I got more creative with the dessert, as all the options contained dairy, to substitute raspberry sorbet for ice cream, keeping the peach (comes from a can, kind of disappointing), and omitting the chocolate sauce.

Service- 3.5/5. Very nice and accommodating (clearly, as they were able to make great adjustments for this vegan here who stupidly came to a French bistro), but slow and unobservant. We never got water refills and 2 of our guests waited so long to receive cutlery and waters. Food came relatively fast though, but expect to spend 2 hours here for -licious.",2017-07-18 22:26:53

We went on a Sunday night, the place was empty. We were promptly seated at a two-top near the kitchen. The ambiance was laid back yet sophisticated. The serving staff were professional and knowledgeable. 
My only qualm about the whole evening was that the bottle of Red wine I ordered, was served way too chilled. I'm not a Cork Dork by any means, but I do have a basic knowledge of wine, and wine serving etiquette. 
None the less, as the evening progressed the wine warmed up and the flavors came out. 

As far as food, my lady and I each ordered 3 or 4 plates the first go around. The server intelligently coursed them out herself, sending out the lighter dishes first in pairs and moving into the next two, etc. I thought that was slick. She could of just dumped 8 plates on us. 
The Short Rib was tasty as all hell, I watched my girl's eyes rolled back into her head as she nibbled on the first bite of that dish. 
I was thoroughly pleased with everything in that round so much that we each ordered 2 more dishes. The not-too-clever anymore ""bacon and eggs"" was delicious, no matter how many times I've had it at other places.

I never knew what to order, as the selections were expansive, intricate, and overwhelming! Luckily, they have a new menu (with clever headings), and more options for the folks that want something simpler, like me!

The Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake was actually very good. Rich in chocolate flavour, while still being light and fluffy. Not something you get in a cheesecake very often!
My friend got the Last Straw Crepe. The crepe was beautifully thin and the ice cream was pleasantly sweet and light. Topped with strawberries, it was delightful!

Just the burro!  I bit into it & the tortilla was hard and almost cold.  I have never had a ""hard"" burro in my life, and I'm hoping never to have one again; it's not a good thing.

It is also very close/walking distance to a lot of restaurants.

This is going to be one of the better dining places at the Palms. We went during their soft opening and went all out. We came in for our reservation on time and we immediately walked over to our table. We were asked for our drinks orders and given a menu to take a look at their options. We decided to do it family style and EAT ALL THE THINGS!! 

We started with some appetizers. First my plus one order egg drop soup, her fav thing besides rice. Next we ordered the potstickers, they came 6 to a plate. We were then offered the Green Bean Jelly as well as the Garlic Cucumber dish. Each item came out one after the other.. The next more delicious than the last. My favorite app was the potstickers. They were hot and delicious, but I had to save room for the rest of the delicious food. After we almost filled ourselves with apps, our main dishes started coming out. First we got the fried rice we order. We decided on the the pork and chicken combination. The rice was hot and flavorful. The only thing I didn't like about rice was the Chinese onions. I'm not a huge fan of onions, and if i can see them I just pick them out. Otherwise is complemented the other dishes perfectly. Next we received the Mongolian beef. This was my favorite dish. It wasn't tuff and it almost melted in my mouth. Next was the Tony's Chicken with Three Chili. I was super excited to try this dish. It was spicy and chicken and i love both of those things. I had at first chosen the chef special dry chili chicken but was recommended to get Tony's. Now, I like spicy food and my plus one doesn't. After taking a few bites I told her to try it. It wasn't spicy at all, it did have chilis in it but the actual chicken wasn't spicy. I was the most disappointed by that. I even told the waiter I loved spicy food. We move on. 

The service was why this remained at 4 stars. Our waiter was helpful and funny. He walked us through the menu and made some killer decisions when it came to the appetizers. He also placed our napkins in our laps and even filled our plates when the food came out. YUM. We ended up needing like 3 boxes for leftovers. My last negative was the food temputure. I felt like it could have been hotter on the chicken and beef. I mean it tasted fresh but I'm not sure why is wasn't a hot plate.

I rarely, very, very rarely eat Chinese, Thai, Japanese, etc. With the exception of sushi. I don't know, call me a white-bread-eatin' American? The thing is I am excited to try new culinary cuisines, but Asian-inspired dishes just are not my cup of tea for some reason. The spices, the tastes... they just don't hit my palette like Italian and Mexican dishes do.

With that being said I think Cafe de Japon is A-OK. It would probably be bumped to 4 stars if I truly enjoyed Japanese food. On my trip here I had the Pre-Fixe lunch menu. It came with a small salad - very good and fresh. Next was the agedashi tofu appetizer, which I thought was okay. I'm not a huge tofu fan, and even this hearty dish failed to get me super excited about it. For my main course I had the tororin omelet with rice. It was hearty and rich, plus the ketchup gave it a taste as though it had been cooked in a kitchen at a home. 

Lastly I had the siphon coffee, which was FABULOUS. I would come back for the coffee, but probably not anything else.

Killing time at the mall before meeting up for a work summit, we had a blast trying on shoes, sifting through bikini racks and checking out everything the store had to offer. 

When I was making a purchase at one of the counters the saleswoman commented on how they were currently in the final phases of a major overhaul. Noticing how lovely the layout was and how each section at Nordstrom looked like its own boutique, she mentioned that it was all brand new. Feeling jealous I told her, ""But I come from the land of Nordstrom and our isn't even this nice!"" With a big smile she handed me my bag and suggested I check out the shoe section. So I did.

And thank you Yelp for informing me of this place. And also thank you restaurant.com for the coupons for this place. (which i forgot to bring for the occasion, but it will come in handy when I go back)

I had set up for an early Valentine's Day and Anniversary dinner here with the bf on a Wednesday evening. Our reservation was at 5:30pm. I had planned it that way in hopes to see the sunset from the wonderful outdoor seating at the lake. But we were too busy admiring the restaurant, wine, and food to notice the sunset. But that's okay. I picked a wednesday for an early celebration because I figured it would be quieter and they had live jazz. Which the gentleman was very nice and I liked his music selection.

So when we arrived, the hostess was very welcoming. After getting seated (we were the only table in that section at the time), the server told us if we wanted a bottle of wine to pick any out and just bring it back to the table, and so we did. The pricing is great for bottles.

The restaurant is quite nice. When you enter through the double glass sliding doors, you enter into the wine shop and bar area. There is 3 sections of seating, 1 area inside and 2 areas outside.

So for the first course, we ordered the ""Bacchus"". It looked different from the one I saw in the pictures posted here... so I posted my own. It was quite nice, with the lobster salad, different cheeses, and other stuff that I don't remember the names of. It came with a small basket of bread, which definitely was not enough for us so we had asked for another basket. It was yummy.

For the main course I could not decide for a while because I really wanted to try everything! But I ended up ordering the Lobster Pot Pie because that is their signature item, and the original plan since I had looked at their menu before we went. And the bf went with Moule Frites.

I was slightly disappointed that the frites were just regular fries and not the thinner ones like what they have at Mon Ami Babi. Oh well, still good. The flavor of the moules (mussels) were great. They were cooked perfectly and you can really taste the wine through the dish. It was great to dip the bread in it also. Mmmm

And my pot pie. I was told it was similar to Michael Mina. It was very rich and had lots of spinach. Good amount of lobster as well. I liked that their was corn in it. Picture of the item has been posted. The small metal pot that it was served it was topped with a cute round pastry puff. Very flakey. 

While enjoying the appetizer, the server had asked us if we wanted the bread pudding. It mentions on the menu it takes half an hour to make so I went ahead and ordered that too. Came out just in time. And the flavor of the dessert was amazing. It was very strong in scent and taste of cinnamon which I love. And there were raisins.

Overall a fantastic experience. A small menu, but with plenty of good options. I nice hidden gem.

And on the drive home I realized how close it was to our house, so I will definitely be going back soon. Probably to try their lunch cause it seems the items are completely different. And it would be a completely different feel. This place is great with service, food, and price. Worth a try :)",2011-02-16 19:47:46

My filet mignon was awesome, very buttery and tender. Let's face it, the steak is the most important part of these restaurants and it exceeded expectations. My husband chose the wagyu and that was even better than the filet mignon. We shared the  pureed potato trio which was awesome.

THE FOOD

So for the Russians out there, this place has a huge variety of . For the Ukrainians out there, you already knew that :)

Besides variety of Pierogis that you can either buy from the fridge and cook on your own (actually, just 5 minutes in hot water, as they are pre-cooked), you can also order any of them to eat right there. We've tried a few types and liked them all, obviously some more than other, personal preferences and all. There are also a few more types of food (sausages and what not), that I can't comment on just yet, but expect them to be good.

There is also some food for sale (pickles, caviar, soups, some awesome syrups, bread, etc.) so you can walk away with a variety of things to eat.

SETTING

For the restaurant portion, it's just two tables for four each.  They plan to expand to that soon, which I am definitely looking forward to, so I can bring some more friends (at the same time).

SERVICE

Good! There were numerous take out orders, so our orders came out a bit slower, but we accounted on that from the beginning. It was definitely worth it.

Whether you are a hops and malt enthusiast, or a discerning craft beer drinker, OWB  will be the type of local brewery that will have something for your palate.  Throw some colorful characters in to the cask, mixed with one or two patrons inebriated by beer, and you have a fun little Happy Hour.

Upon my recent visit, I was greeted by John the Barkeep.  With dirt under his nails, left-overs in his whiskers, beer stains on his shirt, and a laugh so gravelly and jovial that you want to make a ringtone out of it - I felt immediately at home.

Not to mention, the quotidian appearance of the small warehouse with its smattering of old couches and dartboards - and some well placed wooden stools at the bar - made me feel as though I had just walked into a neighbor's backyard pop up brewhouse.  

Come here with the sole intention of drinking well crafted beers, and waffling on with the staff.  Don't let anything else sway your opinion.

Back to the brews...

I sampled 7 of their 8 beers on tap.  One of them was the Root Beer.  The ""Cowboy Southwest Root Beer"".  This particular Root Beer has an herbal extract, along with pure cane sugar.  The mesquite bean syrup gives it that old fashioned flavor, (and I delighted in it so)  All of this, lovingly delineated by Geoff Lowell, OWB's public relations guy.

Other pours of note were the Honey Wheat made with local honey and unfiltered wheat (looks like a Hefeweizen, drinks like a Blue Moon) Our favorite!

Nitro blonde ale 4.5% which was ""clear, crisp, and dry, with low-to-medium bitterness and aroma. Semisweet from the special European malts used in the mashing process.""

The Dark knight porter was outstanding!!!  With its Chocolate and Coffee notes, Geoff recommended a Porter float with vanilla ice cream.

Also memorable was the Belgian Ale, a seasonal beer that took me straight to Bruges on the first sip.

OWB has seasonal ales that they offer throughout the year, including a Summer ale with local prickly pear fruit.  However, the boys wanted me to be clear that ""we don't do fruity beers.""

Should you get hungry while quaffing your ale, there is a food truck outside that cooks up Fish and Chips, Burgers and Fries, and Philly Cheese steaks.  John even made mention that they will happily create some beer-infused victuals for you.

OWB closes at 7 during the week, so it's always HH when you come into OWB.  Weekend hours are varied as they will stay open later if a crowd is there.  Generally that happens when they have a band.

To conclude this intoxicating tale - if you have enjoyed one of their brews immensely and want to take it home, purchase a Growler with the beer of your choice.  For $15 you get 64 ounces of malted bliss, and can bring the empty Growler back for $7 refills.  What an amazing deal!

John sent us on our way with our Growlers with these final words...""Put this in the trunk of your car and drive like you're moonshiners"".",2012-05-02 21:24:42

I was initially a bit skeptical about the price ($12 for 2 tacos and a side) but was very pleased with the amount of fish/meat in my meal. You are allowed to mix and match any taco on the menu, so I went with two of their specialty tacos - lemon grilled shrimp and honey soy glazed salmon. Out of the two, both were extremely flavorful and juicy, but the salmon was just cooked extremely well and the sauce was divine. I also enjoyed the semi crispy taco shells, that was a first. I think the sides could be improved, however. I got sautéed veggies as a side and they could do with a bit more flavor. But overall, a very satisfying meal. 

Service was slow-ish and our server didn't seem very interested at all but it was fine.

I'm anticipating the food being good, as it hasn't disappointed yet. However, the coffee was super weak. I sent it back and the waitress suggested an Americano instead, which is a good idea. Except it was even weaker than the coffee!!  Geez, O&B needs to get their coffee together. She recommended the spiced pear cider.  Bingo. Quite tasty. 

Ambience: It's sort of hard to describe. It's somewhat modern, somewhat old cabin-y. I like it. Though acoustically you can tell it's going to get LOUD when full. 

Food: Damn tasty. Ordered the Fried Bologna and Eggs, which is fried eggs with thin strips of Bologna cooked right in. Great potatoes, as well. Side of ""Nasty Sauce"" which is spicy and citrusy. 

Waitress was attentive and pleasant, not overly chatty. Would see her looking over to see if I needed anything, but not asking how I was every 3 minutes. So basically, perfect.

Recently I was introduced to Trader Joe's and this past weekend, I took my husband there for the first time. While I can't say I have fallen in love with grocery shopping, I have found that I can at least go to TJ's when need be.

The layout of the store is fabulous. It's just a big enough store to give you variety and some choices, but not big enough to overwhelm you, especially if you are not a seasoned grocery store veteran. The staff is very friendly and always willing to help you find something, and the check out clerks are chatty without being annoying. I really can't compare TJ's prices to those you would find at a regular big box grocery store, but according to my husband who does all of our grocery shopping and knows which stores are the best for certain items, he says that TJ's prices are comparable if not lower than other grocery stores.

I like the pre-packaged salads, sandwiches, and wraps, which are perfect to take to work for lunch. In fact, I had a TJ's chicken caesar wrap for lunch today and it was delicious! Do make sure to check the dates before purchasing to ensure that if you aren't going to eat it that day that it will last for a few more days. The organic pesto pizza that can be found in the frozen section is also very good and just the right size for two people. I was a little disappointed in the Red Delicious apples that I bought (nicely priced at 49 cents each)...they didn't have the crunch to them that I appreciate, but I'm not sure if it was the quality of their selection or that I just did a crappy job of picking two apples.

This TJ's does seem to be quite popular especially given it's location in the same shopping center as Changing Hands and Wildflower, so if you go on a Saturday, I would suggest going early. We arrived at 11 am and it was quite busy and the parking lot was almost full.",2008-12-09 21:13:47

There were 5 of us and we were starved. We ordered 4 apps! We got the pretzel with the cheese dip, it was pretty nom worthy.

Next up the food. A friend and I decided to split two items so we could taste test. I got the pulled pork sandwich and he got the burger with the caramelized onions. Both were great though I favor the burger over the pork.

Last night my friend and I were downtown and we were craving the lobster roll. She called Sushi 21 and asked for the hours for all you can eat.

The guy said we didn't call and that he's the only one who answered. Once she showed him the outgoing call in her phone, he changed his story. He didn't try to accommodate and wasn't polite about it at all. 

We ended up going up the street to another sushi spot. Sushi 21 lost out on the $70 that we paid for sushi and tip at the other location.

It was getting dark out and outside was not real bright with lights in the parking lot. It is not a store I would go to unless I had to and was kinda glad when we left. Seemed like some shady people hanging out near by the entrance.

The guy on the phone told me that I could and I arrived 5 minutes early. When I walked in and said I had an appointment at 1 the girl looked at me like she didn't know what was going on and didn't say anything so I was like do you want me to have a seat or what and she finally was like oh you can follow me. The color selections they had were horrible so I was going to settle for the most neutral thing I could find. The girl who sat me down tells me the guy doing a pedicure next to me will be with me shortly; he barely was just getting the clients feet out of the water but I sat and waited patiently. While waiting the client next to me had to repeatedly ask the guy to clean off the polish from her skin and finally she just said that she would do it on her own when she got home but he kept persisting that he do it which took even longer. You should not have to remind your nail technician repeatedly how to do your pedicure because they should already know how to. Once I looked at the time and realized it was almost 130 and the only thing that had been done was put alcohol on my toes and have them soak to take off the gel. I hadn't even put my feet in the water because I'm waiting for this guy. So I took the foil off that was soaking my toes and left. Not once was there an apology and not once did anyone tell me that I would be waiting forever. Do not book clients if you don't have the availability because it was a waste of my time.

Roasted piglet - juicy meat, crispy skin, but not the best I've ever had. I'd give it a 3.5/5.
Stir-fried snow peas, celery, scallop, conch - Conch was delicious. The rest of it was fairly standard.
Shark fin soup with crab meat - good amount of shark fin. Real crab meat. My gripe with this was that it had the strangest consistency. It was slimy (like snot). It did not drip. It was gooey. The broth was also quite bland.
Snow pea shoots with abalone and sea cucumber - abalone was tender. Snow pea shoots were fresh and delicious. They cooked the snow pea shoots in our room, so they were still super hot when they served them to us.
Crispy chicken - crispy skin, tender meat.
Lobster stir fried with maggi sauce - Typical.
I believe it was steamed bass, but I could have been mistaken - I'm not usually a big fan of steamed fish at restaurants (I prefer it at home), but this was delicious. 
E-fu noodles in broth with dumpling - I am not a fan of e-fu in broth. I like my e-fu braised or wok-fried. This was alright. Dumpling had a thin skin and a lot of shrimp and Chinese fungus in it. The filling was a tad chunky for me though.
Abalone fried rice - looks like yeung chow fried rice, but with what looks like bits of Chinese shiitake mushroom. Not mushroom. Abalone. Good amount of abalone. Tender abalone. Delicious fried rice.
Desserts - assorted cookies, peanut sweet soup with black bean glutinous rice dumplings. Peanut soup was not fragrant enough. It was also the same gooey, slimy texture as the shark fin soup. Cookies were not bad.

MUCH. BETTER.  my crawfish had a really funky taste to them.  On top of that, I thought the trifecta medium hot sauce was a little bland.  It definitely needed more salt and more heat.  so lesson learned, there IS a difference between frozen and live, and always order the live crawfish.  however, the ""frozen"" crawfish were a lot larger than the live crawfish.

One nice touch is that they give you free cheesecake if it's your bday!

I thought maybe there was another menu floating around but our server said nope that's the new menu now.  Oh and it looks like kids menu is gone too. I didnt see any kid friendly menu selections. Maybe you can request it.

What is cool is they are using more french traditional cooking techniques. What is not so cool, it all still tastes ""meh""  When I started eating my order of Pot Pie Nouveau (English translation Chicken Pot Pie) there was no chicken in it!  Thinking to myself, maybe I ordered the vegetarian version? No lie, I thought I was being Punk'd there for a minute.  It was then my server came up and asked ""is there chicken in there?"" Oops!  Staff apologized.  This new menu was just implemented this week.  They were all still getting used to the new procedures and forgot to add chicken. It's all good. I understand. I actually feel sorry for the employees though. They look and seemed to be awkward  with the whole French style but despite that, service was c'est magnifique!

Everything on their menu that I've tried I've loved. Whether it's the sugar, white chocolate macadamia nut or peanut butter cookies or their custard filled, fresh fruit topped, crumbly crust butter tarts; it's exactly what you'd expect of a great dessert; a treat full of well balanced flavor that leaves you satisfied without feeling too full.

Expect to pay a premium for these treats; but if you need to impress someone special, a Brûlée dessert is sure to do the trick. Just follow your nose down the stairs and get yourself a sugar cookie (you deserve it).

I know this before I take one bite of food, because their children are running in and out of the kitchen and around the customers' seating area playing tag and sounding like what I imagine a pack of rabid chimps might sound like. Only people completely unconcerned about where their next paycheck is coming from have the luxury of being as oblivious to their customers as this. The stories I've read on Yelp back me up on this - lines out the door? The food must be stunning.

Guy Fieri certainly seemed to think so, but then again, doesn't he always. Me, not so much. I got the taco/enchilada/tamale combo plate, and nothing on the plate was more complex or interesting than anything I could get at Taco Hell for half the price. The enchilada was bland and boring. The tamale was dry, but at least there was bottled taco sauce to put on it, how nice. The beans and rice tasted like... nothing. Wet porridge and dry porridge? Cutting edge stuff - if you live in a nursing home. 

The sole exception to this crap parade was the beef taco, which was extremely tasty. Too bad that even that was ruined by its size (just North of a silver dollar in circumference) and the fact that it had been unceremoniously dumped on top of the enchilada, rendering it too slippery to hold.

So if your idea of a great taco shack experience is eating two tablespoons of great taco meat with a fork surrounded by formica and fail, then you're in luck. For my part, I think I'll chalk this up as another Fieri fiasco. I doubt anyone at Los Taquitos will care - why should they? They've obviously got all the customers they need.",2010-01-13 01:20:34

I use to eat at Fatburgers ages ago because it was by my college campus, so convenience factor was there. But got converted once I discovered In-N-Out despite having to drive out to get it. Never looked back since. 

Funny thing happened, I was going to try LBS Burger so I asked the Fatburger employee where its at. Yup, I really did ask Fatburgers where I can find their competitor burger place is at. They didn't know.

Was at Red Rock waiting for the movie to start so just grabbed a bite here. For around $11 I got a really big burger and fries. I got a pretty good value based on the size of the burger and the fries, but flavor just didn't impress me. Much better than Fuddruckers. Fries were very good though with the clean and crispy flavor.

I felt that service could've been a bit better as every table looked like they've been waiting to be serviced for a while. Although they were under staffed they still accommodated to my needs of ordering sake bombs (a pitcher of sapporo+sake), I guess it's not a common order since the waiter didn't know what I was asking for so I had to explain it to them. 

Here's a little 411 on sake bomb
Beer+sake= sake bomb (Asian style of a jagger bomb) fill the beer Mug halfway, make sure the sake cup is filled up and slightly held up by the chopsticks. I think there might be a chant before you slam the table but wishing your friend happy birthday is good enough and at the same time everyone slams the table so that the shot drops in like a bomb ... Literally a mess so make sure you have tons of napkins. Important part of this is that everyone chugs it to the last drop!! (please drink responsibly )

He says he likes when someone comes in and challenges him with an order. 

Where can you get that in Charlotte/Matthews/Mint Hill area?! As for catering they do it all even six foot subs. The pizza is really, REALLY good. If you give him at least two weeks notice (more I think for Mozzarella) he can MAKE home made Cavatelli, Gnocchi, Mozzarella. I was like, ""WHAT!? How did we all not know this?!"" 

So...please, the food and service is amazing already but to make home made pasta and mootz - you can't beat it!  He enjoys fresh ingredients, I loved their version of Cavatelli as it is healthier than the one I grew up with that was buried with butter lol! But they can make it that way too. I love the idea of chopped mozzarella over the top - which is when he said they can make it home made. 

Oh, and I had the Limoncella Marscapone Cake tonight as a 'sample' --- holy cow, AMAZING. They hope to eventually be able to make their own pastries/cakes but this one is to die for.

Located in a strip mall across from the Chapters, there is ample parking in front of the restaurant. I was confused by the exterior and almost thought it was take out and delivery only, but there are multiple chairs and tables inside if you wish to stay. There were only one table other than us, but the kitchen seemed extremely busy regardless, so I assume most people visit this place for take out and delivery. 

We were famished so we got one rice dish, garlic nan, and two curry dishes. We were worried it wouldn't be enough, but curry always seems to fill me more than I expect. 

I was sad that they didn't have anything similar to a coconut rice dish here so I opted for the egg rice which was basically a egg scrambled in rice. Surprisingly really good with curry!

I also got the mango lassi and really enjoyed it. It was good but I wish it was served colder. 

Our bill was only 35$ (inc. tip) which was not bad at all for the amount of food we got (plus a drink!). Usually for the amount of food we got, at other places we easily pay over 50$.

If you live in the area and they deliver, I would definitely give this place a try. Can't comment on the service for delivery but when we dined in, they were very pleasant.

My personal favourite is their rusty pelican (nutella ice cream, chocolate sauce, and nuts) mmmm I want one now!
 
I've also had their sundaes which are HUGE too and also quite decadent. I believe they make their ice cream in house and they do have some intriguing flavours (my favourite is the nutella; I'm dying to go back and try the peanut butter). With their sundaes and crepes you can choose a pre-set combination or design your own. All their desserts will run you around $8-10 dollars and are well worth it as they are delicious and quite large. 

This particular location has a pretty large patio, and is quite bright and clean on the inside. You cannot beat the location (404 and 7), and this is a great place to go after dinner or simply if you are craving something sinfully sweet. Service has always been good at this location and I will definitely keep coming back!",2012-09-11 20:35:35

I came here with a large student group of about 50 ppl and we reserved the upstairs space. There was some confusion about how they would like us to order and in the end we decided it was simplest for each of us to order downstairs and pay. My friend and I split a peach soju, a pineapple soju, and a pork belly dukkbokki. Food here is a great deal. Super large portions for a super low price. Is the quality of food exceptional though? No, you just get what you pay for which is quantity not quality. The peach soju though was fantastic, and I would definitely re order it on another visit if the chance arises.

So where I'm conflicted with the rating was the service. At first I was super impressed with the female wait staff who were super polite and helpful in spite of the difficulties of catering to a large group. Where I was tempted to 2 star this place is the behaviour of one of the male staff. It was a social and we booked the entire upper space. But it was a friday so they sent some tables upstairs as well. That's fine, I get it, you need to make money. But since it was a social event people were standing up and speaking with each other, and while the male staff was trying to navigate through the crowd I actually saw him pushing people out of his way instead of just politely asking. I don't think that can be justified even in light of the crowded and stressful situation of the evening. However after much contemplation I think the female waitstaff definitely did enough to compensate for that and again, I also do understand that we were a difficult group. So in the end, I think my 3 star rating is a fair reflection of my experience.",2015-11-07 01:58:28

I've been in arizona for 4 years and this happens to be the most unprofessional school I've had to deal with. Never, have I witnessed such a lack of work ethic in a higher education facility. I'm not even sure I want to attend EMCC anymore, for the simple fact that I've spent months trying to get prepared for school, when they may not award me at all. Why should I have to call every week to make sure you're doing your job? I see no justification in that whatsoever. I have my own job to do, so I'd expect them to do their job, not laugh and giggle on the phone because you're not used to the technology. Isn't that the reason you're working at the school?

C'mon, it's pink. It's got ice cream inside. It's retro. Everything here screams ""this place is Tubular, Hip, Rad, Cool, Tight, Phat"" So whats the deal?
 First off, I was under the impression they had homemade ice cream. They don't. It's Dreyers. With canned whipped toppings, canned cherries, canned sauces.....nothing here is unique!  Aha, besides the decor! I blew through 1500 calories + for garbage. I was very dissapointed. So let me get on to the dish I had. I ate half of ""The Top Hat"". Described as a creampuff stuffed with rich vanilla ice cream and covered with hot chocolate. Sounds good doesn't it? The cream puff shell which should be light and fluffy with a ""slight"" pull was extremely tough, flavorless, dry and I am assuming old! How can they even call it a cream puff when the best part (the cream) is non existent? So my dry ball was filled with Dreyers ice cream. Not good. 
 We actually ate lunch first. They have an ""American"" menu. Egg Salad, BLT, Burgers, Tuna, Grilled Cheese etc.... . The problem is nothing was good. I ordered a patty melt. The burger was tasteless and very, very  small. Id say about the size patty you would find on a Mcdonalds Kids Cheeseburger. The Kicker....No fries. No Fries? What the Fuck? Chips?Stick these chips in some ice cream and get creative. Daughter had a BLT, two strips, yes, two strips of bacon on wonder bread. Coleslaw was the WORST I HAVE EVER HAD! This place just sucks. Huge upset for a place I was really looking forward to. I try to review the food as much as possible but I have to say this about the service. SSLLOOWW!

The wine barrels are made into tables and you can find corks just about anywhere, even in the artwork on the walls, making the place scream winery like none other! There were also castle like chairs toward the back right corner of the bottom floor, which gave, yet another feeling of the eccentric atmosphere, leaving no detail out of their design layout!

I really thought that it was the perfect blend! The Merlot, Petite Sirah and Red Blend were pretty dry. I'm not a wine connoisseur but I really couldn't taste the difference between the three, though for being dry wines, they were very smooth. The sauvignon Blanc was good, though I couldn't taste the citrus undertones. The prices are $20-$39/bottle, though the bottle that is $39 is totally worth it- it is the Malbec.

I have had both the European and Asian style sandwiches. I prefer the Asian because of the tangy crunchy pickled vegetables. I switch between the shredded and BBQ pork. The BBQ can get a little sweet but it is good. The peppers are nice and spicy. Sometimes they are a little heavy on the cilantro for me, but I just pick some off. I also love that these sandwiches are not covered in goopy mayo. One good sized sandwich is only $2.85. That fits almost any budget. The store is very clean, although it can be a bit noisy. I normally get my sandwiches to go. 
The ice cream is available in many flavors. I personally like it, but I know some people who don't.

If you're a regular use to Izakayas, you wouldn't mind the noise level...I personally love the way vibe and atmosphere becuz it's more unique..=D

It was quite full on a Friday night, as expected, and we arrived closer to 10ish so alot of the items we wanted were already sold out...BOOO...

We just ordered practically almost every item on the menu except for the ones being sold out...the thing with eating at Izakayas is that all of the dishes come out so small and if you are looking to fill yourself up...be prepared to break your bank..I don't think this is a place where you want to eat until you're stuffed...not a guud idea...

I've only been here twice with the first time being two years ago. Everything seemed to be fine then, but having visited recently I doubt I would ever want to return. 

I came with a group of approximately 13 people. We originally planned to eat from their set lunch menu (which was on their website), but was told that we could only have AYCE lunch. Since the group was mostly here at this point, we decided to just eat AYCE. We had to order multiple times in order to get our food and even then they either came in the wrong portions or not at all. The fish was cold, but the rice was warm which made a strange lukewarm combination for the sushi. Food for the most part was just average for an AYCE place. 

At around 2:30, we sent in two orders since it was the last call before they closed for lunch. We only received our desserts, but not the order previous. We ended up speaking to a lady who told us that she would get our food shortly (they either forgot or weren't planning on giving it to us - probably the latter), and then it all started coming in. It would have been nice if the food had come before our dessert as most of us were pretty much full at this point. Our bill was given together and not split as we had requested. 

With all the mishaps that happened during the meal, I am highly disappointed in the decrease of quality of this restaurant. I don't plan on returning.",2016-03-19 09:11:03

Just really wanted some.

Since my friend lives near this sushi restaurant, and we were at the Starbucks just down the street.  I got a salmon sushi pizza to go.  I decided to call them, and they told me to pick it up in 10 minutes.

Was not very impressed.  1) the salmon was not that fresh; 2) the description was: salmon, spicy sauce, onion, green onion, unagi sauce (what onion and green onions?! I didn't see it!); and 3) the salmon was strangely warm by the time I got it.

1) Portion - gigantic is the right description.  We ordered a Manchurian Beef Noodle ($8) for take out.  It filled 2 boxes.  My BF and I could only finish 1 of the 2 boxes together.

2) Price - Very affordable.  $8 for a Manchurian Beef/Chicken Noodle.  $9 for a Chicken Pakora.  There were about 15 pieces of pakora (see picture).  Each piece was the size of a golf ball.  Lunch special is $6 per item, available Monday to Friday.

3) Services - The waitress was fast, effective and friendly.  She gave us extra napkins per request.  Like 4 extra thick napkins.  It was pretty generous.  

4) Cleanliness - the exterior of the store looked divey.  The interior looked nothing special.  The washroom (ladies) was, surprise surprise, very clean and tidy.  Yes, the bathroom amenities were no frills and basic, but it was CLEAN as in no dust, no spot or mark, no mess on floor.  I won't say completely dust free, but it beat the cleanliness level of many expensive restaurants.  And there was hot water, hand soap, paper towels.  I was impressed.  Someone cared about washroom here.

5) Food - I am no authority of Indian Chinese food.  Did the food taste the way it was supposed to taste like?  No clue.  I could tell you everything tasted bold. There were strong spices flavours.  The pakoras were delicious.  The noodle was average: mostly noodle, little beef, orange in colour.  The noodle was noted as non-spicy on menu.  It was actually mildly spicy.  Food was made to order.  It came out of kitchen piping hot.  

The food rating is 3 stars in truth.  I round it up to 4 stars, because the first 4 aspects are not just good, but extremely strong.",2017-05-14 03:28:50

I'm a bit put off as their espresso shot was a bit ""too bright"".. perhaps it a little too soon for their espresso beans from Social Coffee Co to be used, but they're new so I'll cut them some slack.

The space is nice, but a little too small for my tastes.  I usually like to lazily sit around, reading a book or chatting up the baristas getting to know their philosophy about coffee and how they got into it.

- Latte Tea
Oolong Latte: a mix of smoky, bitter, and sweet that has you begging for another sip. I was very intrigued by the flavors. You also get to watch your tea steep for a couple minutes to get the strong flavors. It takes about 5-10 minutes for this one, but a little extra love goes a long way. 

- Milk Tea 
So many many to choose from! All look familiar except Hokkaido and Okinawa. If you're looking for something creamier, go Hokkaido. Want a bolder tea taste? Get Okinawa. My personal favorite is the Okinawa because you can still taste the tea after mixing it with milk. 

The service is impeccable too. You can ask for your drink with any amount of sweetness and ice before AND AFTER getting your drink. So far everything's been spot on for me, no adjustments necessary! But it's nice to know they'd go out of their way to make the perfect drink for you.

s55RMJWnHU0-RhqUzwyQdA,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,OzcVyb1JudLFjZ9lfGSN3w,5,3,2,4,"Alright so this review is gonna be a challenge to keep within Yelp's typed character limit, but here goes.  In short, this is hands down, without a doubt, beyond debate, emphatically, undeniably the greatest culinary festival I have ever attended in the state of Arizona.  And that's saying something as someone who does culinary festivals quite frequently.  In my humble opinion, Devour is better than the Scottsdale Culinary Festival, better than Phoenix Cooks, better than all of them.  I'll get into the reasons why in a moment, but foodies who have not attended Devour before are going to want to save up their nickels & put this on their culinary bucket list.  Alright, I've built up this much hype so let's get to the details.

Devour is the brainchild of valley wonder woman Kimber Lanning & Local First Arizona, the organization which she founded and that has been putting on great local events statewide for years.  While Local First puts on events every year that draw large crowds (Local First Arizona Fall Festival, World Bazaar Market, & Savor Southern Arizona to name a few), this is arguably their biggest event of the year both in terms of expense & in terms of demand.  The Devour Festival is actually a week long celebration with events such as a bartender competition, an event that showcases art mixed with culinary art, a culinary film showing, & even a plated dinner fundraiser.  But the main event is the Culinary Classic.  The Classic is the ultimate culinary showcase of Arizona based chefs, restaurants, breweries, wineries, food trucks, & all culinary things in between.  Basically a two day orgy of all you can eat & drink with at least 50 different unique vendors to try each day.  So you could go on Saturday alone, but you'll miss out on a completely different lineup of vendors on Sunday.  Hence the reason I bought a two day ticket for this year's Classic.

I have the great fortune of knowing Devour event volunteer (& fellow Yelper) Natalie G who very kindly offered to show me the reigns during my first ever trip to this event.  The event itself takes up a sizable portion of the Phoenix Art Museum with beer, wine & liquor vendors stretching from the entrance to the museum all the way to the Great Hall where booze vendors mix with a number of dessert vendors.  In fact they even provide you with a wine glass & a wine glass lanyard to keep your hands free for all that food.  There are also cooking demos in one of the auditoriums, & a cocktail lounge inside the Palette restaurant if you've paid for a VIP ticket to the event.  But the main action is in the Dorrance Sculpture Garden (basically the main interior courtyard of the museum).  There you'll have the bulk of the valley's chefs whipping up any number of tapas style dishes for your consumption.  And as I mentioned everything here is all you can eat & drink as its all paid for with your admission.

To my great surprise, most of the food vendors weren't just serving one item for everyone, but often 2 or 3 or more different items for you to try.  And despite a packed event, the food vendors mostly do a great job keeping the food coming so that lines don't get too long & people can easily move on from one food tent to the next.  The food offerings were also surprisingly not just what you'd see offered at their restaurants on a daily basis, but also special food items that are exclusive to the Devour Classic.  With so many vendors here, its probably good to have a plan of attack before you arrive, or you'll get full too quickly.  I'd advise doing a quick walk around to look at each tent, see what they're serving, and figure out which looks best to you.  My plan was to try and have at least one dish from every food tent so I mostly steered clear of the booze and carried a bottled water with me.  Turned out to be a good strategy as I was successfully able to try at least one dish from each food vendor both days.

And yes, this event is expensive.  Tickets for the Classic in 2017 were $112 per person per day for regular admission.  If you wanted VIP admission I believe the price was at least $150.  So for both days of the Classic, I paid $225 this year.  The other thing is you need to buy your tickets for this event months in advance.  The general admission tickets for both Saturday & Sunday sold out two months in advance this year.  And VIP tickets sold out three months in advance.  So you've got to commit a lot & you've got to commit early.  But was it worth it?  Well considering I had food from Crudo, Cibo, Clever Koi, Fox Restaurants, Lon's, Barrio Cafe, St Francis, T Cooks, House of Tricks, Different Pointe of View, Citizen Public House, Upward Projects, Virtu, Beckett's Table, the Parlor, Bitter & Twisted, & dozens upon dozens of others....yeah, I'd say so.

Foodies, make this event a priority.  There's simply no other event that compares.  Its worth every penny & will leave you explosively full of joy.  Now excuse me while I rest off this epic food coma",2017-03-05 21:45:44

Been here twice now, and I can certainly say that this place is an underrated gem in Markham.

Le Modern is located on the ground floor of an office building, and has been open for about a year now. The inside is indicative of the new style Japanese restaurants (think JaBistro, Kinka, etc), but this place is a lot quieter than the well known establishments downtown.

The menu isn't very extensive, but the options are quite decent for a Japanese restaurant. The servers are Chinese, but the head chef in the kitchen is Japanese, so you know this place is authentic.

Some items I tried include the okonomiyaki, sashimi platter, angel roll, salmon oshizushi, tako wasabi, le hokkaido salad, grilled squid, miso black cod, lobster fantasy roll, and beef/pork skewers. Out of these, I highly recommend all the items except the okonomiyaki and beef skewers. The tako wasabi is extremely spicy as the wasabi stems in this dish is legit. The sashimi platter has decent variety, including bluefin tuna. Their pork skewers are also some of the juiciest I've ever tried.

This place also does catering for large parties, and I recently booked a 14 person party as part of my relatives from Hong Kong visiting the country. Their service is very good in terms of making sure everyone's appetites are satisfied.

Service is excellent, and personally I would rather visit Le Modern than similar restaurants in the area such as Tsuki.",2016-05-20 21:25:35

We ordered an order of garlic cheese bread and a pizza. We couldn't decide between the lasagna pizza or the farm house pizza so I told the waiter to choose one and not tell us until it arrived. This was actually a really fun way to get dinner for the night and the waiter even enjoyed it.

Our garlic bread came. It was great! It wasn't the normal hot dog bun bread you get from your local pizza eatery. It was smothered in cheese and had great flavors. 

When our pizza finally came, the anticipation had reached its peak. We received the farm house pizza! Great choice. The waiter said it was the chef's own creation so that's why he chose it. It was wonderful. We even took some home with us!!

Half the square footage is like outdoor furniture stuff or something and I always see people messing around over there so it must be good. For my two cents, I like that the important stuff is all together. Produce, butcher, dairy isn't spread all over the place like most stores. Also, the staff has always been helpful to me so kudos for that. 

I'll be keeping an eye on this Fry's for sure.",2015-01-05 17:44:23

 If you are looking for a chocolate experience, you have come to the right place.

Ambrosia means food of the gods, theobroma (the genus which the cocoa tree belongs) means food of the gods. there's a ton of goodies here fit for the Almighty.

First of all, Gail Ambrosius (the human) is a lovely lady. She is very kind and extremely knowledgeable about her craft and product.

Secondly, each chocolate has been perfected, and highlights the chocolate's character and/or origin and other ingredients wonderfully. 

The chocolates are grouped into categories or collections based on the experience you are looking for. This makes picking out chocolates a tiny bit easier.
Example: adventurous, classic, tea inspired, etc

The chocolates are a little spendy (about $2 per chocolate), but it's about quality not quantity.

Lemon grass with ginger
Machu Picchu
Sweet curry with saffron",2016-01-18 21:17:48

Located in the corner of the shopping center, Chopstix looks like your normal Chinese take out spot with advertisements of lunch specials plastered all over the windows. 

When I walked in, there was no one in there. In fact, it looked like the cooks and the cashier were having dinner on one of the tables. I felt bad when they all jumped up from the table to take my order. They have a variety of dishes on their menu, but I settled on the combination plate. For $7 and some change, the combination gets you an entree of your choice (there is a list of about 10 different dishes), chicken fried rice and a veggie egg roll. In about 10 minutes my food was ready to go! I like that. 

Since my first visit last week, I have already stopped by THREE times! It is probably not a healthy habit, but it is better than binging on Del Taco next door. I have ordered the mongolian beef, shrimp with lobster sauce, sesame chicken and general tso chicken. The general tso chicken was probably the tastiest and it will definitely be my go to choice. As far as portions go, Chopstix is fairly generous and I can usually have left overs for lunch the next day.

They don't take reservations unless you are a very large party, so if you don't want to wait go early.

If you are taking an older person they will be frustrated by the volume level. I didn't give a whoa, and kind of like that frantic-people talking-over-music thing, especially in Italian joints. BUT, guaranteed if you bring your mom or dad (or other person over 55) they will comment on the noise. 

You order the sides separately AND they have pasta starters. Double win.

The big meatball starter isn't the greatest, but it's worth it because it's fun to have around. I recommend the Osso Bucco, and their pastas WITHOUT Tomato Sauce.

i have been here a couple times, once for an event run by The Stop Community Food Centre who leases a large portion of the Barns and the other time has been for a little party.

what has captivated me about this space, is the space itself.  it houses an enormous green house that is run by The Stop, which is home to a vast array of common and uncommon vegetables and fruits in various stages of growth from seedlings to towering stalks.  it is lovely to get some sense of what the early stages of life are like for foods we commonly eat; in fact, most often youd never recognize what the plant was if not for it being labelled.

more importantly, all this food is used by The Stop for community education and charitable events.  There are also sections where school children have their own growing experiments.  i think in a world where most people never give thought to the source of our food,  and especially so in an urban environment, this is a welcome facility and endeavour.

as far as the grounds itself, there is a large playground for children, housed in former barns and factory buildings and it appears to be a lovely, familial environment that that community is lucky to have.",2009-10-18 20:44:26

It was late, maybe 1:30 and they weren't busy at all on a Saturday.  We were quickly seated and given menus along with iced barley tea and boiled peanuts.  We eagerly fell on the peanuts while perusing their menu.

So............I hate to do this to a joint that's so highly rated and with such friendly people but..............

My food came after an appropriate wait, not too long but not particularly quickly either, oxtail soup and spam musubi.  Hubby graciously persuaded me to start eating so I dug in while he snacked on the ban chan and peanuts and tasted my food.  No mac salad, no cold noodles.

After another while longer, we noted two, three other tables seated well after us getting all their food and chowing down together.  We gave it a few more minutes because maybe different kitchen zones were less busy than others.  Finally, we had to flag someone down.  The guy said he would go check on our order.

This part is what peeves me:  I know the temptation to cover up is great.  But I really don't like it when people don't come clean.  Apologize and tell me you forgot the order and I'll most likely forgive you because you were honest.   But don't tell me ""Your order will be out shortly, it just takes a little while.""  A few minutes later, I see through the window, the cook transferring dark noodles from point A to point B.  They plain forgot about the cold noodles AND the mac salad!  They didn't even acknowledge the mac salad after we got the cold noodles.  We gave them another few minutes and then just had them cancel it and they were like ""Ok.""

The food is good and the people are nice which is why I'm still giving them three stars.  But it wasn't busy and there was no reason that not even the mac salad was a no-show. No regrets but probably will try other places next time.",2016-05-19 19:08:25

This is the place to go if you want cheap delicious food! I always get the jerk chicken on a coco bun with a spicy beef patty on the side. The coco bun is always soft and tastes fresh and the jerk chicken is flavourful. It comes with coleslaw inside the sandwich as well, which adds some nice crunch. The spicy beef patty doesn't taste spicy at first but the spice will creep up on you the more you eat! So make sure you have some water or juice on hand to wash the spice down. Both those items cost me about $5!! There are also rice options as well if you're feeling like you need a bit more sustenance. 

Parking can easily be found in the lot outside.

We went on a Friday evening, about 8:30pm and grabbed a table.  After staring at the wall of beers on tap and feeling a bit overwhelmed, I asked our waitress about a few that I'd never seen (namely Goose Island's Ten Hills), to which she replied ""I really don't know anything about that beer"".  No biggie, so I tried another, same response,  Usually at a bar in Wisconsin, they generously offer a sample to you...not her.  Just stared blank faced...awesome start!  So I asked for a sample of the Goose Island, which she brought.  I liked it and ordered a full size glass....which came and was not even the same beer.  Luckily I still had the sampler at the table, which was a slightly cloudy pale ale, and my new beer was a rich toned amber.  She insisted they were the same...again, ridiculous from a beer bar.

My husband, being a dark beer lover, ordered an oatmeal stout.  The glass came and was literally over 50% foam....the worst beer pour ever, none the less from a ""brews"" bars.  Laughable, he took it up to the bar and the other waitress shook her head (clearly realizing the issue) and poured him a new one.  He re-ordered the same beer and again, a cup-o-foam was brought to the table.

I thought the slots were much tighter than average, but hey, someone has to pay for that decor inside (then again, I've done much better at the Cosmopolitan and the Eastside Cannery is nowhere near the level of the Cosmo).  The biggest disappointment was the bait and switch on tickets to a recent MMA event.  I wanted best available, and she circled on a map where they would be.  Looked good so I bought the tickets.  The seats and location noted on the tickets are not on the map of the arena.  When I brought it to the attention to the clerk who sold me the tickets, she kept looking on her screen telling me the section (yes, it says so on my tickets, my point is I don't know where in the arena these seats are as the floor plan doesn't show the section or seat on my ticket) she went back and talked to the manager (I think her name may have been Heidi) , came back and circled where I would be, which was different than where she initially said I'd be, worse seats (after I paid of course).  When I complained, she offered a refund but I already promised fight tickets to friends.  The night of the event, the seats are even worse than the other worse seats she told me they would be in.  2nd to the last row.  Another word of note, there were 2 additional people with us that were just going to buy tickets that night.  They were told there were only $100 seats left (ours were $33) so they opted to gamble and have dinner instead.  While we were inside, the entire last row behind us was empty (how are those seats $100 and ours were $33?), and not only that, but there were large patches of empty seats in the arena available that were better than ours (remember, I wanted best available and they gave me garbage seats).  So bottom line, they sell tickets to an event with a floor plan that is either outdated or for another arena altogether, and they tell you you're sitting in a certain area when in fact, you will be way in the back.

I generally don't drink martinis, but when I go to the Martini I always have a couple. The tini menu is so extensive that nearly everyone will find something that is to their taste. My favorites to date are the pomegranate and the Blue Martini. The pomegranate is pretty straight forward with the exception of the splash of grapefruit vodka they use. This gives it a bit of a citrusy edge that works well with the sweetness of the pomegranate. The Blue Martini is also a great blend of sweet and tart with OJ and sour mix paired with Blue Curacao and Cointreau.  The Lemon Drop, Cosmo and Three Chocolates are also very good.  
  We've never eaten at The Martini so I can't speak to the quality of their food. This is usual the starting spot for a mini pub crawl around Town Square (we save the eating for Cadillac Ranch or Yardhouse). 
  The Blue Martini is a great meeting spot and an excellent choice for Happy Hour. The ladies need to be sure to get a Blue Martini card, which gets you a free martini on each visit. Some folks may get a bit of sticker shock when they see the martini prices, but rest assured its money well spent. Your drink comes in an oversized shaker that holds the equivalent of two big drinks. As the more popular places in Vegas go, it's a pretty good deal.

The Good Foot Spa is like the hole in the wall authentic chinese restaraunt that you love going to after 12am kinda' Massage Parlor!  Sure, they use paper napkin cut-outs for your face, they do talk on the phone while they service you and you do get lost in translation every so often, but so does your fave after 12am chinese restaurant!  

They start you off with tea and crackers, then they soak your feet in a bath of hot tea water.  You get your choice of a full back massage or foot massage or a mix of the two.  Whatever you choose off the menu, your masseuse will begin with a 10min facial and ""ear"" (to the fellas who like ear rubs) massage appetizer.. made my leg twitch.  I specifically requested for a female masseuse.  I expected a very ""finesse don't wanna break my finger nail"" kinda massage, but man she was worth every penny!  Her rub down was relaxing where it was necessary and bone breaking where it was needed.  I even dozed off for a quick minute sometime in between the two.  She even climbed on my back on all fours to make sure she delivered the right amount of pressure.. talk about ""full body"".. made my toes curl.  To my suprise during the middle of the massage while she held my hand, she muttered, ""Tek it off"".  I made her repeat herself to make sure i heard correctly and again she muttered, ""Tek off you watch""... got it!

In conclusion, it was cheap and it did the job.  If this place made my toes curl, made my leg twitch, and was told to ""tek it off"", it definitely was a ""Happy Ending""!

byZVkzUOZLk9pS7nGWcF9g,oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog,3,3,2,3,"One of my friends told me about Mian Sichuan Noodles. It was brand spanking new and how could I resist trying out a new spot? A NOODLE spot at that! I love some good noodles!

Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch with my fiance and my best friend. We were lucky enough to find a spot the moment we got to the plaza and were seated right away. 

My fiance went with their spicy beef noodles. My best friend went with their hot and sour noodles. As for me, I went with their spicy pig intestine noodles. For every bowl of noodles, you have the option of adding extra items to it such as an egg, more meat, etc. Extra noodles are free of charge so if you're a big eater or you just want a giant serving, go ahead and get a serving of free noodles! All the extras that you get on the side literally comes on the side. They don't put it in your bowl of noodles. They serve it to you in an individual bowl unless you get a fried egg. If you get extra noodles, extra beef, side of something else .. you will have a total of four bowls. 

My bowl of noodles definitely had a good amount of kick. It was spicy but it's a different kind of spicy than most people are used to. They use the numbing spice. This type of spicy is quite famous in the Sichuan region. In Chinese, we refer it to ""mala"" which is pretty much translated to ""numbing spicy"" .. the herbs that they use will numb your tongue. It's a completely different feeling from having ghost pepper. So if you like this type of spicy then go for it. If you don't then don't get it because you won't like it. 

Other than the numbing spice, the bowl of noodles was definitely a burst of flavor. My bowl was actually a different base than my fiance's. His had less spice and more of a beefy flavor. I also enjoyed the pig intestines quite a bit. They were flavorful and fatty. 

They also give you a decent amount of noodles in your bowl. I actually didn't finish my bowl of noodles because I got so full. 

You also get a green bean/mung bean drink with your meal. It is slightly sweet and refreshing. The servers come around asking if you want a refill on that too, which is nice. You might have to tell them to speak English though. 

So why three stars? The location of this establishment is horrid. I hate the plaza that it's in. It gets really busy there due to Tea Station and Ichiza so finding parking can be a nightmare, especially during dinner time. Honestly, I don't think I would come again if I had to deal with that nightmare. I would probably only come in random odd hours where the parking won't be annoyingly stupid. 

The service, as someone else has mentioned, is quite lackluster. There will be times where they're constantly walking around and making sure you're okay but then there are times where none of them are there. Making eye contact is especially hard because it seems they're trying to avoid you. When you say ""excuse me"" you have to say it loud or they ignore you. I got ignored twice. Despite that, they are all very polite and nice. 

Overall, it is decent. It's just not the type of spicy flavors that I prefer. I don't like the numbing effect of the spice. I wouldn't mind trying it again though.",2017-08-30 07:34:22

My turkey burger with sweet potato fries was amazing, from what I noticed of my friend's parents they liked their meals. My friend had the romaine salad with chicken.

We started with a board of 4 house-cured meats and one cheese.  Very good.  Had I known one of the cuts was going to be pure fat, I think I would've substituted that one for something leaner.  Very good nonetheless.  Pickled accompaniments were a nice addition.

As our other appetizer, we had the cervello.  These were two small rolls.  The filling was lamb brains, wrapped in deep fried meat (prociutto?).  Some people may have already thrown up a bit in their mouths reading ""lamb brains"" or any brains for that matter, but man, this was delicious!  I could've eaten another order (of two) myself.

Duck pasta was really good.  The portion looks small but after eating half, you realize the ragout is quite heavy and filling.  

We also shared the red (tomato sauce) pizza with burrata and truffles.  This pizza was amazing!  The crust was perfection.  

For dessert, we shared a tiramisu.  I'm not a dessert person so it was just ok to me.

Service was very good throughout the evening.  However, we just had to wait a little longer for dessert and then we had to wait even longer to get the bill.  

One thing that bothered us was the temperature in the restaurant.  There was a bit of a draft making it kind of cool, and as a result, our food got cold really fast.  I'm sure it's hard to regulate the thermostat in a converted warehouse-type structure, especially when it's in the basement too.  

All in all, it was a lovely meal for my anniversary.  I would still recommend this place even with the few minor setbacks.",2013-10-07 00:55:38

Well, it did take a while for them to be ready...to the point that most people might have started getting mad.  But, here's why I was impressed:

#1.  I have no idea who the manager was.  Everyone was on their game to get it done and you could tell that they genuinely cared.

#2.  While I was waiting, they apologized and I knew they meant it.  Two of them asked how my day was.

#3.  I was offered a cup to get something to drink while I waited (I hadn't ordered a drink).

#4.  When I left, he said:  ""I'd like to offer you a coupon for the next time you come in.  Since you had to wait as long as you did.""  It was an unexpected but nice touch.

Their menu is extensive and we've liked everything we've tried so far.

After I stopped eating chicken, I could still get my curry fix with the curry shrimp w/ bread (235) and they have quite a few vegetarian options as well, including the vegetarian spring rolls & vermicelli (908). Portions on all of their dishes are also very generous and give great bang for your buck.

I called to make an appointment and informed the person on the phone that I was coming in to use the last massage on my package.  When I showed up to check in, the check in was quick and easy, ""Oh yes, you're all set"".  I sat down to check my messages and email in the phone and to turn the phone to vibrate in consideration of other customers.  I had Lodema for my massage therapist and she was very good.  My trapezoids were very tight and so she worked on them quite a bit and got them to release.  I highly recommend her as a massuese.  

HOWEVER, the drama all began with the checkout.  That's when they tell me I don't have another massage left on my package.  I told the receptionist that if that was the case, I should have been informed at the time of check in so I would have the opportunity to make an informed choice about whether or not to incur the services/expense.  She gets Julie on the phone (not sure of her title) and she tells me that what she can do for me is to sell me another package or membership but that she cannot honor the remaining massage I had left on my package because it had expired.  I asked her why then was I not informed so I would have the choice at check in.  She told me she had left me a message on my phone.  Later I saw she did leave a message but only after I had checked in and turned my phone off, so I didn't get any message in a timely manner in order to make an informed decision.

Here's another thing:  I called to make an appointment a few months ago to use that remaining massage I had on my package.  I called in to make the appointment for the following day, again telling them I had a massage left.  I woke up sick the day of the appointment and so I called to tell them I could not make it.  Because it was less than 24 hour notice, they charged me a $20 cancellation fee.  So if I did not have a massage on my package, I wouldn't have made the appointment and I wouldn't have incurred the $20 cancellation fee.

EDITED REVIEW:  I have edited my review from a one star to a four star.  Deanna, the owner called me about my yelp review and was truly interested in seeing what she could do to make things right.  She was very professional and understanding and offered me to come back for a complimentary massage.  I booked with Lodema again and got another wonderful massage.  I realized I needed more time working on my neck.  So, because the owner worked with me, I gave this studio another shot and even purchased a 3 month package.  Thank you Lodema for another wonderful massage and thank you Deanna for working to resolve my initial frustration with the check out procedure.  I am looking forward to going back.",2013-03-20 23:01:08

This place wasn't too busy for dinner, but the wait for food took a while. I had asked for brown gravy instead of country gravy, but the order came out with country gravy and had to be returned to the kitchen.

Now let me say that the wait was a little long for the whole meal, and normally that plus the order mistake would make for a negative review. However, the food was amazing - like I said, best Chicken Fried Steak I've ever had, and creamy Mashed Potatoes. An excellent meal.

On top of this, Jarrett was a great server; this caliber of service is so greatly appreciated in Vegas! He was polite, checked on the table repeatedly, apologized for the delays and errors, and sincerely did everything he could for a terrific dining experience.

a.  Ambiance - For this ""east"" part of town, very nice. Clean, good flow and organization. At 4:30 on Friday, it was 75% full.  A great testament either to fast food or good quality.

b.  Service - I really like the consistency and the good service from the people cooking, the cashier, the people prepping your order. High quality in my book.

c.  Food - They do a few things and do it very well. Fresh made chicken tenders, fries, texas toast.  I find the tenders to be awesome for a breaded fried product that I normally stay away from.  The toast is great. The fries, no go.

d.  Price - Can be reasonable. I spent 85.00 ordering a tray of 75 chicken tenders, served in 3 tin foil trays and 1 tray with fries. Very reasonable and a lot for the money.

We ordered a Café Latte and a Double Cappuccino with a Vanilla-Ricotta Croissant and Vanilla-Almond Biscotti.

I will not call myself a coffee connoisseur but everybody knows what they like.  The coffee at Balzac's didn't strike me as particularly superior to coffees I've had at other places.  The cappuccino was okay.  The latte was better, but it wasn't hot enough.  The croissant was soggy and the biscotti was stale.

vI2LBYeNVVpniF3AM3Sqvg,8Aj0YKThtXkSuauONIzYfQ,lpQziF9QCVZQRkxac1xzcw,5,6,5,4,"I had been anticipating the opening of Bonus Round after hearing that a new ""barcade"" was in the works in the midtown Phoenix area. After all, nothing goes together better than drinking and video games! I decided to wait a few weeks to let the initial hype die down so I could fully appreciate the experience, and I have to say, IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT! Last night I made my first appearance and felt right at home when I walked in. 

The interior has a very raw but welcoming feel with classic arcade games scattered about, and handwritten menus/drink lists on chalkboards hanging from the walls. My first dilemma was what drink to order first: the beer selection is very impressive, but the handcrafted cocktails cleverly named after video game themes appealed more to the kid in me. Naturally I ordered the Barrel Roll, a whiskey based cocktail with ginger root. AMAZING. I wasn't very hungry but after spying hand battered deep fried pickles on the menu, I decided to treat myself to a little snack. ALSO AMAZING (with a little bit of a spicy kick as well).

After ordering my second cocktail, the Dry Heat (a spicy tequila based drink, also amazing) I decided to try my hand at some arcade games. First of all, I loved the fact that everything is free play. It's a brilliant business decision, because it made me want to stay longer and that equals more money spent on more drinks and food. The game selection is pretty decent and it was relatively easy to play all the games I wanted despite the large crowd. Everyone seemed to be considerate of letting others play.

The staff was incredible; our bartenders (Johnny and the other gentleman whose name I never caught) were both very helpful in helping us select our drinks all evening, and answering our million questions regarding different beers, cocktails and spirits. That kind of attentiveness to the customer in that busy environment does not go unnoticed and I was extremely impressed!

To wind this long review up, I'll just say that last night was one of the most fun nights I've had in Phoenix in a while and I will 100% without a doubt be back very soon as I'm very determined to beat my Spy Hunter record!


My only suggestions would be to turn the music up just a bit to create more of an atmosphere; nothing crazy loud, obviously you want to be able to have a conversation. At one point when I was killing it at Galaga a really good song came on and I remember thinking ""I wish this was a little louder, I'd SO be in my zone right now"". And second, use that projector for something amazing! Other barcades I've been to will project movies or video games on the wall for customers to play consoles like playstation or xbox on a giant screen (or wall in this case).",2016-06-12 17:27:54

The food was VERY good. It came out in large portions and very quickly. They offer the usual Mediterranean fare, I ordered the Gyro plate, Georgeann G had the lamb tongue sandwich, and we each also had a stuffed grape leaf. The stuffed grape leaves we served hot (which was a first) but they were HUGE compared to others I've had. The Meat was cooked to perfection (the lamb tongue was surprisingly very tasty) and the sides were freshly prepared as well. 

Words of advice: go with the sandwich instead of a plate. The plate came with about 2 pounds of rice that was completely not needed (and the total price would've been much less if ordered separately). If you still want more, add a side salad or something.

The prices were very good and the service was nothing to complain about. It was hard to resist the baklava by the register, and we ended up taking a piece of cashew baklava to go (which was heavenly).

It's partly due to people gawking at the Macs or surfing the free internet. Or people actually buying a Mac (lucky, rich bastards!). But it's usually due to the fact that no matter what issue you have, their customer service is spot on..and I'm a PC owner (please don't tell).

I've been having an issue with my phone and went into Apple on the advice of Telus. I set up my appt online thru Genius Bar. I've never had to go into Apple for an actual issue so I wasn't sure what the process is when you enter the store. From the dumbfounded look on my face, I was greeted right away by a rep and asked if I needed help. I let them know why I was there and they told me they would let someone know. Within about 15 min, my name was called. I wasn't used to that. I'm used to trying to make eye contact with a sales rep, having them seem less interested when they realize they can sell you anything & then get completely frustrated at their lackluster responses. Things were already looking up for Apple.

I wish I could remember the guy who helped me. He was great. He tried every possible way to fix my phone and explain each step as he did it. He also added to our conversation. My friend and I were going thru a list of ""I just won the lottery beyotch and I'm looking for a place to live and gloat"" and he was on my side for Liberty Village. Gotta love a man who takes my side!

I was in Apple for about 45 minutes, exceeding the supposed 10-min alloted slot times for the appointment. But I learned that most people know when they go into Apple, it may take awhile as they are thorough. It meant something that the guy helping me would be genuinely concerned over the issue and do everything he possibly could to fix it. When the issue hadn't been fixed, he let me know to go to Telus and see if they could fix it and, if not, to still come back to Apple and they'll try again. It still hasn't been fixed but the service alone put the Apple Store in my good books.

Man this place has changed since this place opened up. Gone are the Japanese skewers made to order and seasoned quite nicely and priced reasonably. Not sure if the place changed owners or management but the name is no longer ""BeeGee"" but ""BG"" not a huge difference but they determined it's important enough to make the change.

Anyway i had a GroupOn that was expiring soon and didn't know they canc'ed the skewers.

Had to order over 20 to make the groupon worth it so i grabbed the Salmon Teriyaki Bento box and a shrimp yakisoba to go.

The salmon was small and drenched with sauce. No real taste of salmon just mostly sauce. The sweet potato tempura was a nice touch really wasnt expect that and thought it was a carrot. Shrimp tempura wasnt anything special, just lightly battered and deep fried shrimp. Salad was alright.

Overall i dont see myself coming back. The food is just 'okay' and since i no longer live on this side of town and there's no skewers there's kind of no point any longer.",2012-10-10 03:55:42

The perfect balance of freshness and deliciousness without the sodium kick. I have dreams about this stuff. And by dreams, I mean regularly.

The Mongolian Delight:  Shrimp, beef, and chicken with veggies in a delicious brown sauce, with a small bit of heat to it.  Really amazing.
The salted fish and chicken fried rice:  sounds gross, tastes great.  Little tiny bites of a salty fish mixed with chicken fried rice...I don't even need soy sauce on this rice, it is that good. 
The Crab Rangoons:  amazing.  Just as good as when it was Chengs.  Not quite as awesome as Kung Fu Thai, but REALLY good.  Creamy, with noticeable pieces of crab.
Wonton Soup:  YUM.  Rich broth, yummy wontons...this is all I crave when I don't feel well.

The onion rings did have a different batter, a bit sweet, and got their only taste from the salt sprinkled on them. The fish was just a square, like you'd get from your grocer's freezer, so I''m not sure what we're paying for. Even their sauce was like a sweeter ketchup.

When we first got there, we headed to the food court for something to eat.  The food court is similar to T&T except that it has not just Chinese food, but other cuisine as well.  They had Indian food, a shawarma station, and some North American food as well.  The prices were dirt cheap.  We got a huge container of General Tao's Chicken for $3.99.  And an equally huge container of Veal Biriyani for $3.99.  My husband wanted to try the beef pie (it was like a chicken pot pie, but beef and not in an aluminium pie container) ($2.99).  It was an individual serving size.  We also got some Har Gow - 4 for $1.99.  I got a strawberry sago drink ($1.59) and my mom got the taro one.   

The General Tao's Chicken was delicious.  Mostly white breast meat, not too much batter.  Hot and cripsy.  Mostly sweet, with a bit of tang.  Not spicy at all though.  The Veal Biriyani was mostly rice, not too much veal.  And the little veal that it contained was really fatty and had tendons and other sinewy bits.  There was also pieces of bone.  I was not a fan.  The rice itself was nicely spiced and had a spicy kick to it, which I enjoyed, but this did not make up for the aforementioned disappointment.  The Har Gow was great.  Just like at any respectable dim sum restaurant.  The beef pie was mostly crust and not enough pie, however my husband said that overall he enjoyed it.  The sago drinks were good.  They are a little bit like bubble tea except the bubbles are made of tiny tapioca beads so they are really soft and translucent and not chewy and dark like traditional bubble tea.  They also have some pieces of gelatin in it.  Mine tasted like strawberry milk with tapioca and gelatin pieces.    

The grocery store itself is very large.  Lots of spaces in the aisles.  They have a huge variety of ethnic foods.  Prices are really good for some items and about average for others.  The bulk section looked a little dirty, as people took stuff and then changed their minds and just left the bagged bulk foods in the bulk food area.  I'm not sure what they do with that food at the end of the day, whether they throw it out, keep it bagged and sell it at a discount, or dump it back into the bulk containers to sell the following day.  The bulk area looked much messier than everywhere else.  The bakery area is also a bit messy.  They have large trays of baked goods stacked on top of each other and you can go and bag your own baked goods.  I'm sure when they first bring everything out it looks good, but by the evening, things are picked over and it looks messy and unhygienic and people could have dropped items on the floor and then just put them back on the trays.  The washrooms are also filthy.  Do not go to the washrooms unless you really have to.  With the exception of these 3 areas, the rest of the store looks very clean and orderly.  The contrast is quite remarkable.  They need to clean up their act with the bulk section, the bakery and the washrooms.  I don't know why they let these places get so bad while the rest of the store is so much nicer.  

Parking is plentiful, and seating in the food court area is ample.",2014-04-20 19:45:13

Lots of cool shops and things to do but getting there parking or even public transportation is too annoying. It has to be something special for me to head to the Southside.

My partner and I we're going to go to dinner before we headed to a show and we were trying to decide where to go. Do we do something fun and classy and spend maybe a little bit more money than we wanted to? Or do we go and get wings. Of course we decided to go get wings

I'm not saying that we're not classy and we don't like to spend a little bit of money on good food but considering that my graduation was last week saving money on food really was something I need to do. Archie's has delicious food. This was maybe the second time that I've been here and I was really impressed with the size of their wings and with the flavor choices. They had celery and carrots with ranch and blue cheese which is a usual for wings but I found some places that don't offer this on the side.

When looking over the wing choices we decided to order 20 wings, so two orders of 10. Because we got two orders of 10 we were able to get two choices of sauces. If you wanted to split up the orders into more sauces you had to pay extra. We went with a dry Cajun and the honey mustard. Both were delicious. Next time that I would be there I would ask them to throw a little bit more seasoning on the dry Cajun but other than that it was great. The honey mustard was also dripping with sauce just the way I like it. And the cool crunch of those celery and carrot sticks really went above and beyond.

I also ordered a side salad which was huge and only ate about half of it. Sometimes when you're doing fried food for dinner you might want to add a little more vegetables. I probably could have passed. But I will say I did eat that salad the next day.

The staff was really fun and attentive. They made me laugh a lot. I would definitely come back here for wings. I hear that they do have some specials and maybe I'll come back on a day where I can partake in those. Really nice spot with ample seating and my favorite part was you could actually hear the person across the table from you.",2017-12-30 16:50:59

We sat down around 4:30 for a really early dinner, there was  nobody in the place until we left, then it started to fill up. This was nice because we basically picked exactly where we wanted to sit. 

The décor is really intriguing. It is a brewery so a lot of the equipment they use is visible. Along with the dark colored theme and old school rock and roll music playing, the vibe at Destihl is a pretty neat, yet modern one!

We began with some appetizers that included the spinach salad, ale cheese soup and pastrami rolls. The salad and soup were fantastic, the latter of the two being some of the best ""beer cheese"" soup I've ever had, although I might say that about most beer cheese soups! However, we were a little let down by the pastrami rolls, they were nothing exceptional and we were kicking ourselves for not getting the beer-battered bacon instead.

My mother did try one of their beers. I forget the name but it was really dark, yet surprisingly light tasting. Not sure if I liked the flavor personally, but mom said it was decent.

For dinner we had the Cuban Po' boy, the Chicken pot pie, and the Farm and Field burger. My dad got the Po' boy from the waitresses recommendation and was pleased with how it tasted. Mom's chicken pot pie was just fair. She liked the filo (phyllo?) bread, but was a little turned off by how the dish was executed overall. I guess there was a lot of greens in it and it utilized a cut up chicken breast, where the chicken pot pie she really enjoys has many other vegetables and more of a tender part of meat. She still said it wasn't bad! I got the Farm and Field burger which was a bison and lamb mix, complete with arugula, tomato, some heavily soy caramelized onions and aioli sauce. The meat was good, not too much gamier than a regular burger but there was a difference. I ordered it medium and felt it might have come out a bit more like medium-well. It was also hard to taste all the unique flavors to the burger, as the onions were very heavily caramelized and gave everything a really sweet molasses-like flavor. It still was good though!

Service was fine, our server took pretty good care of us and gave us everything we needed as well as provided some good recommendations.

My only qualm with Destihl would have to be the price. I know there are a lot of unique items on the menu, but I just thought everything was a little overpriced when said and done. My burger was good, but it was approaching $20! The portions are pretty large, which makes it a tad bit better.

Overall still a solid 4/5, another good option in downtown Champaign!",2015-01-20 20:20:01

q6u_G0TQShadjCEsyxdm2Q,kHGRDaZt4nHgNSJcjOTDeQ,HQl28KMwrEKHqhFrrDqVNQ,3,1,0,0,"Had a Saturday evening dinner with friends.  Going to Deagan's was my idea based on the overwhelming positive Yelp reviews, and I was pretty pleased with the end result.  We opted to share a number of plates, so I was happy to get a taste of a number of dishes--11 to be exact:  

We started out with the Big Board ($20), a large selection of meats, cheeses, crackers, olives, spreads, nuts, fruits, and probably other things thrown in there as well.  There was a lot of food on this board, and it lasted the five of us well into the rest of the meal--a pretty good value selection.

The bacon-wrapped dates (Devils on Horseback, 3 pieces, $6) were very good.  I thought they tasted better and were better-prepared than the similar dish at Light Bistro.

The Moroccan Meatballs (2 pieces, $8) were okay--your pretty basic tapas staple.  I don't think the Wagyu Kobe beef really came through at all with the dish (nor might one expect it to when in meatball form).  

The Spicy Shrimp Tacos (2 tacos, $9) were heavenly--the avocado, corn, and cilantro came together really well with the shrimp and soft tortilla.  This was easily the best dish of the night.  

The Peking Duck Confit Mac & Cheese (bowl, $8) was a major disappointment, everyone at the table agreed.  I like Peking Duck, and I like Mac & Cheese, but this combination just did not work out.  The taste of the duck was overpowered and drowned out by the Mahon cheese.  

The lobster croquette (special, 2 pieces) was also a miss in my opinion.  It had a seafood taste about it but not something you would instantly zero-in on being lobster.

The table also had an heirloom tomatoes and mozzarella cheese salad (special, 1 plate).  I did not have any, but it looked good and had a pretty positive response from the other guests at the table.

We also shared two sides: The Pork Belly Brussel Sprouts ($5) and the Truffled Cream Corn ($5).  It was probably a mistake to try to share these smaller-portioned dishes.  I didn't get to taste enough of the brussel sprouts to give a good opinion on them.  The cream corn is also not a side that lends itself to sharing, and while the strong aroma from the truffle oil is pleasant, I can't positively say it added to the cream corn.

We closed the main portion of the meal by sharing a plate of Amish Chicken and Waffles ($17).  The cayenne butter on top of the fried chicken provided a nice background accent.  The maple syrup with Ohio blackberries was just okay, but a necessary compliment to the waffle.  For comparison's sake, I would take Deagan's version on this classic combination over South Side's similar dish.

For dessert, the table shared the Lion Stout Brownie Sundae (bowl, $7) and two scoops of Mitchell's white chocolate rocky road ice cream ($6).  I couldn't really taste where the ""Lion Stout"" portion of the brownie sundae came in, but it was still a pleasant mix of hot and cold items for dessert.

I thought the restaurant had a nice vibe, centered around the large bar in the middle of the main dining space.  I liked the touch of having Trivial Pursuit cards at ready disposal around the bar.  Service was about average.  One observation is that as more and more places use a small plates/large plates menu, restaurants (in general, not just Deagan's) need to do a better of job of being attuned to differences in serving a table sharing dishes and one following the more traditional, entree approach.  Or maybe all I'm trying to say is that a ""sharing table"" needs to be checked on more frequently by the server for switching out dirty plates, seeing if the diners want to order more food, and not necessarily bringing out all of the small plates orders at the same time.  This pace should be a little bit more uptempo, and the experience more interactive.

Overall, Deagan's gets a ""high"" three star Yelp review--if there were a 3.5 stars grade, I probably would have given it.  The Spicy Shrimp Tacos and Devils on Horseback were excellent.  Slight improvements in service and maybe 1 or 2 more solid dishes, and it would definitely reach four-star level.",2011-07-03 04:09:29

Love the fact that they have a separate elevator that takes you directly to the restaurant from the parking garage so you don't have to walk through the casino.  Depending on the hours of the day, expect to wait as they do not take reservations.  

Their bread (with phenomenal butter and jam) is a great way to start the meal!  I love their coffee... it is always strong but the temperature can be hotter, in my opinion.  I LOVE their Saumon Fume (smoked salmon with petite baguette, chive cream cheese, red onion, tomato, & capers)!  4 out of 5 times, I will order that dish as you can NEVER go wrong!  I've tried the Hachis de Boeuf (corned beef hash served with two eggs) and all sort of their omelet specials of the day but l will always regret that I didn't order my Saumon Fume!  

Why did I give Bouchon 4 stars versus 5?!  The truth is... it's the people working there.  Not sure what it is but the employees NEVER smile!  The front desk hostesses (there are always 2-3 of them) are always busy talking to each other.  They NEVER smile and always give you that ""pissed-off"" look like you are such a burden when you arrive.  As for the servers ...  Well,... to be honest, I think I only had ONE GREAT experience with a gentleman while the rest of them are just ""order takers"".  For such a fancy restaurant, you would think that they would be happier to give you a 5-star service dining experience.

It's clean and well-maintained (including the ""Goddesses"" restroom). It also has friendly staff, a diverse group of patrons, a great outdoor patio (featuring appropriately-themed ""Roman"" columns), and perhaps, most importantly, features karaoke on Thursday - Saturday nights. My husband and I went on a Friday night for karaoke with Stevey P and Kristin S and their SOs and had a great time. 

The singers' talent is definitely better than your average karaoke dive bar, and the song choice was good, but as an avid karaoke singer, I didn't like the fact that there was no separate stage or area carved out for the current singer to stand. We just had to stand by our chairs or between tables and strain our necks to look up at the lyrics. Karaoke also wasn't the central focus of the place, with much *very loud* talking and socializing going on in spite of (or because of?) the singing. I'm not going to penalize Apollo's for this too much, though, because I know only serious karaoke freaks like me want it to be the focus.  

One other complaint - some of us in the group were also a little disappointed with our weak our drinks were - I don't know if this was just crowd control, but with a final tab of $70 or so, we expected to be feeling a little more loopy than we did for most of the night. Speaking of feeling loopy, we were appreciative of how helpful the bartenders were when we wanted to call a cab, and one came fairly quickly after they called one for us. 

Apparently, the company that does karaoke here is the same as the one that does it at Kobalt (another gay bar in Midtown's Park Central complex). If you are into a social and dynamic bar scene with a pretty diverse crowd and karaoke as part of the experience, you will really like Apollo. However, if you ever want to go somewhere a little more low-key and really focus on the karaoke part, you might want to check Kobalt out.",2008-08-27 21:42:40

This place is pretty good. The appetizers and rolls with AYCE are amongst the better places in town. The server we had was back very frequently to check on us and the sushi chefs were engaging.

It came out and looked very fresh but it smelled as if it were treated with something to preserve the fish. There was a slight taste of vinegar or something as well. I couldn't really place it. But the cuts were very generous and once past the ""treated smell / taste"" it had a good taste. I base my sushi experience pretty solely on the freshness / taste of the nigiri / sashimi so they're gonna take a hit on this one.

Overall, a nice substitute for my fave sushi place in town when I was on a tight time schedule. Not a place I'd visit again unless the same circumstances arise with better places close by.",2012-01-05 03:58:21

My wife and I had reservations on a Friday night as we expected OP to be very busy.  Well, the restaurant was never half full.  One of the reasons for the one star reduction was that they had several open booths but, even with reservations, seated us at a table near the kitchen in the middle of everything.  We were there 2 hours and two booths were never used.  Guess maybe they actually were waiting for Sophia Loren or Sammy Davis Jr. to show up...and I thought those tags on the table were only a joke...silly me!

Based on taste alone, easily 5 stars.  The She Crab Bisque was flavored perfectly and had a nice small crab fritter in the middle.  The corn was sweet, crunchy, and fresh.  The only problem was it was served barely warm..almost cool.  For main courses my wife had blackened swordfish and I had Lobster Tail with Truffle Butter.  The lobster was amazing.  Perfectly cooked, tender, sweet and covered with orgasmic truffle butter.  They claim everything on the menu is a 9oz portion, but the lobster tail did seem a bit small.  Could just be I wanted more it was so good or it just looked so lonely presented alone on such a big plate.  My wife adores swordfish but doesn't get it often with all the controversy these days.  She is happy she used the opportunity here to have it.  Perfectly blackened and very moist.  The spices were just right...so many times blackened items can be over spiced.  I'm not a big fish-fish eater but would order this anytime.  We split a side of Truffled Mac and Cheese.  OMG...I would love to make an entire meal out of this guilty pleasure sometime.  Even if it means not being able to walk for days.  The server told me a lot of the employees get there early so they can eat a bowl of it before work.  For dessert (like we should have even attempted at this point) we shared the monstrously huge Baked Alaska.  This too was fantastic.  It is made with Vanilla, Chocolate, and Black Raspberry ice cream they make there, sitting in chocolate and raspberry sauces, and covered with beautifully torched meringue.  It could easily have fed three or four.  The coffee is individually pressed at the table.  Very nice presentation but the coffee itself was quite bitter.

In terms of service our waitress was very friendly but a bit slow to check back.  I believe she was fairly new as she had to think a bit to describe the special and other dishes.  But, she had a great smile and was very nice so not a problem.

Bottom line, this is a great seafood restaurant that I can't wait to go back to!",2009-10-17 21:45:53

Hello Betty... I'm a fan. A nice combination of good food, a solid beer line-up, fast & friendly service and cheap prices.... what else could you ask for?

The GOOD:

- Service was excellent for a ""dive bar"", never had to wait for anything. The minute my glass was empty, I was asked if I wanted another (answered yes every time!).

- Prices are CHEAP for downtown. Huge portion food options were in the $9 - $12 range. However, beer was standard downtown pricing.

- The Betty's Burger was pretty good. Lot's of add on options. I had with pemeal bacon and sauteed mushrooms. Easily one of the BEST ""beer drinking"" establishment burgers. 

- Great BEER selection - About 40 bottled beers, roughly 30 permanent drafts and approximately 10 rotating beers on tap. I enjoyed the Maisel's Dunkel (Dark Weis beer. Good local craft beer options as well. 

- Betty's is for everyone. Broad mix of clients - students, locals, seniors and ""aged between students and senior folks"" like myself.

- The place is HUGE. The wait for tables never really extended beyond 10 minutes on a  busy Friday night from what I could see.

- They also have private party rooms and a cool patio.

and the NOT so GOOD:

- Call me a beer snob but they use the same standard glass for  all beers. Certainly not the end of the world....

- Nachos were average at best (but huge portion and cheap).

I will be back for sure. A great place to hang out with friends in a laid back setting & enjoying some good beer / decent food.

I remember the first time going to FP (In Tempe) and thinking the place was pretty cool, good crowd, laid back. Met a big group of friends there so it was a great time! The thing I remember most was how good the food was. 

In my opinion the Scottsdale location isn't great as far as the setup and decor goes. Great crowd though so that pretty much cancels out what the place looks like. The beer is great and love drinking micro brews. The menu is what you would expect for a brew pub but everything I've tried is a step above. 

Let me tell you about the fish and chips... I've tried talking myself into ordering them quite a few times but can never bring myself to. For some reason I'm never in the mood for them. My friend that I meet for lunch there orders them pretty much every time so today was my day!!!! Beer battered fried goodness is all I have to say! Where have these things been all of my life? The cod was flaky and not fishy tasting at all... The crispy beer battered texture on the outside was perfect and not too crunchy.

The pool was our favorite part of our stay--we spent hours swimming and lounging by the pool, enjoying drinks and having a few appetizers. The staff working the pool area were awesome & very attentive. 

The hotel itself is beautifully modern and well-designed. It feels like staying in an art gallery! Our room was gorgeous and decorated with monochromatic interior design pieces, and the shower/vanity was beautiful too.

Hearth 61, the hotel restaurant, was so delicious! But be aware--these are definitely some Scottsdale prices! You may have come for the cheap summer rates, but you'll get sticker shock when you see how expensive even breakfast is. But is it worth it?! YES! Everything was impeccably cooked and seasoned, and we will be back to their restaurant for sure (for a special occasion, of course). The views of the mountain and pool area from the restaurant are simply stunning. 

The main reason I'm giving 4 stars is like what many others have said--construction. 

They started rather early in the morning and even I'm an early riser. It didn't bother me as much, but my husband was pissed! But their construction will end soon, so I recommend definitely keeping Mountain Shadows in mind for your next resort stay. 

What I absolutely loved is that I only saw one family with kids! The real upside to this being a modern, upscale resort is that you don't tend to see the pool and hotel restaurant areas flooded with children (i.e. less obnoxious kids yelling, running around and ruining the romantic atmosphere).",2017-07-19 13:26:09

XYZ smells of delicious BBQ as you walk in the door. They do all their own smoking with cherry wood on location. The atmosphere is casual industrial and cozy in an old brick building.

The specials for each night are creative combinations of a shot and a beer, like fireball and angry orchard as a classic candy apple. Then there are food specials as well.

We ordered the BBQ special which was a choice of pulled pork, half chicken or half slab ribs served with coleslaw and fries for $10! The serving of pulled pork was generous. It was lean and moist and had a delicious smoke to it. The sauce was served on the side and was one of the best I've ever had. The coleslaw was very lightly dressed, which I appreciated, and the fresh cut fries, good. We also had a separate additional order of fries, a draft beer and a shot and beer special and the bill came to $25.

You have not eaten proper steamed dumplings until you've been to Shanghai.  Upon returning I went on a quest for these dumplings in my home city and with the help from my relatives, I was rewarded here at Asian Legend.  I'm embarrassed to say so but they've been around since 1988 and I've never been? They have expanded to half a dozen locations in the GTA and their food is consistent.  This is one of the nicer/cleaner Chinese restaurants in the downtown that won't break the bank (compared to the Crown Princess which I reviewed recently). 

For Shanghai dumplings, hands down, the closest you will find to the real deal but if you want the authentic one's to compare you'll need to get your passport validated and make your way to China.  The secret to good dumplings is thin layer of dough holding the soup inside.  That requires special cooking skills as it will likely break during the steaming process unless you make it thick skin (which tastes like too much dough and is what you will typically find at other restaurants here).  The only issue is they rather small and cost almost $6 a basket... I can eat these by the truck load.

In China, they have these dumpling kiosks everywhere like we have Tim Hortons and they're only 8 RMB for 8 pieces (that's about $1 CAD).  Other dishes you should try is the beef brisket noodles in soup and general tao chicken (fried and crispy but yummy).  Their other rice, noodle dishes are reasonably priced, decent portions and average quality or better.  4 stars if you order the right items and they do take out plus delivery :)   I usually go with family or friends as I hate dining alone but the place doesn't hold large groups but there are rooms in the dungeon downstairs for small groups.

When we got our order, they had split the steak and eggs for us which was nice! The whole plate was divine! The steak was so tender and I love the combo with fries!

Out of the eight of us, three got chicken and waffles, three got the southern fried chicken and I of course had to be different and got the jerk bbq chicken. The food itself was delicious. I ordered the catfish layfette as a start because I know for a fact no one in my family has tried it and I absolutely love it. I definitely was not disappointed at the food at all.

The service was just the same, there was no let down there. When my family and I get together we are unintentionally a huge annoyance. However he seemed pretty chill when he was around and he could hear our conversation.

Parking-  on Sunday's and in the evening during the week, u can park in the back for free.  There is no parking in the front.  Other then that, you'll have to park down the side streets or farther down the main road I guess.  

Let's just say I was SOOOOO disappointed.  To the point I would never come back nor would I suggest it to others.  

Service- the girl that seated us, she was nice.  We had this tag team, 2 girl servers probably right about 21 yrs old.  Neither knew the 1st thing about serving.   And at least one was more pleasant while the other one was not pleasant at all and quite rude.  I ordered a hot toddy.  I was given a glass w/a shot of whisky and a little pot of hot water and a lemon.  They walk away quick.  I had to wait at least 10 minutes to get their attention so I could get the honey and tea bag!  Then she brings me the wrong tea.  When she brings me the right tea, she says ""here you go lady!""....lets just say, I had a baseball cap on and most people think I'm in my late 20's/early 30's... Even if I was OLDER, talking to anyone like the way she did is just not right.   After we were done eating she would walk by and always look the opposite direction.  Once I tried to b a little louder and said ""excuse me"", at which point she turned to look at us and just kept walking by.... 

Food- the menu is very limited!!  We kept flipping it over, like 'this is it'.   We got the chicken & waffles since we had that before and remembered loving it, and the Mac n cheese.  The Waffles were so bland and tasteless!  The syrup and butter did not help.   The chicken was dry and bland as well.  What the heck happened!!!  Came with a side of roasted Brussels sprouts.  With salt added, they were good.   The Mac n cheese came w/a side salad w/soft greens and their house dressing.  Kinda strange to get a cold salad served on a hot dish along side Mac n cheese.  But it was ok.   The Mac n cheese was the best part of the meal.  I got a side of Sriracha sauce and it made it even better (btw, the chicken n waffles did not come w/ a hot sauce, doesn't it usually?

Anyways, when we arrived, I didn't really know what to expect. From the outside, this place looked a little sketchy. The sign has graffiti on it and the little strip mall this is located in just seemed kind of small and not in the best of neighborhoods. Anyways, when we walked in, we were acknowledged by a server and she told us to pick a table to sit down. When we sat down, we were given 2 cups of water and a closed styrofoam container. Wasn't too sure what that styrofoam container was for and thought our server accidentally put it on our table and that she boxed up someone's leftovers at another table.

Inside the styrofoam container is cold boiled peanuts so we started eating that as we were deciding what to order. Our server came by pretty quickly and we ended up ordering:

2 orders of Bibimbap in a stone pot- delicious! Just as good as any other place I have had bibimbap. Loved the crunchy rice as well (the benefits of ordering this in a stone pot/ bowl). 

Chicken Musubi- Delicious! I didn't know musubi could be made with chicken since I have always seen it only with spam. The only thing is that the chicken was a bit oily, but that's expected at a down home place like this.

Spam Musubi- I didn't get a bite of this but my husband liked it. The size for this musubi and the chicken one was a pretty big piece. 

Our meal was also rounded out with some banchan. We got 4 little plates and my favorite was this one with broccoli. One man, whom I suspect is one of the owners (or maybe the manager) refilled our banchan throughout our meal. Our server was great at refilling our water. This other guy (I guess you can call him a server to?) also refilled our water and was really friendly. Service was very attentive, quick and very friendly.

I went here with a group of about nine people, and even though six of the nine people were present, they didn't seat us until everyone was present.  Hmm, ok.  This was on a quiet Monday evening.

We're seated and I will give credit to the server as she was very pleasant and attentive.  There was rarely a time a beverage glass was empty. 

The food leaves a lot to be desired.  I had the carne asada taco plate with a side of guacamole.  It was as if nothing had any seasoning.  I understand Americanized Mexican food, I really do, and I did not go in here with the expectation of getting super-flavorful food, but I did expect some seasoning.

I really want to give this place a higher rating..  But I can't 

Do I like the food here?  At times yes, at times no.

What do I mean by that?

Well, the menu is bizarrely based around onions and peppers and I don't understand why..

Order a jerk chicken wrap..  It has peppers and onions.  Order a shombo steak wrap..  It has peppers and onions.  BBQ chicken?  Yep. Basil chicken?  Yep.  

Order a side of rice, and guess what it has in it?  Peppers and onions!

Like come on guys, give me a break on the peppers and onions already.  There are some days I want iceberg lettuce in my wrap, or days where I don't want the all day burps that comes with eating loads of onions.  Or days when I'm hungover, and would love to have a local place to go for wraps, but I want to choose my toppings instead of having them chosen FOR me..  

I have a feeling the owner loves onions and is putting them in everything just assuming everyone else likes them too..  Bad choice

I've tried saying little onions, or less peppers, but they always come the exact same way which has me thinking they are pre mixed

I found myself here with a group of friends last week and it was a blast.  This place has a few rooms - not sure if they are all the same size but we were in Room 1 and it comfortably held our group of about 12/13 people.  In this room there was one big screen and 2 smaller tvs to each side of the screen - this way no matter where you were sitting you could sing along to the lyrics.  The funniest thing was the background videos they played to the songs...race cars, asian pop groups dancing..etc.  

There is a small bar outside - a fridge with water, pop and a few alcoholic drinks.  Nothing fancy but will get the job done.

It runs about $60/hour which I think is pretty cheap if you are going with a large group.  There are plenty of song choices here - even Asian versions of popular English songs.  They have all the classics like Bohemian Rhapsody, to the more funnier  - the Thong Song - to even soca/dancehall - Tempted to Touch.  Seriously - you can pretty much find whatever song you want to sing in this place.  The song lists were quite impressive.

There is a street parking and a Green P lot across the street.  Also extremely easy access by TTC as Christie station is literally across the street from here.

*There are 3 floors for this location with the first and second floor available to the public. The third floor seems to be for a big party and require reservation in advance, so it was closed to the public.

*Though the Bay location is opened near the main street, it's actually a bit hidden and very quite. I also like that they aren't blasting loud obnoxious mainstream music like some other coffee shops either. 

*I ordered JVO (Jimmy's Very Own) and an almond croissant.
I ordered the JVO for $4 and the hazelnut croissant for $2-3? The JVO - Jimmy's very own was an iced vanilla latte with caramel drizzle.The iced latte was not too strong, smooth and the barista applied the right amount of caramel drizzle so the syrup wasn't overpowering the drink.

On the other hand the pastry wasn't my favorite. It was not too sweet and had a strong almond taste so it goes well with a cup of coffee. However the croissant was stale and the outer layer was too flaky. There is nothing I hate more than biting into a croissant and having it disintegrate into a million flaky crumbs :(. Also, does anyone hate it when someone cover the entire croissant with powdered sugar?

-Aptly named.

I have a neat French Press that I got from here for around $13. The cool thing about this store is that you don't really know what you're going to find. There are aisles designated for certain things, but the categories aren't concrete-meaning you're bound to find something that doesn't belong in the home decor aisle, but that may belong in your home. 

The store has great reduced prices. The only problem is that they place date stickers on the items; which will give you a greater discount if it falls further back than the date listed on the discount signs throughout the store. This is problematic because they tend to put new stickers on older items to reduce the amount of discount you receive.

First off, huge props go to Sarah K, Pierre T, and Jeffrey O for meeting me out in nondescript west Phoenix for Chinese food. I've been trying for two whole years to get people to meet me here for dim sum and the thought of ""dining in west Phoenix"" turns off just about everyone (especially most native Phoenicians I know who are surprisingly ""west side""-phobic.). So a big thank you to you guys for indulging me.

Next, the restaurant itself. Imagine a giant banquet-hall sized Chinese restaurant actually filled with mostly Chinese customers. Families seated around big round tables: grandma, grandpa, mom, dad, and the little kids. In Phoenix, this is a rare sight, and as opposite to seeing Grandma Ethel eating fried wontons with sweet & sour sauce at the Abacus Inn as it could be. So you know from the get go that Great Wall is doing something right with authenticity. 

We sat down and were immediately brought tea, and if you've ever been to dim sum, you know that servers are constantly wandering around, pushing carts full of goodies. Steamed dumplings, fried dumplings, sweet dumplings, savory dumplings, buns, giant flaky egg rolls, stir fried kai-lan (Chinese broccoli), chicken feet, custard and other desserts, lo mai gai (sticky rice), noodles, the list goes on and on and on. We picked a variety of dishes as they went by (sans chicken feet), and went to town. 

I'd say the dim sum we had was pretty decent. Not the best dim sum I've ever had, but obviously I liked it all enough because I was a nonstop eating machine until I was ready to burst (which was frustrating because there were so many more dishes being carted around that I wanted to try but I just. Couldn't. Do. It.) To be fair to Great Wall, probably next time I'd come earlier than 11 am and request a table closer to the kitchen in order to get the dim sum as warm and fresh as possible, instead of picking dishes that have been carted around the dining room for who knows how long. 

The atmosphere was great - there's a certain cacophony in big dim sum halls that I really enjoy. Tables full of families and friends talking, laughing, and enjoying their food as more than a dozen servers are hovering around with their carts. And the best thing about us finishing our meal with us stuffed to the gills? Only $11 plus change per person. You really can't beat that.

All in all, a great change of pace from all my dismal Chinese restaurant experiences in Phoenix. And a restaurant like this will no doubt also have a full-on Chinese menu along with their standard Americanized menu for lunch and dinner, so I'll definitely have to swing by and try that as well. 

So if you're ready to try Great Wall for some weekend dim sum, let me know and I'll be more than glad to join you. 

Just not today. 

Because I'm still full.

Seriously salsa and tacos are 2 of the most exciting foods ever for pretty much every member of our family and when you find a restaurant with a whole list of each as options and they turn out to be this delicious, we started wondering why we'd never eaten here before. 

We ordered the Habanero & Green Jalapeño  salsas with chips to start. The Habanero packed some serious heat & after burn so I had to dip lightly on that one. Hubby dove in with abandon because he loves the heat and most often can't get anything hot enough. This was totally to his liking. The green jalapeño wasn't overly hot but had delightful flavor. We'd love to go back and try the Chipoltle and the Spicy Mango, too. 

The mini tacos are a great deal at 4 for $9 with the option of choosing 2 varieties. I chose the braised pork and El Pastor with crispy pork and pineapple. Yum on both with serious high praise for the El Pastor. Hubby tried the pork and Tinga, which was a chicken taco with lots of great flavor. 

The restaurant is really cute with a nice rustic style located downstairs off Penn Avenue with some communal and smaller tables plus a small bar. I could see it getting somewhat loud when it's crowded since sound seemed to reverberate.

I hate giving bad reviews but on my latest visit, I should have listened to my gut and not repeated my visit here. Naturally, I'm not a stranger to this chain, understand it's a chain, but the past visit here was just not good.

Came with my brother on a Sunday after a driving lesson. We were hungry and this was his way of paying for gas money. We were seated in the dining area. Every time we are seated in the dining area it's a bad experience. On the bar side you get entertainment, the beer flights/draft specials are decent and the bar food/appetizers are passable.

It started off with the soft drinks. I'm not a pop drinkers so when I want a simple diet pepsi I expect it not to taste funky [and yes, I prefer the weird twang of diet drinks to sugar in a glass taste of regular]. There was incorrect carbonation, whether they were running out [I suspect this], no ice [lukewarm] or they had just hooked up a new box [unlikely]. I sent it back.

My brother got a burger which he said was fine, it came with an egg on it and he found himself satisfied. I tried to steal a few of his fries, which were a failure. They tasted like the off brand in the freezer section [a full mouth of starch], and were barely crispy enough. So abandon plan. On my own dish I had the classic mac n' chicken. First of all, the pasta was crispy?, really?, it wasn't a cheese sauce, it was pretty much butter baked on and sprinkled in Parmesan and smothered in breadcrumbs. And when I say smothered here, this is not a good thing. Sigh. The chicken was pushed to the bottom of the pan, which my brother tasted because I was turned off my this version of my favorite dish, and said it was cooked properly. A small save? 

Again - I sent it back after about 3 bites. The waitress came back asking if I wanted a box, I told her to take it away. She did and disappeared into oblivion until we had to flag her down for the check, which I didn't see as my brother paid for it while I used the restroom, I hope they didn't charge us for the pop drink.... Needless to say, I came home hungry.

Ordering inside is disorganized. There's no indication where the line for ordering begins. Basically, you just stand around and read the menu until someone comes by and asks if you're ready to order. After ordering, you're given a number and your food is delivered to your table. Kind of reminds me of eating at Carl's Jr. 

Hot Cakes Combo: I didn't finish my order of eggs, bacon (sausage patties are also an option), and two basic pancakes. My scrambled eggs were the best part. They weren't seasoned, but I prefer them that way. The bacon was greasy and shriveled, and the pancakes....well, they had tiny, mysterious BLUE SPECKS. Yech!

Ham and Cheese Omelette: This was my boyfriend's order. The omelette was hearty with ham, cheese, and diced green bell peppers. Surprisingly, it wasn't bad. Other than that, the toast was horrible, as well as the sausage patties. 

Biscuits and Gravy: To be honest, we weren't sure if this was on their menu when we ordered, but they delivered. So much for biscuits, this was essentially pancakes and gravy, which was seasoned heavily with pepper and had a strong sausage flavor. Not. Good.

They gave me two cute sibling kittens, maybe about five weeks old at best. They didn't tell us where they found them, but I think they were most likely abandoned.

I really liked this place. It was pretty packed here on a Saturday night when we went. I also liked how there's a little fountain right next to it. Makes it feel peaceful. Bonus? It's like 5 minutes from my house! I'll definitely be coming here again soon especially with this amazing weather we've been having. =P",2013-06-25 16:54:02

kuZnEC2euggRdR-CWJD1Ng,kwS_MjOUs1Jd_4X7B5t2yQ,HexCnP_tQFgXH6QD9UlJWw,4,6,1,4,"Love love love this place: Mostly based on the cheaper/super competitive prices, large selection and employee owned culture- from my understanding- each employee is given shares when they are hired so they can have office pride and ownership. It makes the employees really take pride in the store making sure it is neat and organized. The feel is exactly like a warehouse without the membership prices of sams and Costco.
As soon as you walk in, they have the signs where it is noted to compare similar market prices (walmart, safeway, vons, smiths) to ensure you are getting the cheapest price. Good steals on bulk food and produce. 
To save money, they only allow CASH OR DEBIT. No credit. Which keeps the prices down. Also you must bag your own groceries which is not super bad esp if they don't have to pay someone to bag your groceries to save money on food and esp if you are like me and like the groceries bagged a certain way. 
My other fav thing about this place is the bulk food section: a wide variety of candies, nuts, powder products (soups, cheeses), dry grains- rice, beans, flours, quinoa; a pet section with treats and food, grind your own peanut/walnut/cashew butters, and a large selection of spices by the pound",2017-03-27 21:47:04

Often people ask me why I Yelp and share my experiences with the community?  Yes I love to devour food and I will travel across town and country to find places.  Places like this not only bring a new taste of food but they also can expose you to different cultures and unique flavors that you wouldn't get in your average shop or fast food joint, not too mention it's kind of in my back yard!  

When you consider Mediterranean food, look at the map and you will quickly see it is vast. There are regions throughout the Mediterranean that bring different flavors. This being said whether you go to Persian, Lebanese, Armenian restaurants most tend to share similar plates and although similar, each region has some different approaches to some of the oldest meals of time. Vegetarians this is the spot for you, all of the veggies are fresh and their hummus and falafel are too yummy. Meat lovers where you at? Do you like Croquets? Start by trying Kibbeh with beef, a great tasting appetizer that can fill you quickly but the savory taste and bite keep luring you for more.  You like marinated meats? Try their Kebabs which in my opinion have probably the best seasonings you can put on meat, the Kefta kebab is my bag. Finally top it off with some basmati rice (I like saffron) and before you know it you will be eating some amazing foods that you probably wouldn't experience unless you traveled to those regions of the world. Plus you get to take plenty home because it is a feast.

I keep coming back and order all different plates and frankly I have not been disappointed.  I like to read some of the reviewers comments to understand some concerns and there are not too many, perhaps the only one is pricing. You can always go to the Persian Room in Scottsdale and the costs are actually much higher and I will say for my neighborhood joint I am not too certain I am up for a 50 minute drive when the food here is very good. Mediterranean food is not cheap people, it requires plenty of love and prep time. We just had a meal for 3 along with some acohol and our bill was 61 bucks.. That is not too shabby if you saw the plates we had at the table. Please know when you pay for this food not only are you getting what you pay for, you are enjoying food from the hands of the owners that make this place special.

I encourage everyone to try new foods and visit Zeta's.  Be sure to ask for Nicholas one of the servers.. He's okay ;)",2016-08-05 03:38:33

I would say you should call, or maybe send a carrier pigeon or something that they can handle better than today's advanced technology.

Unfortunately I never got to find out how they were in an actual move because there were 2 different times when they supposedly didn't get what I submitted (both via the website and through email.)

I ended up moving my furniture in near record breaking Phoenix heat with the help of my parents who are in their 60's because they couldn't manage to set up a move for me.

My recommendation would be to make sure you either do things by phone to confirm that they have in fact received the information you have attempted to send, or to ask for a return email to verify receipt of your message. If you haven't heard back in a few hours, send another one and another until they respond. 

The first issue was with the website. I filled out the ""Inventory Form"" and hit ""Submit"". It then kicked me back to the company's home page, so I figured that was what it does when the form is submitted. I waited and waited. Several days later I emailed Lynette asking what the status was. She said she never received it. Awesome. Evidently the website didn't work properly, but there was no indication of that to me. So...if you hit submit, just know that you should get some kind of notification. I did it again and it worked. Gave me sort of a summary of what I sent so I could keep a record. That's nice, but when it doesn't work, there's no way to know that it didn't work.

The second issue was through email. I was back and forth a couple times with Lynette after the first issue, so I knew she normally responded promptly. I emailed to confirm that I wanted to schedule the move as quoted and asked at the end what my next step would be. Didn't hear back for a couple days. So I emailed again to ask about the status and again...she says she never got it. Well...it was sent via ""Reply"" on my side to an email that she sent me. It's in my stream of emails and shows that it went through so I don't know what happened to it on her end. 

What I DO know is that by the time I emailed to inquire, they had booked up the time that had been quoted to me and she said she didn't have any dates available until a week after I have to be out of my place. She did add that she could do July 4th weekend but it would be at a higher holiday rate. I have to be out by June 30th, so even at a higher rate, I couldn't even consider that. 

You would think that maybe if you gave out a quote and hadn't heard back from the customer, before you book up the time slot you quoted for, you might call them and ask if they still needed it? That might be a great time to find out that you aren't getting emails that customers are sending for whatever reason. 

But I guess that would take 2 minutes so I guess that's an absurd idea on my part. Yeah...just book the time to someone else. The person who filled out the entire inventory sheet and did all the steps up to the part where you confirm and request a credit card number...that 34 year old chick who lives alone probably doesn't really neeeeed a mover. Maybe she was just throwing the idea around and changed her mind...decided to move her own furniture by herself in 115 degree temperatures. That's probably it. 

All those good reviews are nice. I wish I would've gotten to find out what a great job the movers could do, but due to more than one clerical error I didn't get to the actual moving phase with them.",2015-06-23 23:50:17

One time I ordered a personal hawaiian at Pizza Hut then waited in the KFC/Taco side where I decided to get a pulled pork wrap instead. What's great about this place, is that you can just abandon one place for the other two if one is taking way too long. It's fabulous! As I left the restaurant (they all share one entrance) I heard the Pizza Hut guy shout, ""one personal hawaiian!"" They key is to not make eye contact.

The KFC/Taco bell seating area is a hot mess.  Like, seriously.  There are hot sauce stains everywhere and the seats are all stabbed up from the local no-good nicks.  They have a fountain drink dispenser in the dining room which I think is kinda silly from a business stand point. I mean, this is Dufferin and Bloor for pete's sake, there shouldn't be THAT level of trust! I saw several tweens refilling their $1 Mcdonald's soft drink cups. 

The food, is everything you expect it to be so I can't complain.  There's never a shortage of Fire Sauce so that brings the quality of every meal up by 34%.  You will be surrounded by tweens at peak hours in the summer. Other than that, everything else is ""a-ok""

Because we had already had drinks and a taste of the awful pizza there, we weren't all that hungry, so we decided to stick with shawarma sandwiches - lamb for me, chicken for Mr. Cluck, 9.95 each.  Even so, we were served a basket of warm, puffy pita with some olive oil/balsamic for dipping.

Our server was Simi, a delightful young woman from Israel, who couldn't have been nicer, and didn't betray any annoyance that we were ordering so little.    

I loved that we were able to substitute salad, rice or broccoli at no extra charge, and we both went with salad.  It was a large portion, but simple - just romaine, tomato, cucumber and some seasoning, accompanied by a lemony vinaigrette.

The sandwiches were excellent, and we were given cups of extra tahini to put on them.  The pita had that extra bit of crispness around the edges that makes a sandwich great, and we both enjoyed our meals.

Khoury's is a large place, with cloth napkins and tablecloths covered with paper.  Only the lighting - too much, in my opinion - prevents me from thinking of this as an upscale place.  A little dimness would add megawatts to the atmosphere.

This place was rather small, and a result busy and we were told there would be a 45 minute wait at 8:30 on a Saturday evening. But fortunately were given the option to sit at the bar instead without any wait. 

We went with their basic salad, their veal parmigiano, and their spaghetti and meatballs. Their portions were massive! We couldn't finish their pasta dishes or all the proteins in the dish, and ended up taking it home - at least I had a nice decent lunch the next day! Not only there was a a lot of pasta, the meatball and the veal was massive. The fettucine in the veal was not quite right but the sphaghetti was definitely better. The pomodoro sauce was good.

Guy, I had not heard of the run, and I have yet to meet anyone that, prior to going to Big Jim's, has heard of The Run either(Except for my one friend's grandma). However, I'll not forget The Run - a small stretch in Greenfield near the South Side Works involving a baseball field that has housed this place since 1977 - after having come to Big Jim's.

Big Jim's is full of cheap,largely-portioned food that I think is characteristic of this area. Little flair, decent flavor, no funny business. Enter and take your pick of the dining room or the bar area. There may be a wait(I've been here once or twice with a line out the door, mostly during games. Go another time and you're good to sit just about anywhere). The crowd is a good mix - neighbors, locals, Pitt students. The menu is a selection of mostly fried appetizers, sandwiches, hoagies, some Italian specialties, and pizza. 

My favorite item to get here is definitely the veggie hoagie. So simple: Good bread, provalone cheese, brocolli, cauliflower, onions, peppers, carrots, thrown in the oven until the veggies are roasted(Add mayo for me, of course... And sometimes a little ketchup :). This thing tastes amazing, and while I could probably down a full one, I prefer to share it with a side of some kind of appetizer. The spaghetti here is also pretty good, and I've had the eggplant parmesian and it was decent. The entrees will net you garlic bread and spaghetti and a salad, large portions of everything, so don't attempt them alone.

Now all that being said, I do have a few gripes about this place - Number one being that the service is slow. My order usually takes about 20-30 minutes to come back to me, which for a hoagie is kind of crazy in my opinion. The staff is friendly and it's hard to get upset, just don't come here for a 'quick' bite. My other gripe is that while some of the menu is definitely home cookin', other parts of the menu are definitely not, so buyer beware. My girlfriend ordered the applesauce once($1.50) and about 15 minutes later(but well before the rest of our food came) the waitress handed her a generic plastic cup of applesauce, not even opened. I mean come on, at least put the stuff in a dish.

But what are you gonna do. The veggie hoagie is too good to pass up. Just accept the stuff for what it is, and don't try and go on the edge of this place's comfort zone. Stick to what they do best and you won't be disappointed.",2011-06-30 13:54:55

A great place if you want some chinese food but want a step up from the usual 'cantonese tea canteens'. We had the house special drunken spare ribs, fish soup noodles with seafood add-ins and a wok fried hor fun. The spare ribs along with chunks of taro were crunchy and tossed in a sweet vinegar sauce. It reminded me of a good sweet-sour chicken dish without the bright red food coloring. The fish soup noodles was a great hit at the table, especially with the add-in options of large shrimp, house-made cuttle fishballs and real scallops. The broth was creamy white with a nice kick of spice at the end. I think the broth was the winner for the day. Also, the little yogurty jello thing comes as dessert on the house. 

We sat on the round stage under the disco ball and lighting track, making the whole table wondering what this place morphs into during the night-time hours. The décor takes a moment to get use to, with the dark intimate lighting, glowing colour-changing lights and a backdrop wall of fish tanks. It's like a traditional chinese tea shop got smashed together with a disco nightclub and had a restaurant as a child. Weird but interesting.

Ugh....Where do I begin? If you get a server named Jilani, beware!! You may want to ask for someone else. I usually don't name employees who gave bad service in my reviews, but this guy made me angry! We came here on a Sunday afternoon. It was perfect timing because we had just missed the lunch rush and it wasn't as crowded. After the hostess showed us to our table, we waited for 15 minutes until our server finally showed up. What annoyed me was that there was another couple that was sitting right next to us and arrived after we did. Yet, they got serviced by Jilani first. A few minutes later, I overheard the hostess telling him that we came in first and have been waiting for a while. Thank you for actually noticing. He obviously sucks at keeping track of his tables. Finally, he stops by our table. No ""Hello"" or ""Welcome,"" just ""What would you like to order?"" We pretty much didn't see him until paying for our bill. Other servers, who were much more friendly, brought us our drinks and food. 2 starts for them! Jilani did not care to check on us while we were eating, nor did he offer to refill our drinks. After we were done, we waited for another 15 minutes until he finally showed up again and asked ""You want me to box that?"" No, I'm going to spend the rest of the day here staring at my 3 slices of leftover pizza. What do you think?! A few minutes later, he dropped off the pizza and bill without saying a word. I don't even know why I left him a tip. Although it was much less that what I would have left for a good server. 

Food: 4 Stars.
Not the best tasting pizza I have eaten, but still pretty good. I don't know if I came here on a off day, but my pepperoni pizza was a bit salty. I do like their crispy thin crust and fresh ingredients. Although once in a while, the cheese would completely fall off the slice.

There are plenty of bars with Sunday Ticket, and I've tried quite a few, but to find a place with a decent crowd is another story...especially in Southside. Based on the number of fans of other teams also pulling up their seats for a game a Archie's, I'm not alone in giving Archie's a thumbs up.

This past season, I finally decided to check out Archie's, as the other options in Southside had let me down, and it was a generally nice experience! The bartender was really nice the few times we were in, and the one time I came in and had to ask for them to turn the game on, Archie himself (assuming it was him based on the striking resemblance to the menu drawing) was super polite in putting it on the TV closest to my seat. Need I remind you, he was polite to a guy in a Ravens jersey. That's the type of service that will bring anyone back.

If you walk in expecting anything special, food-wise, you're asking too much, but the food isn't bad. It's exactly what you'd expect upon seeing the place, and after checking out the menu. My favorite thing on the menu is the meatball hoagie. It's actually good, and not just in that ""well, it's good for here"" kind-of-way. It was actually good stuff. The wings and chicken tenders are okay, but I'm definitely giving my positive food ratings to the hoagie.

The prices are reasonable, the food is decent, and service is good. It's not a place that I see myself frequenting when football season isn't in, but I wouldn't steer anyone away, either, as I imagine the positive vibes are a constant at Archie's.",2012-03-01 18:28:33

I was also not aware that Luci's had opened a second location just up the road.  And I was positively stunned when I found out where Luci's second location was built.  I grew up just a 5 minute drive from what used to be an old home with a fruit orchard on premises on 12th Street just north of Glendale.  The old adobe home is still on premises, but the property has otherwise been beautifully transformed.  Invited to join my family for brunch here on a Sunday, I arrived dazzled by the aesthetics, hoping the food would be equally enchanting.

If you were to do a mashup of LGO Hospitality's La Grange Orange, Upward Projects' Churn, and Fox Restaurant Concepts' The Yard, chances are you'd come up with something resembling The Orchard.  You can credit owners Lucia and Ken Schnitzer of Luci's Urban Concepts for transforming what was once a simple adobe home and fruit orchard into a complex of restaurants with an outdoor seating and entertainment area to match.  The Schnitzers have done a fantastic job of preserving and rehabbing the old adobe home on the property (now the Pomelo's space) as well as add a breakfast, lunch, and dessert space next door (Luci's and Splurge Ice Cream).  The outdoor seating area is a mix of shaded seating in the center with trees, grass, artificial turf, and even a splash pad lining the perimeter.  Plenty of seating for big groups with picnic tables, tables and chairs, or even on the brick walls lining the property.  Super family friendly and super dog friendly as well.  A perfect setup for the numerous Madison School District families that occupy the neighborhood.  I'm sure I'll give Pomelo and Splurge a whirl at some point, but today it was all about Luci's.

The Luci's space most resembles LGO due in part to all the knick knacks and collectibles you can purchase whilst waiting in line to get in your food order.  Order at the counter here, grab a number and they bring it out to you (whether you choose to sit on premises).  As this is a breakfast and lunch spot and I was right on the brunch hour (10am to be exact), I went with separate breakfast and lunch items.  For breakfast, their cranberry orange muffins looked heavenly (and huge) so I grabbed one of those.  Additionally I ordered a Luci's Burger.  A half-pound burger with greens, red onion, tomato, applewood smoked bacon, and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun.  Also got a side of fresh fruit.  Total cost for the food including tax came out just under $20.  Food came out in just over 5 minutes (despite a pretty full crowd).  The muffin was excellent, mixing in a little tart acidity of the dried fruits and smooth texture of the muffin cake itself.  The burger was also quite good, though I wouldn't say it blew me away.  True, sometimes a burger is just a burger, but it can also sometimes be magnificent (i.e. The Stand or The Parlor).  Luci's Burger is good, but not yet in the realm of magnificent.  Still, a tasty meal in a beautiful outdoor space.

Thusfar a good first impression from Lucia and Ken.  I'm eager to check out their flagship restaurant on 16th Street and Bethany Home as well as to try out Pomelo and Splurge next time I'm here at the Orchard.  It continues to amaze me how so much of my old neighborhood has been preserved, transformed and repurposed.  And for the most part, its local restauranteurs who are leading the charge with mostly positive results.  The Orchard is unquestionably built to last for generations of families in CenPho looking for a tasty, comfortable respite close to home.  The Schnitzers saw the property's potential and most certainly realized it.  Bravo!",2017-12-04 19:52:27

After my girl Olive left, I stopped driving from Cotswold all the way out there for my waffle fix.  

I've gone to the Piedmont location now at least 10 times and once I stupidly brought seven friends.

For starters, their staff is rude.  Unhelpful, unfriendly and the one girl can't make a mocha from toddy, milk and chocolate to save her life.  This same girl served up 8 burned waffles to my friends and I.  She said she had turned the waffle iron up too high and was scraping everything off.  Every single waffle had a layer of black on the bottom.  

Another visit my waffle was mushy and slightly gray inside.  I also do not believe they put the additional sugar on the waffles as these compared to Ballantyne are decidedly less sweet and crunchy.

Secondly, the atmosphere is totally different.  It's very cold feeling and the music is way too loud hard rock for 8am.  Ballantyne is warm, great music and you could sit there for an hour relaxing.

The last time we went we found out that  the locations are not owned by the same owners as Ballantyne so we couldn't use our punch card there.  BAD BUSINESS.  So, in addition to being the subpar location you also wouldn't honor a frequent guest card?

I was here for dinner one night, and the sandwich I got was unbelievably bland, so was the side of cole slaw. The artichoke dip was ok, but very greasy. The pasta a bit dry and bland as well.

The reverse happy hour concept from 9PM-11PM is cool. There is an OK number of beers on tap. The service is friendly and efficient.

However, the food is sub-par, so I won't be returning even if I were in the area.",2012-11-07 19:03:57

Meal:  Between the four people at dinner, we had the Kentucky Fried Quail, Kobe Beef Short Ribs, seasonal daily shortbread (couldn't remember exactly what it was), vintner' salad, collard greens, tatter tots, and the mac n' cheese.  Oh, and we had a ton of cocktails.  I think every person at the table had at least 3 drinks each.

Taste:  Real hit or miss.  Somethings were just off the charts in taste and freshness and some things were incredibly boring.  The cocktails were wonderful and it was apparent they use top shelf stuff.  The mac n' cheese was a real let down.  The collard greens were decent at best.  The quail was good but nothing to write home to momma about.  The beef short ribs were top notch, along with the short bread.  I would think the way to go is to go with whatever is the ""daily special"".  7 out of 10.

Value:  Value was horrible.  I understand that the intent of nicer restaurants is that they don't typically serve huge portions, but at the same time, if you drop $150 (without tip), you expect to be full afterwards.  Don't come hungry because you will leave hungry.  The best value was probably the short ribs. 1 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  I liked the service because our server knew that menu inside and out . . . and she was not shy about giving us recommendations.  I like a server whoisn't afraid to share their opinion and directs you away from a potentially bad dish or experience.  Out server was attentive, funny, and friendly, but at times as a little pushy.  9 out of 10.

Atmosphere:  This is a great atmosphere.  It overlooks the city-scape and architecture design is beautiful.  It has a very young yet sophisticated feel to it, but almost any age demographic will fit in.  5 out of 5.

Overall:  Next time I come here, I would probably just come for the drinks and get a small appetizer instead of a full meal.  The atmosphere, drinks, and service is what really makes this place stand out.  I think this would be a great place to meet someone for a date or if you want to go somewhere upscale prior to a concert near by.  22 out of 30 points, 3 out of 5 stars.",2013-01-03 21:38:58

It's basically happy hour, but it last all day :). I really love this place. I've become a Sunday HH regular here. I can't believe I didn't go here sooner in my whole time living here. The house rolls were half off, appetizers were half off, and the drinks were half off as well.

My favorites here: For the signature drink there, and I did a fair bit of sample them, was the Blue Berrymore. It was a nice drink on a nice summer day. I enjoy their house rolls. The Geisha A Go Go roll was delicious, wrapped in their ""Geisha Green"" soy paper with a jalapeno sauce. The Gaijin roll, a specialty roll here, was yummy. It was an interesting take on a chimi, topped with their chipotle sauce made it super yummy. I really enjoyed the calamari here, again paired with the chipotle sauce for dipping, and the teriyaki ribs, which were so good and tender. The fried rice is really yummy as are their other apps. The ones I mentioned are just my favorites and ones to try. The apps here are a good portion size, unlike some other places, where you can actually share with people.

Look at the website the paper menu is half the size  and the ingredients listed just look like squiggles. Also on the website the left end of the menu is cut off and you can't see all the ingredients in the salads. 

 I thought the ""Hippy Grains and Kale Salad"" actually sounded really good. Mixed Greens, Kale, Bamboo Rice, Wheat Berries, Lentils and I think Orzo and some other stuff. I thought with all the stuff in it I really wanted it healthy and I thought I didn't need the orzo filler added to it. So I asked the worker if orzo could be not added to my salad and she said, ""what is orzo?"". I tell her it's the rice shaped pasta. She still doesn't understand and gets another worker and I ask her if they can leave out the orzo and she also ASK ME ""what is orzo?"" and tell tell her and she doesn't have a clue. I thought maybe with the fist worker it was a language barrier since she had an accent but the second worker should have understood me. 

It's a possibility that orzo isn't in this salad and it's in another  salad I saw but I know I saw orzo on the board where you order. My husband wanted to leave at this point because he didn't think I should have to inform them on what one of the ingredients they use are.

IR5bMIyyq5irbLy_a9ebqw,B5FTjNWSgkAQ9UjOKVjGhw,a7zF4dDTeswXZGmohBDbJw,4,1,0,0,"Only one review? I thought this place was pretty popular. Regardless, I came out for the Live Band 'Punk' Karaoke. Once a month, Howlers is host to a band which plays about(Just over, and increasing monthly) 100 songs. Write your name on the whiteboard and they'll call you up and play your pick, provide backup vocals, and your own goofy stage banter. You just have to stand there and do anything from get stage-fright to rip your shirt off and roll around on the floor singing. I put punk in quotes, because you shouldn't expect to come here and listen to The Ramones and Germs all night - they have a fairly loose definition of what punk is including Pixies, Devo, The Violent Femmes and more.(To be fair they do in fact advertise the New Wave part).

I knew prior to going that there was a $3 cover, so I headed in prepared at around 11pm(There are nightly 9-11pm specials as well - $2 Yuengling bottles that night) and I could hear Mission of Burma being sung through the outside window. Walking in, you can tell that they allow smoking, and people were indeed smoking, but for as much as there was my girlfriend and I really didn't notice it while we were there. Maybe they have good ventilation. There was nobody at the door to take our cover, so we walked right on in and ordered beers. They have East End on draft, two of those ran me $11. The bar is split up into two sections - The bar and the 'stage' area. You can watch the stage area on TVs in the bar, and the sound is surprisingly isolated.

We walked to the stage area which is where they took our cover - sneaky, but I like that. You can still come here without paying if you don't want to, just stay in the bar. Also, the first 40 or so people get a token(coaster) for a free domestic or well drink at the bar - which we got(and later traded for tall PBRs) - so that made everything totally worth it. We sat to watch the karaoke, each table has a one-page list of songs that you pick from. If you want to go, write your name on the board and they'll call you up when its your turn (IE no DJ to pocket-veto your request). Next to the stage, a line-up of $1 Seagrams shots.

I have to say, it was a ton of fun, and I didn't even get drunk and sing(Although I wanted to sing, since there were definitely a few I knew by heart. [I got a.. I got a broken face, uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh ooh]). The list of songs is short and hand-selected, translation: You know what you're going to get. For me, it's perfect, I love this kind of music, and I don't have to worry about hearing an awful interpretation of Adele(and hell, punk music is meant to be sung poorly anyways). The band is quite good, and a lot of the singers were great too, everyone had a sense of humor and some got really into it.

Again, I didn't really notice the smoke even though people were definitely smoking. However when I got home my clothes had definitely become casualties. The place probably wouldn't make sense if it was willingly non-smoking, but still, that's my only complaint about the night.

GRILLED OHIO LAMB BURGER
w/ stinky cheese fondue, champagne shallot, olive-dusted pommes frites & tangy yogurt

The bun is a soft and buttery brioche bun (from local Cleveland bakery ""On the Rise""), the meat is good quality and cooked medium rare and the fondue and shallots pretty much put the burger over the edge. It was damn incredible and I could barely put this thing down.

The pomme frites are served in a paper cone and are beautifully cut and seasoned. There are bits of garlic, salt, red pepper, rosemary, and a tiny bit of lavender. There is a yogurt dipping sauce on the side.

Caramel & sea salt

I knew that I would enjoy this one. I appreciate hot buttered popcorn, including this classic: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popcorn_(instrumental), buttered popcorn flavoured Jelly Bellys, and a healthy dose of both pop and corniness. As a tangent on this tangent (just call me scatty chatty Natty), one of my best friends is convinced that liking popcorn is a totally female thing. What a little pop psychologist he is with that kernel of wisdom...

Anyway, enough of this poppycock! Back the review.

The gist of the favour profile is smooth caramel corn, salt and butter from movie popcorn and those special half-popped roasted kernels that you hope to find at the bottom of your bag. Bonkers.

It took a while for our order to be completed. In the time we waited for our take-out order, we should have enjoyed a Halo Halo. However, we were too stuffed from our lunch. The food smelled fabulous as we watched various dishes delivered to different tables.

When we finally tasted the Pancit Beehoon, it was okay. The acid from the lemon was too strong for the subtle flavors. They gave us a generous portion.

Las Vegas is quickly becoming the best pizza city on the planet . Sure some would argue New York, Chicago etc. But, Las Vegas gets the best Pizza places from every city that migrates here and opens up a shop. Bruno's is one of those shops. Here is a classic 1970's pizza place that understands that you need great ingredients to make a great pie. The best dough, a unique flavorful sauce , great cheese and toppings. Everything is top quality. The guy below who gave a 1 Star review doesn't know what he's talking about. First , who would dare talk smack about free pizza brought to their work. But to talk smack about what is easily one of the top pizza places in Las Vegas. He must be a hater for sure. Ignore his review . Trust me and the others on here . This pizza place deserves a visit . The people who live around there should be rejoicing . These are owners who care about their product and customers . I came in with my two kids and they brought us out cinnamon rolls on the house . Bite squad delivers and I'm sure Postmates will too. Pizza lovers you need to come and try this for yourself . 


Helpful advice : 

My only advice to them would be to carry more rare and hard to find bottled sodas and root beers. Those would warrant the price you are asking . Or lower it a buck. Just my two cents",2015-10-25 22:37:38

I've stayed in their rooms and they're nice, clean, large rooms. It was during the summer, so we got to check out the pool, I liked it, but for some reason it was really cold. The hot tub was nice, lots of room for everyone and you don't have to be supermodel or gym rat to feel at home here.
We've eaten at the Michael's Gourmet Room, the service was great but the food was only average, especially for the high prices.
I've had a quick lunch at the Big Sur Oyster Bar...clam chowdah wasn't bad.
The morning after we stayed at the hotel we had the casino Breakfast Buffet, thank you coupon, it was okay. It was food, it filled the need.
The bingo hall is large, good entertainment to kill some time, the number callers could use some work, but they have the electronic board to help. Free drinks while you play, although the waitresses don't come around often. The room can get smokey too.
The bowling alley is large as well. Good prices for cheap fun.
We've been to the showroom to watch a band and another time a comedian, the room can feel small, but it works.
The arena is good for concerts, horse shows, and other various events. Check out the free events they have, we went to a Dog and Horse show which was a lot of fun.
I've been to a party in one of their banquet rooms and the food was good, very nicely done. I forgot I was in a casino.
One of the reasons we keep coming back is their movie theater. Multiple screen theater, usually not too crowded except for holidays and when a big movie is released. Staffed well, the other movie goers are usually pretty considerate of others, but there's always someone that needs to check their cell, repeat every line, laugh at inappropriate moments, or forgets to put their phone on vibrate.

BHcjSZnFKHIJQowKM-Hdrw,QFSek24a9vAOy1VQpvZhYw,EWj6tgNVl9x8Z7u9nnqdwQ,4,0,1,0,"I'm smacking myself for knowing about Workshop for over a year and not stopping in until recently. 

Workshop is located inside the Grand? Theatre. Is ""classy-rustic"" a  descriptor? Because it is what I would use. Not a ton of seating but the space is used well. Workshop has a pretty robust lunch menu, but the Lougheed Lunch (3 courses, 25$) caught my eye. 

I started with a cream of artichoke soup, served with a piece of pancetta and Parmesan. The soup was well balanced without too many overpowering flavours. My only complaint was that the artichoke pieces still all had the fibrous outer layers that are typically removed when serving artichoke hearts. My dining buddy quipped that perhaps it was intentional to ""help with my digestion"", but personally I'd prefer to stick to regular fibre sources. 

The main was phenomenal. the ""braise of the day"" was a brisket served with cornbread and broccolini salad. I'm always a little hesitant when it comes to ""brisket and bbq"" as I frequent Texas and am therefore a little sick of BBQ, especially when mediocre. However, I opted for the brisket and I was so wonderfully, pleasantly surprised.  

When you think brisket, you think tender, but you also think fatty in a sloppy, watery fat kinda way. Not so with Workshop's brisket - the meat was simultaneously tender yet not ""boiled to mush"" overcooked, with appropriate color and texture. The fat was present (it's brisket after all, part of the experience), but managed to avoid the watery fatty consistency many brisket iterations have the misfortune of having. 

Let's move onto the flavoring and the sauce. I am so incredibly over ""Brisket"" that has a 2$ bottle of superstore bbq sauce drenched on top and calling it BBQ. In fact I am so over the standard BBQ flavour profile regardless, so I was so excited to see that their flavour profile was a far departure from the dark oozy stuff one would typically expect. It wasn't even really a BBQ sauce - light, tangy, with bold flavour, but simultaneously not at all reminiscent of the bottled stuff.

The cornbread was also a wonderful surprise. I generally detest cornbread as the dry, flavourless crumble tends to taste like saw dust in my mouth, but rather than feeling as if my mouth was in a prison camp, Workshop's version of cornbread was light, subtly but well flavoured, and had a great texture. What a relief! 

Dessert was a fudge brownie, which I won't dwell on too much as it was too sweet for me but I'm a little bit of a princess when it comes to sweets so I can't hold it against them. 

Overall fantastic experience at Workshop. I fully expect this to be a go to lunch spot for me in the future.",2018-04-05 22:23:40

We were able to sample Some cookies and a mini coconut cream pie tart and s chocolate eclair. They have a lot of delicious sounding pastries as well as a variety of breads to choose from.

Second visit to C&A was for the the U.S.-Algeria game, and unless you are a hermit we all know what happen that game.  Epicness happened.  When Donovan scored that goal it was absolute bedlam.  It is was one of the greatest moments of my life.  What a great feeling to celebrate something like that with your fellow countrymen and women.  But just like the England game all I had was beer.

It wasn't until recently that I had the food.  I was in the area and decided to give the food a try.  And I'm glad I did.  I had the Fish and chips and they were good.

I ordered the drink of the day and my boyfriend had a beer. The drink of the day was delicious and I was happy that they weren't stingy with the alcohol.

We ordered three appetizers to share: the famous lobster poutine ($19), grilled octopus ($19) and fried cod and clam ($16). My boyfriend complained that there were very little lobster in the lobster poutine and I couldn't agree more. I think I took the only piece of lobster and he was left with the bits and pieces. The fries were decent but I think I like Deville Dinerbar's fries more (especially for that price point). The grilled octopus was also done well and wasn't tough at all. However, it was nothing special to my palette. The fried cod and clams was the the worst dish because all I tasted was batter.

The downfall of the night was when the host rudely confronted us because of a reservation confusion. We called earlier in the night to inform them that we would like our reservation pushed back and they nicely did it for us. Unfortunately, the person taking our call made two reservations under our name. That's why the host confronted us about the second reservation. I didn't see why he had to be so rude toward us when it wasn't our fault and the restaurant wasn't even busy (it was 6pm).

Overall, we had a mediocre experience and I expected more from this restaurant.",2014-06-29 03:25:31

I've had mixed experience with drinks (beer that had clearly gone off, but they were happy to replace it). If you're not here to play pool or snooker, you're probably better off elsewhere.

They have one snooker table, and a bunch of pool tables, both priced at $15/hour. This is a bit too expensive for pool, but a reasonable price for snooker. They do, however, charge for the full first hour (e.g. if you only want to play for 30 min, you'll have to pay for the full hour), which is not great. I'd also expect better quality of equipment from a proper pool hall - the snooker table is not precisely balanced, there are holes in the canvas, and the cue sticks feel a bit strange (it's hard to tell why, maybe they're too light?).",2017-09-21 20:21:21

The pizza bar is located at the bottom of the escalators next to the burger place. Get there early because if there's a conference or if it's busy, you will wait! Luckily I was able to order early before the crowds. I ordered to-go and decided to take my food back to my room.

I ordered the arugula salad and a slice of pizza. This meal was about $15 (yup everything in LV is expensive!). The salad was good enough to share for 2 people, but I felt the salad was really dry. I should have asked for extra dressing. The dressing was already mixed in, but I barely tasted it. What I liked about the salad was that it was fresh and not much filler. I wish there was more cheese and croutons or something crunchy other than the radish tasting veggie that topped the salad.

For my pizza, I ordered the meat lovers. The slice was eh. Nothing special. I wish there was more sauce on the pizza. The slice was small and wasn't filling. Wish I was able to get this pizza fresh and out of the oven!",2018-05-30 01:59:50
ZJZgv_gHtEKLhKSNN5z7Vg,Ry1O_KXZHGRI8g5zBR3IcQ,wMIHcDnQXGTIVwBnIDRwGw,4,3,2,2,"I am definitely a fan of this theater... especially since their Saturday Matinee price is just right:  $5.50.  It is fairly new, well maintained, and since I go with the early Saturday crowd, it is hardly busy - just the way I like it.

When I first saw the theater parking lot, I was a little puzzled, but it apparently a lot of thought was put into the plans since it is configured in a way that doesn't encourage ""those people"" who just park their cars in front of the theater to look at upcoming movie times.  I guess now-a-days with smart phones, the times are at our finger tips, but I do like how the parking lot makes it pedestrian friendly - especially since the theater is not stand-alone.

There are a number of restaurants and businesses located around this theater complex... Sweet Frog, Hickory Tavern, etc.  You can easily make a nice evening out of coming here without having to travel and park the car multiple times.

The theater itself boasts the typical, stadium seating... digital projection... and up-to-date sound systems.  There are small party rooms for birthdays and celebrations... heck, I would consider a small group outing to the movies or maybe even a meeting here.

Concessions always get me.  I know it's the way the theater makes money, but I usually make a clear decision whether or not I am going to get popcorn before the movies so I don't end up spending WAY TOO MUCH  just to grab a snack.  Popcorn is decent here and the self-serve butter station makes it dangerous (only tap that on special occasions)... wow - maybe I need to take that out of my review, but I'm going to leave it in.

Anywho... just being a fan of the movies and the movie-going experience, this place is a great to ""go to the movies""!!",2015-01-06 13:39:27

Their small pizza sans-outer crust was the perfect size for me.  I got the chicken, spinach with cream sauce.  It had a bit of sun-dried tomatoes and although I'm not a huge sun-dried tomato fan I thought that a little bit of it added a nice touch.  The thin crust was just perfect and had a slight hint of a smokey oven flavour.  I was a little disappointed that they ran out of duck and were not making their soup of the day, the two things that I originally wanted to order.

Their patio was beautiful, albeit noisy on this perfectly sunny day.  It was a true Toronto experience with loud trucks honking and traffic right beside the patio.",2014-06-30 16:07:14

Summer you get to sit on the patio in blazing sunshine watching the people pass on 17th while eating some delightful food. In winter you are in their cozy well decorated restaurant, eating the same delicious food!

Their fish tacos are my go to dish here. All ways fresh and tasty. Never greasy or oily. Light batter on the fish, with just enough topping to fill that delightful corn taco without it all falling out... mostly.

Service is very fast and friendly. Often just one waitress serving on their slower night, but they are all very good at their jobs. Kitchen gets food out as quick as possible and you can tell its fresh - if they are super full, it takes the kitchen a little longer but 100% ok with that for fresh food.

Great choice for breakfast items, although it is so hard to choose something other than the fish tacos. 

You can also order 5 options of tacos individually - so try them all. The pork one is super tasty.

It's a real gem. The staff is great (bar and table service), the fish is fresh and the rolls are fun and mighty tasty. In the past few months we've been half a dozen times. 

When it comes to rolls we prefer those that are spicy. Sexy Time Special, Kiss of Fire and Sun Devil are favorites. They are a must each and every time. We also enjoy the sashimi. The yellowtail is like butter. The screaming orgasm is a great alternative. We've enjoyed others, but their names escape me. Each and everyone is delicious, though. I have no doubt everything is well executed. So thankful, it's not AYCE. I much prefer quality to quantity.",2013-10-07 15:23:54

In my system 3 stars is the maximum score for a casual pizza place, since it's a very low level of difficulty establishment. That said, we were happy with our shared salad and meatball sandwich. The sandwich was made from a pizza crust, with sliced meatballs and a very spicy pepper - nice! It's an open, clean, loud dining room. The menu is limited to pizza and a couple of salads and sandwiches. There's also a surprisingly diversified by-the-glass wine list. Service was prompt and professional.

My first impression was that I had stepped back into time and that I was in the type of restaurant with a decor right out of the 70's. A traditional Cantonese restaurant decor. 

The food was promptly served and was delicious. Unlike the decor, the food is 'updated' and their lunch special are delicious. I had a Sweet and Sour Soup which was delicious and General Tao chicken which was extremely tasty and well prepared

I could not help but observing at other tables that many people were ordering the Whole BBQ Duck. This was presented and carved in very thin slices at the table. It was interesting to see.

I would like to return, for dinner as they still feature the old cantonese cuisine. I love Shrimp in Lobster sauce, and it will be nice to return to go down ""chinese food memory lane"". If its good enough for Anthony Bourdain in New York to do that, its good enough for me....

And before I forget, they have Fried Apples that are plunged into iced water....a treat!",2009-05-26 15:21:56

The spring rolls are really good and the sauce it comes with was perfect. The green curry with chicken had a great flavor. I only wish they cooked the green beans a little more.

To start off, don't expect good service. I gave this place a four star purely because of the food. The service here is like any other all you can eat places across GTA - the servers are always in a hurry regardless of what you are asking the server to do for you. So typically, when I go to any all you can eat places or buffet places, I don't really expect a high level of service. 

The food quality of the sashimi and food in general is so much better than a lot of all you eat places that I have been to. I like how this place has a few items that most all you can eat Japanese places don't have. I really like the steam egg. It was really good. They also have a pretty good list for deserts too. This is the only all you can eat place that I've been that offers steam ginger milk for desert. It was really good - very heavy in the ginger flavor. 

I would definitely come back for more. Next time I come, I think I will try a weeknight.",2017-02-20 21:39:45
