A lot of choices , a lot more compared to Osaka. The highlight was the beef tataki, salmon sashimi, sweet shrimp, the flounder, and the creme Brule. The rice/fried rice bowls were the perfect 2 bite portions as well.

The line to order wasn't too long, but I have heard it can be out the door some mornings. I ordered the smoked salmon omellet with a side of fruit. The omellet was stuffed an a massive amount of cream cheese and minimal salmon. I found the salmon to be salty and there was simply too much cream cheese that I had to scrap off a big chunk. The fruit was good and fresh.
I do enjoy eating outdoors when I come to Joe's, but I find myself trying to get away from bugs and making sure none fall in my food, so I may have to stick to eating inside.

I had the flat iron steak and the mashed potatoes...My steak was overcooked, but the mashed potatoes were pretty good. For a party of four, other things ordered at the table was a beet salad, sea bass, mac and cheese, a salad and the cast iron chicken. Everything was received pretty well, though no one raved about their meal. I think I just picked the wrong thing on the menu. 

The highlight of the meal was a side of bacon cheddar biscuits that were really good. I would 100% get those again. 

I'd come back, but the menu overall didn't speak to me that much, and I didn't have anything that really wowed me. Service was attentive, they were great with refilling drinks/waters as well.

We ordered the olives as a starter (they are all green and served warm) and were able to get some bread to accompany the reserve oil. 

Our server voluntarily explained menu items with important details like: it's ricotta gnocchi, not potato and the extra items in the puntanesca sauce (my recipe only has 7). We both had the orecchiette with sausage and greens. I found it to be a bit oily but the pasta was cooked well. 

He described the deserts perfectly and the chocolate bark with almonds was a nice finish with a second glass of nero d'avalo, and, by the way... I though the wine prices were very reasonable!

Work was paying so we came here. We were originally supposed to go to Casa Victoria? but they had a wedding that night. So in the middle of a snowstorm, we arrived early for dinner and I was far more impressed than I thought I would be.

The place looks like a gilded palace of gold, with multiple floors festooned with opulent paintings and chandeliers. Normally places that have such a precious decor don't have very good food. How wrong I was.

Our co-woker ordered for us Shark fin soup ( I know, I know), Peking Duck two ways, Fried whole lobster and Chinese Greens.

I had no idea what to expect of the soup, but the flavour was delicate and salty. I almost fainted when I saw that one bowl of soup was almost $70! Was it worth it? I don't know as this was the first time I've had it so I have nothing to compare. I liked it. Maybe too much.

Then a waiter appeared with a gleaming trolley upon which sat a golden roasted Peking Duck. He sharpened his knives dramatically and sliced the duck breast razor thin. The server brought a tray of thin crepes and gently placed a piece of the tender sliced duck and it's crispy skin on each crepe. Scallions, carrots and cucumbers were provided with a delicious homemade plum sauce. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven...DUCK TACOS!!

I know. That's really ghetto of me to liken their Peking Duck to tacos, but the reality is that I love tacos and I love duck. This was my new favourite food.

After shaving a few additional bits of duck and placing them in the crepes, they wheeled the duck off. What?? Where did my duck go? That was hardly the meat from an entire duck?? Whaaaaaa... Huh---- Oh, look... LOBSTER!!

Pre cracked, crunchy lobster in a sweet aromatic sauce. The Colonel has nothing on this finger lickin' dish!

Chinese Greens were dark and perfectly cooked in a sauce that had nary a hint of cornstarch goo.

And then.... the duck returned... as a Crystal Roll!

The rest of the duck was returned to the kitchen and diced with mushrooms, noodles and peanuts and served with giant leaves of iceberg lettuce for wrapping. The complimentary textures and temperatures were mind blowing. I never paid a lot of attention to Chinese Food as I had been assaulted for years with Lemon Chicken, Sweet and Sour Ribs and Beef Lo Mein. All of the sauces were always far too sweet and had the consistency of a bodily fluid that shall remain nameless.

These sauces had depth, texture and intensity and the ingredients were fresh and inspired. I was so caught off guard that it further enticed me to research all the dishes upon returning home and a pretty decent attempt at making them myself.

All in all this was the best Chinese Food experience of my life to date. I think the bar has been set pretty high for any competition.",2013-03-10 03:51:33

I enjoyed my brunch here very much! The inside is super cute and the backyard/patio area had its charm. The mimosas were ok tho - probably will not get it again when I come back. There was a long line when we got there but it moved fairly quickly. I do think they can do better with having an organized way of letting first timers know how it works.

Buzz has been good early and since all of the items are made fresh from scratch sometimes things run out.  However, we were still able to get a good sense of the place and definitely think we will be back.

We started off with the fried pickles.  They were in the chips and not the spears which isn't always my favorite but you can tell they were from a big bag of frozen items.

I went with two lbs of wings with their traditional Bobby Q sauce and another called Vampire's Kryptonite.  The traditional was very tasty, I wouldn't mind having a bottle of it at home.  The VK was a garlic and oil sauce which was not bad by any means but not for me.

The wife went with the chicken and waffles.  They were out of fried chicken but substituted the chicken tenders.  I will say these were some of the best chicken tenders I've had.  It's abundantly clear that the chicken is high quality and they are made fresh.  The waffles were also great and the cayenne syrup was a great topping.

The menu was set to change the next day actually so we will have to go back and try some of the old items that weren't available as well as some of the new.  I'm sure once they ramp up and work out all the kinks this will be a very successful place.  It's good fresh food and the prices are right.

That may sound biased, but imagine how you feel about traveling all the way to Santorini, Greece and ordering Moo Goo Gai Pan.

The issue I have with a place like this, is that the identity is muddled. Are you serving Japanese food, Chinese food, or Thai food? I mean, each region tastes O.K., but that's exactly the 3 stars review A-OK. Nothing spectacular. No punch in flavor and nothing to stand out.

Now for the bad the part the lineups for food/drinks are atrocious but thankfully I spotted the Amex Pavilion and decided to explore it. What a pleasant surprise no lineups for food or drink,s a nice clean area and the drinks were actually less than the other vendors. The Wine serving is a ridiculous 9 oz  and is the best value if you just want to get a buzz.  Getting here is a bit of a pain by TTC as one has to walk a bit from the nearest stop.

It was a really busy sunny Sunday in Leslieville, so the place was packed and we ended up sitting at the bar, which was not so bad.

I had a caesar (nothing special, missing celery) and truffled eggs. The eggs were amazing but my toast was burnt, and they put the eggs on the toast... so it's like they purposefully hid their mistake. My cousin and buddy Rob was kind enough to switch with me, as he is okay with crispy toast. Or, just felt bad for me. Anyway, with the toast done properly the food was delicious. Can't go wrong with truffles!

There is also a brunch manager or owner woman who is kind of bossy and rude to the employees but phoney kind with patrons. This aways annoys me, and any customer sitting at the bar would have noticed. Be kind to your servers who are working their butts off, it's not their fault you're miserable.

Kaya is attempting to pull off a high concept fusion style restaurant, blending Caribbean, South American, Pacific and Mexican cuisine into an appetizing blend of food. To be perfectly honest I am skeptical of fusion places due to the high rate of failures in execution. In many cases you have a young hot-shot chef who wants to be known as a bold flavor innovator, blending cuisines that he has never mastered to achieve usually poor to mediocre results. The dishes in many cases have only a vague similarity to the original and if it would be beneficial if the chef would stick to concentrating on the basics instead of cooking up bizarre fusion dishes.

Some examples would be the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Wings - which tasted nothing like Jerk seasoning should (loaded with allspice, heat of the scotch bonnet pepper, cinnamon, cloves, etc. Instead it looked like we had a dab of commercially bought jerk seasoning tossed on the wings after cooking. The wings themselves were cooked nicely, big and juicy but still had some pin feathers attached that were not removed, attention to details such as this is mandatory. 

For brunch I tried the eggs benedict with smoked salmon, the eggs were poached hard, again another detail that is unacceptable and sloppy. The salmon was cheap, the cornbread it was served on was good and made for an interesting combination but the addition of smoked paprika on top was okay, but nothing exciting. 

I could go on and on, but you see the problems.

It looks super fancy; however, at least with the early evening crew the dress code wasnt out of control.  We walked through the exterior seating area to get to the host, who for a second seemed like we offended her by not having a reservation ( the place was literally empty), but that was just for a second.
We were quickly seated and the waitress was amazing.  She was super knowledgable about ALL the gluten free options on the menu.  Nothing is labelled, but the waiters will take you through it and the gluten free-ness is rather extensive.  We ended up getting a scallop appetizer which though small in portion was a bite of buttery soft, yet crispy goodness.  For the main course we got salmon which had a wonderful crisp (probably fried in butter ha ha) exterior with a moist center.  They even had a gluten free creme brulee with a white chocolate honey comb artistic flair on the top.  All of it was excellent.  Now I know why it is always so busy.",2017-07-22 16:51:16

They also have a girl that comes to your table to do Sake Bombs with you. It's really a fun experience! As for the food, we had a family style dinner and here is what we had: edamame with some kind of delicious chili sauce all over it, rock shrimp which was SO amazing, a mixed fish tartare type of appetizer with chips for dipping, 2 really great sushi rolls, a sliced chicken dish drizzled with some kind of teriyaki type sauce and bok choy on the side, and assorted mochi, in which one of the flavors was cookies and cream and it was amazing!

I had written this place off after the first time, but they sent a flyer out in the mail and I decided to give it another go since I needed to get my car washed and detailed anyway.

When I got there, they were trying to sell me on a monthly package, and the idea wasn't unappealing since I like to keep my car immaculate. I just remember that during my last wash they had missed so many things on the inside, and was reluctant to commit to them since I had already found another place that did a perfect job.

The guy that I was speaking to asked me what was missed the last time and I went over the long list. He talked to the guys who were currently detailing my car, and by the time I got it back, everything was done just right. So I signed up for the monthly ($35/mo) because I thought it had improved.

Two months later and every time I go, the windows are wiped- but streaky. Whenever I drive at night you can tell and it's so obnoxious. Simple things are missed, like the metal detailing on my steering wheel which always has smudges on it after they turn my car over to me again. The space between the seats isn't vacuumed. My sunroof always looks awful. I'm going to cancel the monthly and return to my other detailing guys at Tivoli Village (have your car detailed while you're having lunch).

You make it quick and painless and I don't have to walk the length of 3 football fields from one end of the store to the other to hit the dairy, produce, baked goods and meat section.  

Another thing I love about you is that you don't clutter up the aesthetics of the store, or add another hassle to my shopping experience by cleverly stationing racks of impulse buys at the check out prompting my son to beg for various sugary delights.  

And the final thing I will miss is your mark down area.  While I have found that some items are still priced too high to be a real deal, the only place you lose a star, I've still scored amazing deals on fresh seafood, steaks, bakery items and so forth.  I will certainly miss that too.  

Tesco, please reconsider shutting down these stores, there has to be a way to make this business model work.

Although my primary residence is in Arizona, over the past couple of years I have found myself working in Las Vegas so much that my car rental expenses have come in at well over $600 a month on average,  So I decided to contact somebody I know that works at Findlay Chevrolet and see what kind of deal I could get. After several text messages, I drove out to the dealership and met with my friend, Jamaal McCoy who is the dealership GM. I met Jamaal at an industry event in Miami a couple years ago and we have stayed in contact since. Jamaal asked me to work with a salesman at the dealership by the name of ""Larry"". Larry was fairly new, but was exceptionally helpful and pulled up 3 2013 Chevy Camaros in different colors that met my equipment requirements... Right away i knew that I wanted the black one... very good looking car! When Jamaal presented the deal to me, including trading in a 2006 Mercury Mariner that I needed to dispose of for a relative that lives in Las Vegas, I was VERY pleasantly surprised. The monthly payments with no money down, and negative equity of about $1,200 in my trade-in came out to less than $375 a month. I smiled, accepted the deal and thanked Jamaal for his courteous treatment and better than expected numbers. After going through the documentation process, getting our complimentary accessories from their accessory department, a Findlay Chevy employee who specializes in doing vehicle deliveries took me through all the new Camaro's systems, Bluetooth set up with my phone and made sure I knew how to operate the vehicle... Away we went, in one of the smoothest and most aggravation free new car buying experiences I have ever had.

9/7/13 UPDATE: I dropped my 2013 Camaro off in the Findlay Chevrolet Service Department on July 18th for a routine 8,000 mile service and then went on a business trip to Washington DC... While in DC I was hospitalized and did not return to Las Vegas until September 4th. My biz associate called ""Slim"" my Service Advisor at Findlay and explained I was not going to be back for awhile due to a medical emergency. Slim stored my car for over 6 weeks and when I picked it up, they had washed and vacuumed it, as well as not charging me for the service or the storage in their secured lot. The only thing I paid for was an extra key, which was over $200 due to the key Fob security system and the programming required.  All in all, this is one of the best dealerships I have ever bought a car from and had one serviced at. If you are in the market for a new or used car, or need your GM vehicle services, I highly recommend Slim and heather in Service and Jamaal (GM) will set you up with the right deal in the sales department.  They even have a shuttle service to take you to home or business while your vehicle is being serviced, and then will pick you up when it is done.  I wish more businesses of all types had the customer focus that Findlay Chevrolet has.",2013-03-01 01:05:51

First, its not in one building. You have to check in at one building, and then locate your room in another building.  This doesn't work well if its raining.  Also, each building doesn't have an elevator.  This doesn't work well with people who have mobility issues or people with disabilities.  The hotel does offer help with your bags but I'm not the type to want to wait for someone to deliver my bags when all I want is to settle in, rest, and not be disturbed.

I booked two rooms using my Hyatt points (many months in advance).  I assumed the rooms would be right next to each other.  I assumed wrong.  Our rooms were located in two different buildings.  Initially the room assignments weren't too bad.  Despite being in different buildings, they were across from each other and shared the same parking lot.  However, after visiting one of the rooms, we realized it smelled of cigarette smoke (which should not have since this hotel is supposed to be non-smoking).  Thankfully the hotel had one available room left (which we switched to and it did not smell like smoke) however, the room was in a building much farther away than the original room assignments.  

Other issues we had with this hotel were that the dish liquid bottle in the kitchen was half used and the dish detergent packet was already opened and used.  There was mildew in the shower.  We turned off the fan/AC but the air was still blowing into the room.  And the door to our room did not completely close (see picture).

The positives of this hotel is that they offer free breakfast (in the building with the lobby).  They also offer non-down blankets.  We requested non-down blankets and Edgar was super quick to deliver them to us. We received fantastic service from him.

If you are a Hyatt member looking for a full kitchen, then this hotel would meet your needs.

My sister and I initially set out to try it during Restaurant Week for the $30 prix fixe menu. We both decided against that menu and went straight for the regular menu and opted for the $44 Chef's Tasting. What a great concept and a terrific way to try many different dishes. Although I must admit, next time I'd do it a bit differently because it ended up being entirely too much food -- even for this chubby girl.

From the killer atmosphere to the ridiculously stellar service, the meal I had at the Greenhouse was among the best of my life thus far. 

I was able to sample 8 different dishes thanks to teamwork with my sis. I won't comment on all of them (nobody really cares THAT much) but I'll just say I enjoyed each dish tremendously. Standout dishes (and those that I want to eat again RIGHT NOW): 
- Crispy Hominy w/ pork shin cracklings, pickled red onion & lime juice.     
- Maine Lobster & Scallop Quenelle w/ tomato coulis & parmesan.
- Crispy Chicken Wings Confit w/ roasted jalapeño, lemon juice, scallions & garlic.

Tables on top of each other so close you can hear everyone else's conversation... Entertaining as that may be perhaps save the fancy wood slat ceiling and put in something acoustic to absorb the sound of too many people in a small space. 

Tried all the steam buns... Pretty good actually. Confused why it was called pineapple duck confit - - - Nothing confit about it, it was deep fried... Perhaps cooked confit but definitely was finished deep fried. Flavorless. Seriously disappointed. Not screwing around or exaggerating...we really really really were expecting something special based on all the talk about this place. I had braised short rib...hard to mess up right? They give chopsticks so you should be able to eat every dish with chopsticks. Wrong. So tough on the outside I had to bring in reinforcements and use chopsticks in one hand and fork in the other. It was a cute presentation of a hot meat over the top of a cold potato salad... Ya hot over cold.... Dumb not edgy. **If you want a ""wow factor"" short rib dish go try Beau McMillan's at Elements at Sanctuary....hot meat over hot side

Their cocktail menu is cool, creative... Probably what's keeping them alive since the bar was full, drinks were good, and the price was same as an entree.",2017-11-14 22:10:42

We're over there all the time because Desert Ridge is so difficult to navigate and such a food wasteland.

Maybe we were hoping for too much. I'd never heard of Egg 'N Joe before and thought it might be locally owned. Unfortunately it's just another franchise place. To me I found the menu to be somewhat limited, especially when it came to  the skillets. When I saw pictures of the food on the menu it was a big letdown. 

Eating here reminded me of going to IHOP or Denny's when I thought we'd get a North Scottsdale experience. the food just isn't that great. In all fairness it's hard to hit the benchmark for me which is Butter's or Butterfield's in Scottsdale. They are the absolute best and you can get just about anything you want. If you're in this neighborhood and want a decent breakfast I would go to JJ's Delicatessen first.

Decor, it is nicely decorated and has a lot of seats inside.  If it is cold out, do try to sit further inside if you can because the door can get a bit drafty if it is windy outside although the curtains do help.

I got the cream of leek soup which I thought was good, the walnut salad was nice, the steak was done just right and the sauce is very good along with the fries included and to finish, the dessert was great.

Price, the full menu was $30 which consists of soup, salad, steak and frites and dessert.  I thought it was good value for the price.

Last night was my first time trying Ginko based on my friend's recommendation. In case you haven't heard, the head chef reserves a handful of seats at the sushi bar in front of him where you essentially are served a tasting menu until you can't breathe. There happened to be two spots available at the bar, and after speaking with the manager we occupied those seats for the rest of the night :)

EVERYTHING the chef put in front of us was unbelievable. Just an excellent selection of sushi. We must of looked like complete morons giving the chef thumbs up every time he presented us with something new, but we didn't care. The food was outstanding and so was the sake selection. Again, this option is only available if you are sitting at the bar in front of the head chef. 

Keep in mind that this place is all about the real sushi, if you're into the whole westernized maki dishes with fried shrimp and covered in wasabi mayo Ginko might not be what you're looking for. 

The experience we had yesterday is known as the 'chef's table' and you will pay a hefty fee for it. Next time I am in the mood for sushi I will try the food of the regular menu just to see how good it is but after last night I have very high expectations!",2015-08-01 19:25:50

The place was fairly busy and although we did not have reservations, we were seated without having to wait. We were a group of 3 and the restaurant was the suggestion of one of my dining companions, who has been here several times, and recommended it as she ""loves"" the place and it's in walking distance of her condo.

Myself and my partner were not so equally impressed.

The food is not authentic Mexican fare, but more along the lines of Tex-Mex...which is not a bad thing if you go in expecting to get Tex-Mex food. I had hoped a place called La Mexicana would be a bit more authentic, but hey...to each their own.

They start you with some tortillas and salsa (a creamy version, not a chunky kind that most people are used to). They were fresh and tasty.

One person ordered a pre fixed meal...soup, entree and dessert. It was reasonably priced at $20. The waiter came back about 5 minutes after taking her order to let her know that they were out of what she ordered, but he did offer her other more expensive options and would still charge her the pre fixed meal. Nice recovery but still....

Soup was Potato/Cauliflower, entree was a Tamalita (sp), I had no idea what the dessert was...looked like a creamy rice pudding. She liked it, which I suppose is the most important thing, as it was her meal.

Two of us each ordered the Sample Platter....it was $16 and contained: salad; black re-fried beans in a tortilla shell; enchilada (covered with a slightly spicy red sauce); shredded beef burrito (very, very, very, bland); and a cheese quesadela (sp).  It was good, not great. Everything was fairly bland other than the chicken enchilada.

Decor is ok....however our table was uneven and ""rocked"" whenever it was touched. Drove us crazy as we're ""elbow resters""...

Looking for something to do on a slow Saturday, we decided to give Bloom a try after a friend had visited and had some positive things to say.

We walked in and immediately realized this is a regular kind of place.  Two rows of leather seats were situated down the center of the room, with all the guys focused on the NFL game that was on at the time.  The owner quickly got up and welcomed us in, so that was a plus.

I told him that this was our first time there and that I had seen on their Facebook page that they were running a deal for a free cigar if you gave the ""password.""  He immediately perked up and was excited that we had seen the promo...  quickly escorting us into their absolutely massive (though patchwork) humidor.  After picking out a free Olivia G and a few other cigars per his recommendation, we went to check out and hit the road...  only to be told that they had a ton of ribs and cornbread in the back of the room for customers and that we were welcome to stay, have a smoke and relax.  Why not!?

Surprisingly, the ribs and the corn bread were incredibly good, and the owner stopped over to our area a few more times to ask how we were enjoying ourselves.

Overall, we left Bloom oddly satisfied.  I can't put my finger on exactly why (maybe it was just good timing, a good experience and the ton of cornbread in my stomach), but I definitely plan on returning.

Could the place be improved?  Sure.  It's not somewhere you'd take your mother (or your girlfriend/wife) if they're bothered by cigars, bathrooms w/ certain pictures on the walls, and a manly burlesque clutter everywhere...  but maybe that's part of the charm.",2014-01-10 13:56:28

The rooms were sparkly clean and beautiful, and the bathrooms are huge! There is almost a full kitchen with cook-top and all, so if you rented a car or drove, you could easily run to Whole Foods and cook some meals if you wanted to.

I would definitely recommend this hotel. I have stayed elsewhere in Vegas, and though I do have other favorites, this is an extremely high quality hotel for a low price tag.

They are quite large, with many seats and booths available to the customer and nice Asian decor. I've recently visited Matsuda again and can say they're still a great AYCE restaurant, but obviously for that experience it is a $35~ price tag.

Service: Lightning speed. It was insane. Within minutes of ordering we got all our dishes in 10-15 minutes. The servers were in traditional Japanese wear and were very nice and attentive. What I didn't like was their new system of ordering (I haven't been here in a long while) where you have to go through this thick book and pull out pages and then write what you want. I feel like a long sheet or iPads are a better experience. Not a huge deal though.

Food: I don't eat fish, so I can't comment on the sashimi, but it seemed like my friends liked it. It looked fresh and appetizing. Most of the food was very delicious and I was in heaven. One of the highlights was the Golden Shrimp. Soooo good. They also have a lot of options for every kind of eater, not just sushi and fish. As always, dessert time is one of the highlights of every Matsuda dinner, where you order over 20+ little cups for 4 people and it's a sight to behold.

The dinner however left a bit to be desired.  I mean, they used tortilla chips from Safeway, and couldn't substitute their pinto beans for black beans.  What kind of Latin restaurant is this??  

Also, the chicken torta was extremely greasy and gave me the burps the rest of the night.  And I'm not one with a sensitive stomach so it caught me by surprise.

As disappointing as our trip to The Dump was, coming here was a major plus.   While I was sitting in one of the chairs searching Yelp for lunch, I found my bookmark of Los Taquitos. Thank you, Lord. I promise to stay out of places like TD. Promise. 

I vaguely remember an episode on DDD where Mr Flavortown recommended this place. What I do remember was Guy Fieri visiting a Mexican taquitos place that had five sisters making some great food from a family recipe.  I hadn't put it together until I was standing inline next to the spray painted ""Guy Ate Here"" smiling face (photo).

Here's a challenge. I dare anyone to find a place like Los Taquitos serving up as delicious food for the prices that you can find here. My Street a Tacos (see photo of their el pastor, el pollo and carne asada) were only $1.29 each and were outstanding with just the right amount of heat. And, my friend's el pollo burrito meal for only $6.99, which included rice and beans, was equally delicious. 

So we enjoyed this trip to Flavortown and yes, Los Taquitos is a Four Star Bomb. Now do you think they'll miss a couple of squirt bottles of their red and green sauce?  Yes, Lord I'll put them back. Ugh.

For veggies, there's a decently sized sections of basics - burritos a few ways, enchiladas, chimichangas. They were cool with me wanting something else, and seemed chill about substitutions of any kind, really. So I end up with a plate of enchiladas - two spinach/shroom in green, two cheese in red sauce. Flavors were fresh, sharp, tasty. Beans had a zing and weren't super heavy. Rice, very fresh.

The toppings (well, topping in my case) were pretty abundant which was good as well.

As of now I have to give my rating based on the last time I was here. I made a appointment for 6pm to have a Fill with Vincent. 

I arrived around 5:30pm hoping to get a pedicure before my appointment. The gentleman at the front said ""No Problem, pick your color"" I then sat down in my pedicure chair. The lady who was assigned to do my pedicure was ""Mama"" she was not overly friendly. When I told her that the callous remover was hurting my feet she proceeded to get offended by the fact that I didn't care how smooth my feet were if it hurt to please stop. Once we got passed that the pedicure went a long fine. Till the end when I asked for a design on my feet. She was unable to do any designs and told me to wait for Vincent. He had taken another customer in the mean time and was not available. At around 6:05pm I was told to just stay in the pedicure chair and he will be done soon.

Fast Forward to about 6:35pm. I was greeted by another employee named ""Tina"" who was shocked that I was still waiting. She brought me out water and really was the only reason I am giving them two stars at all. I tried to ask Vincent directly how long he was going to be and he gave the standard ""Five more Minutes"". When Ten minutes passed I decided I had enough and was going to leave but not before making a appointment for Saturday with Tina. 

I like this salon as its clean and they are the best of the salons ive encountered thus far since moving but I don't like waiting around till 6:45 when you close at 7pm and not having my nails done.

I don't blame Vincent as I know he got a customer who wanted really fancy nails. However I feel the shop manager/owner should have paid better attention to the needs of the customer vs the appointment book before assigning him a client. If they were going to run behind open honesty would have been more respected in my book. Since Vincent didn't seem to care one way or another if he got my business I am going to give Tina a try. We will see how she does and I will update accordlingly. So far though her kindness definitely won me over.",2013-06-08 00:51:18

This is really the only place like it in it's area so for that is it ok. I was really looking forward to the mac and cheese after reading a review and was really disappointed. The sausage was not bad but I did expect a little more seasoning in it or a smoker taste. I am not a sauce person, because I like the Smokey hickory taste, not the sweet, and they have very sweet sauces and rubs. The Brisket was very fatty to the point even the person that had lunch with me didn't like it, even though they like a good marbling. I personally hate fatty meat, so I didn't even try it. The guy cutting did do a leaner/trimmed pieces of meat for a regular that was ahead of us but did not even speak to us when he was doing our cut. The pulled pork was dry and like the sausage could used more flavoring. I am not sure, but I think they use an electric smoker which could be why the meat didn't have that think smoked flavor I am use to with good BBQ. 
Overall if you are crazing BBQ at lunch and want a place that doesn't really have a wait, try this place out. However, I don't think I will be back.",2015-04-19 17:27:49

I entered the place and there was about 30 people eating or waiting for their orders.  You order at the counter and you are given a ""beeper"" that alerts you to when your order is ready.  I ordered a beef burrito with a side order of refried beans.  I explicitly said I was hungry for refried beans and would like a large serving.  I also ordered a drink.  My total was $9.00 and change.  I filled my Styrofoam cup from the drink station and picked up my plastic knife and fork.  I was alerted that my order was ready in a reasonable amount of time and when I went to pick up my order, there was a lone burrito in a plastic basket lined with a thin paper and aluminum foil.  I asked where was my refried beans and they said they put them in my burrito.  I explained that wasn't how I ordered it but I would go ahead and accept it the way they fixed it.  My burrito was 90% beans with very little beef and a little sour crème and chopped tomato and onion.  Eating a burrito from a  plastic basket with plastic utensils on a sheet of foil is one of my least favorite ways to eat.  There were two squirt bottles on the table, one with red and the other with green sauce.  I try and give new places the benefit of doubt as I want them to succeed and I struggle with giving negative reviews, but it is what it is.  It's not the places fault but there were 3 different tables where children around the age of 4 or 5 would scream as loud as they could to either get attention or show their displeasure and the parents did little to teach them that behavior was not acceptable in a public place.  I was glad to get out of there quickly as parents not controlling their screaming children is at the top of my least favorite things.  I think that after getting my order wrong, that the  burrito was way over priced,  and serving food in a foil lined basket with plastic utensils, is what I have to say about Frijoles and Frescas.",2018-01-27 20:26:03

We first entered the bar side through Treasure Island. As we were planning on having dinner, we were stumped by the lack of tables.

I ordered the 8 oz. flat iron steak with sides of two-cheddar mac and cheese and buttermilk whipped potatoes. The steak was cooked beautifully to medium rare and the mac and cheese was wonderful. The potatoes were decent but could have used a bit more seasoning. My boyfriend had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with french fries.

I really like the use of local, seasonal meat and produce.  I really like the changing menu, with a few items that change, while most vary.  I like the variety of menu items and styles.  I like the vegan and vegetarian options.  I like the generous pours from the bar.  I like the friendly, attentive service.  I like that this is a high end dining experience that you can go to dressed casual and act casual.  It is not ostentatious.  It is fun.
I suggest you get the four course deal for $44, saving one course for dessert.  The devils on horseback are great, but the seasonal salads do no disappoint, either.  If you are adventurous, try the fifth quarter, which is their daily appetizer special.  Usually creative and amazing.  They have the unusual pig's head (yes, half of an intact pig's head) and Fred Flintsone short rib.  Both of these are pricey, but meant to be shared.  Their oxtail risotto is amazing - tastes better than it looks or sound.  Their daily specials are great.  I am not a person who likes their fish cooked with the skin on, but they have converted me.  If you are not adventurous, you can order a burger and fries.  Be prepared for a generous portion of meat on a flavorful bun done to your specification.  If you have a large group, order the bread board.  It is worth it for the variety of breads and spreads you will receive.
Then there is dessert.  The buttered popcorn pot de creme is as addicting as any illegal drug.  You can't stop eating it.  Other items are just as great.  Their pressed coffee and fresh tea help to complete your dining experience.
So if you are looking for a steakhouse, don't come here.  If you are looking just for a burger and fries, you probably will be left wondering what the hype is all about.  If you are looking for mainstream comfort food, this is not the place to go.  If you are looking for a unique dining experience, with great service and well prepared food in a casual environment, this is your place.

Tonight's experience was extra special because of the waiter, Michael and chef, Colton. Michael was very attentive and polite, there were 2 kids at our tables around 10-12 years old and he had the perfect attitude for them! Nobody was ever without a drink and he went to each male at our table when we were eating and very politely and quietly asked if our parties were satisfied. He was raised to respect women and it was very obvious. 

Colton was amazing! So many reviews about it not being a show and I've been to some Benihana where all you see is a beating heart of rice and an onion volcano. Not with Colton, he incorporated a show with everything he put onto the grill. A personal favorite, ""who ordered the egg roll"" as he rolled the egg off his tool onto the table. I'm sure he was a little extra for the kids but he had me giggling the whole time.

Close to my office, and offering lunch time hot yoga, I was interested in giving Iam a try. Me, along with a couple of co-workers, bought a recent deal and were eager to try the studio out. I have now visited once a week for about a month and I think I can give an accurate review.

First of all, Gorgeous studio, exceptionally clean and spacious with four showers. Spacious practice room (although I did go to one class where it was actually packed.. maybe 50+ people?) nice light filled lounge and really friendly staff. Good Vibe.

I have to say that after trying a couple of instructors, Bruce is by far my favourite. PLEASE MORE LUNCH HOUR BRUCE! He is warm, welcoming, soothing, and provides perfect direction. If he taught every day at lunch I would be a constant visitor. Unfortunately, on the recent schedule, Bruce teaches mostly in the 10am hour, or too early for me. His classes are prefect for ""hot"" - just the right amount of challenge and flow, not too much to overwhelm me in the heat over lunch. 

I really like this studio, and its an EXCELLENT location for me, so I will for sure be attending regularly. My only complaint is that the Wed and Thurs Core Flow and Detox Flow are a little too much for me to handle during lunch hour.  I'd like more regular flow, or hatha flow classes during that time.

I am no expert on Ethiopian Cuisine,but when the chance arrived to meet up with The D's(David and Debbie) who have dined here on more than one occasion, I decided to give it another go. David's sister and her husband also joined us, so with our party of 5, the best thing to do with their 13 item menu was go with the meat sampler and the vegetarian sampler so we could try a variety of things. We also got one of their Tibs offerings as well.

We also tried an Ethiopian beer which was pretty good ,and I guess Ethiopians take their coffee seriously as we were sat next to the area where the coffee ceremony takes place which would have been interesting to see, but we were the only diners and we came for the food, not the coffee. I love the opportunity to be able to eat with  your hands and this is one of the few places in town where your hands are the silverware. 

Our meal arrives on a huge silver platter and our waiter also disperses the Tibs in small piles onto the platter so that it is accessible to everyone. The smell of the Injera reminded me right away of San Francisco Sourdough and it also does have a slight tang to it due to the fermentation process the Injera batter goes through before being steamed. I loved the flavors of each item I sampled,(Lentils, Collard Greens, Green Beans, Lamb, a Beef Jerky type item, a smoked meat one, etc.) but my favorites were the Lamb, Tibs, and Spicy Lentils. The salad was nothing special with Italian dressing on top, and the cheese looked like Feta, but tasted more like a Queso Fresco. The prices here are very cheap too.  Came out to $10/person, tip included.  Can't wait to come back!  ALOHA!!!

When checking them in and checking out the room ( I've never stayed at Venetian,  enjoyed a weekday jaunt at Palazzo but never hit the mothership ! )  their room was in the Venezia Tower which means it's stones throw from Bouchon. 

 Sadly, my buddies aren't the foodie types (as an example,  my one friend enjoys the coffee shop at the wild, wild west casino -  ok, I like it, too.) but I figured , tough cookies, we are gonna hit Bouchon for brunch and they are gonna like it !!

Saturday brunch at Bouchon after a late nite of Vegas ""activities"" is  a welcome reprieve.  Even though the restaurant was busy ( about  1/2 hour  wait to get a table ) the overall vibe is relaxing.

We decide to start with some pastries and of course, COFFEE ! We opt to have the server make the selections for us.  A raspberry  coffee cakish pastry, a chocolate croissant, a regular  croissant and the server brought us complementary what I'll call, mini -  beneights .  I went with the croissant - perfect ! tried a little nibble of the others, again, amazing !  and the coffee, I'm not a coffee snob, in fact, basically started drinking coffee when I moved to Vegas, this is definitely one of the better cups of java I've tried.

My two buddies order the same thing( I gave them a glare hoping they might order different items for the sake of variety ) - the chef special omelet ( it had sausage in it - I believe Italian ) I went with one of the other specials - the crab gratin.  My roomie ordered the french toast with a side of bananas.

Sad to say, the only pic taken by my roomie - the gratin. 

The omelet's looked perfect and given the 30 seconds it took both my buddies to inhale them, they tasted good, too !
The french toast -  I'm sorry, it ain't ""french toast"" it's french toast ""inspired"" bread pudding !  It does taste great but my spin - it's a dessert.

The gratin - amazing flavors but very rich.  It has a very heavy cream base to it.  I was completely stuffed but I had to try a lil nibble of the mini-french baquettes provided with our breakfast - I wish I was still hungry because the bread was simply devine.
The service - impeccable.

Although for a first timer, the menu may seem confusing, just go down the list and ask for help when needed. Hummus reminds me of a Mediterranean Chipotle. Everything is prepared in front of you and looks very fresh.

I recommend getting the bowl to start because the servers load so much into the bowl that the wrap usually starts falling apart. The classic and spicy hummus are the two popular choices and are placed at the bottom of a nice treat as you dig in. I picked the black lentils for my grain, which I enjoyed. 

When it comes to protein, the braised lamb is a popular choice. Unfortunately for me, they were at the very bottom of the tray for the night so whatever I got ended up being very salty. They ended up topping my bowl off with the roasted vegetables, which was appreciated, but I didn't enjoy how salty the meat was. As for the grilled chicken, I thoroughly enjoyed this protein and would recommend this in the future. It was not dry at all, and very flavorful.

As for the toppings, load it up as much as you can! Too many olives can make things too salty as well, but I love olives. As for the sauce, I love tzatziki, so that was an obvious choice for me. The pita fries are crunchy and go wonderfully as a side to share.

Well imagine my surprise  when I found about the Coach House... plus the fact it is about a 12 minute walk from my place! Happy, happy, joy, joy!

Ah, seems I get excited about the small things in life but yeah, I digress, I was pleased to find a nearby breakfast place that serves a decent, well priced breakfast like at Johnny G's but closer.

The Coach House definitely rolls 'greasy spoon' old school, as there is something very late 70's, maybe early 80's about this place. Most likely the semi-retro, yellow and dark wood decour BUT... not in a hipster kind of way. Oh no, far from it, you are more likely to get a road dinner vibe than a Queen Street West one, which for me, is a good thing. If you see someone wearing 60's glasses here is because they are actually in their 60's and not just being ironic. Damn hipsters. ;-)

The meals come out hot and with no BS: Eggs, meat, bread, coffee...  no superfluous fancy names or attitude. Just good portions and a tasty breakfast to boot. Service is good, attentive and the prices are fair. 

Really, this place is a small hidden gem and when I mean hidden, I mean it. None of my friends knew about this place --that is, until I told them. 

Heck, I have over the years walked by the Coach House countless times and for some reason, I always kept thinking the place to be a bit sketchy and so I stayed away... oh, was I wrong. Not sketchy at all.  

So if you are in the hood of if you are looking for a great downtown breakfast joint to try, definitely give the Coach House a try.",2013-04-24 15:14:44

This one person was dealing with a line of about 15 customers while more than 6 other apple employees stood around.  There were a few other employees working, but literally 6+ were just standing around chatting with each other.  When I incredulously inquired about this with our greeter he paged to have someone else come check people in, which was appreciated.   Once we were checked in it was a 2 hour wait to return and check into ANOTHER line, see a service person, and finally an hour wait to have the screen actually fixed.  The whole ordeal took the better part of the afternoon.  It seems like for all the streamlining and user friendly-ness that apple boasts this place could be much better managed.

They balance their time well between the folks getting coffee to-go and those who order to sit down.

They have plenty of baked goods on offer (including some Sweets of the Earth cupcakes if I spotted correctly?), but I was happy to keep it to just me and my latte. 

Last notes - washroom (downstairs) includes changing area for babies in the Ladies; free wifi too (you need a code). It's a good location for the neighbourhood, but I might be sad if this were Toronto's only Crema.

Shiso Treet Cafe is located in J-Town, between Victoria Park and Woodbine Avenue on Steeles. There will be a crosslight between the two main intersections, so turn in there

In J-Town, there is a supermarket, including a bakery and a few little small shops within that supermarket. Several other restaurants there including Izakaya Ju, and some cafes. There is a small garden with a fountain in the middle, which gives a really nice vibe. The area is actually pretty small and pathetic... and I wish we had formed a bigger area for J-Town in this location!

After failing an attempt to come to Shiso Tree Cafe the previous time, we made sure to come in before they close for dinner time.

Dropping by for lunch, their lunch menus consist of salad, soup and a choice of entree. Shiso Tree Cafe is known for their pasta, but also has choices like chicken katsu with rice, salads, udon, and Japanese fusion poutines.

Salad came first, nothing special but I do like the sauce that came with it!

The soup was served in a cup, not a bowl. So serving is relatively small, but it was fine since the price was so cheap for this amount of food!

I'm not sure what this soup was as the waitress just plopped it on the table with no indication of what it was. To me, it tasted like it had potatoes and beets in it. The soup was just decent but I'm not sure if I would ask for seconds.

My Shoyu Mushroom pasta came first and it looked absolutely yummy! The serving bowl was in a good size and I liked the type/style of bowl they used.
My Shoyu Mushroom had different types of mushrooms and the sauce was more watery than the Carbonara sauce which helped made my pasta slurpy and I liked that. The sauce wasn't overpowering, plus both the seaweed and mushrooms added a bit more flavour towards an potentially bland meal.

Each of the pastas came with bread but I didn't touch it at all because it didn't look that appetizing~

L ordered the Carbonara pasta, which came shortly after mine.
The Carbonara pasta came with bacon, egg and parmigiano reggiano cheese. It just tasted alright to me, nothing special. Carbonara is always a safe choice in any pasta situation in my books. But I much prefer my Shoyu Mushroom pasta.

We also got a poutine to share!
This is their Japanese Poutine which consisted of dashi gravy, cheese curds, green onion and nori (shredded seaweed).

It sounded just like a regular poutine with slight tweaks but it tasted better than I thought.
The dashi gravy is actually pretty light compared to some other restaurants where the gravy is really thick, heavy and clumpy. I like the dashi gravy better.
Whereas the nori gives it a slight differ in taste, and a slightly crunch along with the fries.

It is a different take on regular poutine but I like it more because of how light dashi gravy makes the poutine. It makes it easy to keep eating more without feeling sluggish.

For a weekday lunch, each meal set came with salad, soup and a choice of your entree (not including the poutine, haha)... This entire meal cost about $8-10, and for this much food, it's such a steeeeeal!

Without the poutine, I was satisfied at the end of the meal, but not full. Perhaps I was really hungry upon coming here, but the poutine made me full and happy.

I would definitely come back again just to try out more of their pastas, since they have a variety of them, and even maybe another poutine since they had some really intriguing flavours.

PS: They close at 2.30PM, after their lunch period and reopen again at dinner time, which I think is about 5PM.

If you know any more places that sells similar foods to Shiso Tree Cafe, let me know!
I love this combination of Japanese/Italian fusion. Or any relatively cheap and casual pasta places would be great to know too! :) !",2016-09-22 20:11:35

I don't claim to know what a typical experience at Patron is like, but I think this place deserves a glowing review for how they handled the large birthday dinner we thrusted on them. 

+ We had a reservation for around 20 people, and while I promise we are each wonderful as individuals... we can border on obnoxious when together as a group. Luckily, they seated us in a secluded corner of the restaurant at long chain of adjacent tables that managed to fit everyone. They are not low on space here.
+ As people trickled in over the course of maybe 40 minutes, the servers let us take our time to order and were incredibly patient.
+ Constant supply of chips and salsa is dangerously addictive. We never even needed to ask for more; they would just restock as we finished them. 
+ Food came out in a very reasonable time, with delicious and hearty portions for all. Honestly, after all the chips, my boyfriend and I were able to split a Patron Fajita for one and it was completely satisfying.
+ Servers were always polite, whether asking how things were or gently nudging in to take plates away. They also brought extra tortillas, extra plates, hot sauce when we asked.
+ Very accommodating for dietary restriction changes to meals.
+ They were able to split the check for each person like absolute WIZARDS (even accounting for items like margarita pitchers split 6 ways). That alone is pretty amazing, if you've ever been through the awful math of bill-splitting in huge groups.
+ Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get.

My friend and I got the most basic Las Vegas package since we're hungry but obviously not capable of eating a feast by ourselves. It was $45/person and the amount of food cannot be more fulfilling. You get the tradition side dishes + a house salad, along with rice, sauces and miso soup to go along with your proteins that includes beef, spicy chicken, garlic shrimp and pork.

You are however required to cook things yourself comparing to places like Honey Pig when a server would occasionally stop by and manage your food. The place wasn't busy at the time we were dining so the servers volunteered to rotate our proteins for us as we were engaged in a deep conversation catching up on life- What a nice touch. 

The ambiance of this place is on the smaller size but comfortable at the least. The service was friendly and attentive and most importantly, the food was amazing for the price that you're paying. I wasn't sure if it was Happy Hour when we dined but when we received our tab, it only came out to be $55.

Top 1 Seafood BBQ Bar Restaurant is trying hard and have some identity issue.

Decoration here is playful with a mix and match of Asian and European flare. 

Lighting was dark and bar like during lunch hour made me a little confused as I stepped in thinking I went to the wrong place? The lunch special menu did offered me some comfort.

3 items to choose from ($8.95 and up) or you can opt for the Mix and Match Noodle Set ($8.25).

My Cold Noodle ($8.95) comes with a gooey tofu egg drop soup, a spring salad and mango pudding. The noodle dish itself though plentiful but a little bland in taste.

Mix and Match Noodle Set is A-OK with a choice of dessert. The honey yam was meh though.

Almost all the dish has a little work of art as part of plating. They were kind of cute.

Top 1 might be one of the most lavishly decorated Chinese restaurant in the area but in a little awkward way.

I've had the curry, sushi bento, and tonkatsu bento lunch specials, and they were...decent. There was nothing I couldn't finish, but I have had a better version of each at other restaurants. The sushi had an odd texture when I tried it and was my least favorite of the specials, and I feel like it was a bit ""fishier"" than comparable sushi joints in the area. The tonkatsu bento was my favorite, with everything crispy and flavorful, and I love the miso that comes with their lunch specials. (It comes with what I can only describe as a ""seaweed medly"" and the different textures are quite pleasant. The food looks absolutely gorgeous, and the portions are just the right size, however the taste just wasn't the most memorable for me. My co-workers love the place, though, so maybe I just haven't hit the right menu item. I will probably be back, and definitely update the review with another star if I find a favorite.

The atmosphere is a little odd. It strikes me as sort of ""west elm"" catalog, which isn't bad, just unexpected from a thai/japanese place, and really, a restaurant in general for me, and the jazz soundtrack reminds me a bit of Richard Cheese songs. That being said, it's very cozy, with nice, squishy chairs, and I felt quite comfortable and welcomed. 

The wait staff is awesome, and put up with my fussy co-worker admirably, and even let me know about their free-thai tea with yelp check in. The price is right for lunch at around $10/person, but for me, the food wasn't enough to take it from ""A-OK"" to ""Yay!"".",2013-11-21 03:49:04

I remember my first time going to Flamin' Crawfish when they were at their old location. I love the MyTeas and you can even get a fruit and milk tea in one now with a split cup. 

I'll start off with the Flamin' Banh Canh. I do recommend getting this, since you rarely see many Vietnamese restaurants have Banh Canh on their menu. They broth is very delicious and the crab legs are fun to eat and drenched in broth. I believe it's supposed to come with shrimp patties, which I got none in my broth if I remember correctly. There is TOO MUCH broth however. All you see is liquid and it's like fishing for fish in a steep, murky pond. There is a lot of oil in almost everything though. 

On to the seafood! The crawfish was overcooked causing it to be mushy and easily breaks the meat into small pieces. I got the $44.99 special and was notified that there was no blue crab left (which I noticed as a common theme throughout my experience here). The Flamin' special sauce is a little sweet, but once again, a fountain of oil. Maybe get bread to dip in the sauce. 

We tried to order Chicken Banh Mi to-go and they were also out of chicken like they were out of blue crab. Does this happen every day? As a foodie, hearing someone tell me they're out of something makes me incredibly sad. I do understand that stuff can run out, especially seafood, but CHICKEN??? 

The meal ends with these coffee jelly desserts. The coffee flavor is very light and I'm not sure what the liquid is, but I think it's coffee creamer or maybe some kind of sweetened milk. In general, a very innovative idea! 

As one of the only seafood broil spots in Charlotte, if some improvements were made, I can guarantee it will be a big hit in the years to come.",2017-08-03 18:38:57

Kuge wasn't able to make a review while Kan Pai was having their all-you-can-eat specials at the end of 2010 and at the beginning of 2011.  Come to find out they no longer have AYCE sushi has crushed The Great Ones spirits but he will overcome and will give his fans what they want, a fair and honest review.   Kuge would like to point out when they had AYCE it is hands down the best AYCE in Las Vegas.

Enough about that, Kan Pai deserves 4 People's Eyebrows out of 5 for the following reasons.

- Something Wrong 69, Ban Ban Roll and Candy Cane roll are incredible rolls that Kuge would pay good money for and now since they ""lowered"" the price of some of these rolls since they are no longer AYCE, the value/taste ratio is sky high

- Fresh Fish, not once has The Champ was givin non-fresh frish.  He LOVES the fresh water eel

- Friendly Service.  Maybe Kuge is fortunate to have the fast and helpful teenage waiter, but he hasn't had a problem with them.

- Iffy Speed of Service - Sometimes The Great One and his friends have to wait a long time to get their sushi, other times they could get their sushi right away.  But it varies and it's not even dependent on how busy the place is at the moment with raises a few eyebrows.

- Regular Rolls are okay - Kuge has tried several rolls from Kan Pai and the great rolls he mentioned above are the best value any roody poo could get.  But more of the standard rolls he orders aren't memorable and for the value you get from cost/taste, isn't great.

Kan Pai can make really great sushi at a reasonable price, if you don't mind spending a couple dollars more on the special rolls, Kuge will GUARANTEE you won't be disappointed...

I drove down a side street looking for a parking spot and lucked out about 2 blocks away. I paid $3.00 to park for an hour, which I suppose wasn't too bad for the area. I ordered the 3Guys, which happened to be on special for the month. Score! It was really good, and I regret not getting a second one before leaving. Downside was that the tables were filthy and the place was pretty busy, so I guess they had to focus on making drinks over cleaning up after messy guests.",2017-05-06 00:38:33

I haven't been here in many years because I moved to San Francisco, but having been in town recently, I decided to take my husband there. I was hoping it was as good as I remembered it to be, and I was not disappointed. 

We made reservations ahead of time since it was a friday night, but even still - the restaurant was not packed and we would have been able to be seated regardless. 

We started off with some drinks - my husband had beer, and I had a glass of their house wine, salad and bread. 

For appetizers, I ordered the garlic shrimp and he ordered one of their calamari specials. For the meals, he ordered a swordfish special and I ordered a 26oz stuffed lobster tail special. Dessert was flan and espresso for my husband, and I got the chocolate mousse. 

The appetizers were excellent, perfectly cooked and quite a large portion. The sauces were excellent and they came out quickly. 

The entrees were phenomenal. When my lobster tail came out, I literally got a standing applause from the table next to us. It was *enormous*. There was so much lobster, I actually had a doggie bag of lobster to take home. I've never tapped out on lobster before that day! 

The desserts were okay. The flan was quite good, my husband is hispanic and has high flan standards -- he loved it. The chocolate mousse left a lot to be desired and really didn't have the airy, light texture. It was quite dense. 

They offer a candied liquor as an after-dinner drink that was lovely. 

It is a pricey dinner - the bill came out to be about 180 dollars and we tipped to bring it up to 250.00$. Its not something that you do everyday, but there is no reason not to make it a regular outing. 

The service is absolutely impeccable with attentive wait staff and knowledgeable employees who are very well versed on the menu. 

There is a pay parking lot next to the place, which is small and would easily fill up.  Valet would be a nice touch.

Get there EARLY, especially if it is a big game or a divisional rivalry.  I know that, at least for Broncos games, the bar will be packed at 10am for a 1pm game.  

So, it's not exactly close to the strip, or in the best neighborhood, but it is worth the trip if you are a diehard fan!  There is plenty of parking, since the bar is located in a Sunflower Market strip mall.  Make sure you wear your Chargers gear, or you will be out of place.  I don't remember ever seeing someone there NOT in a Chargers jersey or shirt...Except for once, we were there early for a doubleheader MNF game and there was some DB in a Jets jersey, but that is a story for another day....If you wear SD gear, you will get a raffle ticket for the halftime give aways.

As for the menu, it's bar food, so it's not gourmet, but everything I've eaten has been really good.  They have drink specials as well, usually on buckets of beer.  When I say that this place gets crowded - I mean CROWDED.  By gametime, it will be standing room only.  There are a group of regulars who have saved seats, so there is very limited open seating for non-regulars.  Normally this would make me mad, but I understand that the same people have been going to watch games here for years.  Maybe one day that will be me with a reserved seat! A girl can hope! :)  If you are lucky enough to get a table,  be prepared to share.  If there are open seats, the owner will ask if other people can sit with you.  I have met some really fun, cool people this way.  Because it is so crowded, the service can be a little bit slow.  Just order a bucket and settle in!  The best thing is that they have FREE food at halftime!  You heard me, FREE!!  They change it up, and there is usually anything from wings to pizza to spaghetti.  And a popcorn machine.  I can't complain when there is free food for fans!

As I mentioned before, they have giveaways at the half.  They usually have a lot of prizes.  We've won fridge magnets, cooler bags, t-shiirts, hats, etc.  They even give away jerseys!  All for being there and being a fan.  

This is a really passionate group of people.  There is even a guy with a mini canon who sets it off on all Chargers scores, just like at the stadium!

Warning: it is a small, crowded place.  If you are really bothered by cigarette smoke, this may not be the place for you.  But if you are a huge Chargers fan, it is worth a visit.  This is BY FAR the best Chargers bar in Las Vegas.",2011-11-14 08:35:33

I wanted to give them my money.  I was pretty desperate to buy a TV having moved into a bare apartment and was badly in need of entertainment/something to fill the gaps.   I had my credit card out and was my muscles were twitching ready to hand it over.  They ruined it.

My salesman (Umang?) was all sweet and helpful, lots of ""thank you ma'am""s etc.  He got the TV out.  We went to the register.  Then the pitch started.  I got 10 minutes of the Future Shop extended warranty talk.  He told me about how TVs were like computers these days, about all the things that could go wrong, about their no lemon guarantee, their in-home service, the disasters that surely would befall me and all my family and friends (fire, flood, pestilence, locusts...I think) if I did not agree to spend what amounted to 25% of the cost of the TV on their warranty.  He spoke so quickly my head was spinning and I was totally confused.  I generally make a point of NOT buying the extended warranty on anything other than expensive laptops but didn't know what to do.  I needed air and Google.  I said that I needed to think about it.  He was shocked ""what happened here?!?"".  I mumbled something about the warranty and he back-tracked saying I could add it later.  At that stage I was desperate to leave so fled.  He could have had a sale but instead I haven't even entered the place in 2 months.  Aggressive sales are the best way NOT to get me to buy something.  I later chatted with the guy in Tele City who said that the margin on cheaper TVs is so small that the stores make barely anything on them...hence the push for lucrative extended warranties.

They do have a good selection of products and all the brand names.  They often have good offers and sales.  My advice though?  Shop online or go in feeling ""fierce"" (ref Tyra Banks, America's Next Top Model) and having decided whether or not you want to hand over a wad of cash for a warranty.",2010-09-07 00:23:46

The guell tasted like a Spanish twist on Italian spritz... like soda water with some bitters and wine. Everything was great, can't wait to go back!!!!",2017-08-04 01:42:13

Affordable, massive portions of food, and decent/quick service. 

Get your Viet fix for pho and bun here. Two sizes of pho, regular and large. Both are massive and can be shared. 

The pork chop with fried egg and rice was delicious. 

Pho had tons of noodles and reasonable amount of beef

Spring rolls were awesome. Large and crispy

At the time they had a promotion where if you spent $12 per person, you get a free drink (only available until August 2018 I think). I got Thai coffee which was very good, and wife got lime juice which was refreshing, she found it sweet. 

Oh and very reasonable prices. Regular pho is below the double digit mark.

The egg roll is huge and lightly crisp filled with bean sprouts chicken and  other veggies.  The sauces are all really good.  Love the teriyaki chicken, recommend a spicy shrimp with broccoli which is a white sauce not the dark you normally get with beef.  BBQ Pork is a little hard, not always my favorite, but I'll eat it if it comes with my meal. Fried rice is all good, no matter the meat.  My favorite is the chop suey.

The restaurant is on the corner and you normally walk in through the back.  The inside is spacious and normally some oldies are playing.

We made our way inside and were able to find the row and seat numbers, though the latter was less clear. The seats are top notch, plush and reclining which was dangerous considering how I was tired already. But the movie kept me engaged and awake and the graphics seemed to be extra clear to me. 

I assumed ticket prices would be standard, even though I hadn't been to a theater in a while. So after I paid my friend I checked my stub and was surprised to see $14 listed. Yikes. Is it worth it?

There is no easy way to desribe where it is because you know how every spot in this mall looks the same. Best way to find it is to use the front entrance map and look for unit B35A on the main floor. 

I was really excited to try this place out. The dessert is visually appealling. While holding the dessert around the mall there were many people I saw thier eye sockets pop out and say what is that?

Matcha ice cream with honey comb and red bean mochi $6.95. It also had those Koalo cookies you find in Chinese grocery stores and a small waffle. The waffle tasted fresh and went well with the ice cream. There was alot of honey mixed with the ice cream which tasted good but it was overly sweet even for me. The ice cream tasted good but it wasn't really smooth like I thought it would be.

Twist ice cream (matcha and vanilla) with cotton candy $5.95. This one also had popcorn in the bottom of the ice cream and a chocolate waffle stick to hold the cotton candy in place. This one also tasted pretty good and worth a try. Once again the ice cream not as smooth as what I thought it would be.

Too bad there is no seating because you really need to sit down to eat this properly. We just ended up sitting at the side exits of the mall where there are benches.

Then you'll know. 

So, let's get down to the specifics of this deliciousness I speak of, shall we? 

Inside is pretty cool they have long communal benches but also separate tables, the lighting makes you feel warm and cozy and so does the BBQ aroma that hits you when you walk in. The music has been a mix of classic rock and current which jives perfectly with the atmosphere.
I only ever order one drink here, and it's called the green sleeve. It is a gin based cocktail that resembles a mojito to me. It is refreshing and delicious.

Now on to the main attraction, I know that's why you read all the crap before anyways... Ready? 

EVERYTHING IS AMAZING. The cornbread comes with this sweet whipped honey butter, the brisket melts in your mouth, the chicken is so dang juicy you can just eat and eat and eat.

If I could give 0 stars, I would. I flip this place off every time I drive past.

Don't ask me why my dear other half thought this was a good place to take a classic car, but he did.  

They charged $1000 for various things. 
I don't remember the details of part names, but here goes the original bill:
- $400 worth of ""It needs this, oh wait, no it doesn't, it needs THIS"", AKA replacing the same parts twice and charging for their mistakes
- $100 worth of useless bullshit
- $500 for a rebuilt carburetor, that had been rebuilt several times already. Why not just rebuild the one in the car? (An original part from 1969, and avoid after-market parts on a classic car!)  Oh wait, that would be intelligent.

He took the car home. The next day, it refused to start. Out of money, he let it sit quite a while before another attempt.

We took it to Whitey's down the road, who diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (um, what, that was replaced.)  They were correct though. So, back to Meineke we went, on Whitey's suggestion, to confront them.

Most auto parts are warrantied for a year. Or a certain mileage. Or something. This would have been within a year, and the car had been driven 10 miles since it was put in. A whole 10 miles. 

They were RUDE as hell, confrontational, and defensive from the get-go. They gave him the run-around about ""I have to call the manufacturer and call you back"", blah blah blah. The guy then began lecturing him on ""Why did you take it somewhere else?! That may void the warranty.""

I got pissed at this, and piped up  ""Why would he take it back somewhere that raked him for $1000 and plainly couldn't fix the issue? They only diagnosed it, they didn't work on it, so that doesn't void warranties.""

Of course this resulted in the nastiest glare I've ever gotten from a ""customer service"" representative, and of course the part wasn't under warranty after that.

I ordered a Take 2 Special with half a classic salad and half a Mediterranean vegetable sandwich for $8.  The order came within 3 minutes of us sitting down.  Another plus.  

The sandwich and salad were both really fresh.  The portion of the 1/2 salad was good.  The 1/2 sandwich was quite small.  I'd say the complete order of salad+sandwich was okay for women but only a snack size for men.  The coffee was quite nice, and it allowed unlimited free refills.  I noted that Second Cup's coffee across the parking lot was more potent.  

The interior decor was pretty and clean.  There was free Wifi without password.  The network speed was slow.

Now for the food.  This was probably the one of the worst Korean foods I've eaten in Las Vegas.  I didn't try the Hawaiian food or the Sushi so I can't comment on that.  I very rarely give out a really bad rating.  However, the food didn't taste authentic at all.  The banchan didn't taste right, all of them.  Kimchi is different since people have a different preference on how sour or fresh they like it.  However, the other side dishes just did not satisfy me.   The Soon Tofu was bland with a lot of spices.  The Mandoo Guk (Dumpling soup) didn't have any seasoning.   I'm pretty lenient on Korean food in Las Vegas, but this isn't one I could be lenient on.

My two favourite orders of all times are the egg soup (which is like steamed egg) and their spicy fried chicken (with the sauce on the side, because I can't take that much spice)!  They close late, and it's not far from where I live, so I ALWAYS come here when I've got a late night craving now.  

I tried to get creative one night and ordered their snowy chicken (see photo), but it wasn't worth the price, chicken was good, but it was like they sprinkled mac & cheese or popcorn cheese powder on top, not my thing.

Today I visited there for lunch and we had the ""all you can eat menu"". This menu is typically $12.95 on weekdays and $13.95 on Saturdays/Sunday and Holidays. If you pay cash there is a 10% discount though. They will ask you this just before giving you your bill. 

Having lived in Tokyo, Japan for 7 years, this obviously is not a world-renowned sushi spot, or for that matter, a star in the Toronto scene, but is a great local spot when you feel like some cheap sushi at lunch time... On a positive note as well, their Chicken Katsu wasn't too bad, as was the Yakitori. Wasn't impressed with the Crab rolls, but everything else was pretty good (salmon sushi, salmon/avocado rolls, tuna rolls, dynamite rolls, california rolls, red dragon rolls, etc...) - Squid tempura wasn't that great so wouldn't recommend ordering that...

My co-worker and I took our lunch break together after an appointment with a client and just so happens she loves Thai food as well.

When we walked in, there really wasn't anybody working but the kitchen people. Finally after just guessing to just seat ourselves that's exactly what we did. Maybe 5 minutes later a lady from the back came out and gave us menus. We inquired about them having any kind of lunch specials and was shut down really quick like ""No! No lunch specials here.. we too small for that"" I'm like huh?! okay girl whatever tell us what's good here then... She then said ""Other location have lunch special we don't"" Okay.. we get it no lunch special that's fine so tell us what's good here..

And to be honest, we didn't get to the restaurant till around 2pm... so not really brunch.  But nonetheless, who doesn't love sleeping in and eating brunch when you're actually awake right?  Though to the readers out there, when do you head out for weekend breakfast or brunch?  I'm curious.

Anywho, headed to Eggsmart that's located along Bay and Elm.  Eggsmart's been here for a while and on the weekends even at 2pm appear to be still bringing peeps who finally decided to wake up and meet up for ""brunch"". =P.  Nothing fancy with the decor, it's your typical diner that focuses on breakfast/brunch clientele.   It's a long restaurant and we were seated near the back.

Angela and I weren't really hungry but didn't wanna end up eating dinner late at night.  The waitress serving us was fast and efficient and wasted no time.  She was attentive throughout our whole meal and was quick to meet any of our needs, like a dropped fork. =P.  Angela ordered the Blueberry pancakes with a side of sausages and I ordered the Meat Lovers Scrambler.  The Meat Lovers Scrambler is essentially scrambled eggs with steak, chicken, bacon, cheese, onions and green pepper.  The wait wasn't too bad at around 10-15 minutes.  

Once the food arrived Angela as usually buttered up her pancakes and poured over a fair amount of maple syrup.  Gross I know right?  Or sugary heaven, I haven't really made up my mind.  The Meat Lovers Scrambler wasn't bad.  Pretty much what I expected, though if I'm back next time, I'm going for the sausage scrambler.  With the Meat Lovers, there wasn't a distinctive taste as it was lost in the wide variety of meats.  Both Angela and I liked the home fries and they weren't your typical deep fried taters.  It appeared to be the freshly cut, lightly seasoned and pan fried goodness that you can make at home.  The pancakes weren't bad, but nothing special. But the side order of sausage, they were overcooked and kinda dry.  Maybe it was getting near the end of breakfast.  Not very good at all.

Overall, Eggsmart isn't horrible.  It's your typical diner type breakfast joint.  Nothing really stood out and to me, this place is pretty much like Denny's.  Don't hate, but I prefer IHOP over Denny's ANYDAY SON!  So Eggsmart's isn't a horrible choice for the casual breakfast when you don't feel like cooking and it's close by.

We arrived at noon on a Sunday and it was 2/3 full. Good sign. We came here on a recommendation from a chef, so we had high expectations. We were not disappointed. 

You approach the counter and place your order and then you are assigned a table. They have a seasonal menu so I got the Llana Poblano Burger, with pepper jack and big pieces of roasted poblano on a freshly baked bun. My son got the Buffalo Bill with bison, bacon, Bleu Cheese and hot sauces, which was my second choice. We each ordered fries too. 

Our beers (huge) arrived in short order and Meagan took good care of us. Our lunch arrived 8 mins later. What excellent burgers!  Rich flavor, good balance of sauce-to-veggie-to-meat ratio. The fresh bun. Yum. The fries were cooked with spices that took them over the top.

When I was able to get reservations for that night (granted it was a Thursday) I figured it was fate and I had to stop by. I'm so very glad I did.

We arrived right on time for our reservation and were seated promptly. The waiter stopped by, took cocktail orders, dropped off some bruschetta, and left us with the oil board menu which is entirely in Italian. After staring at it for a good few minutes and taking pride in being able to identify a small handful of the items, the waiter came back to explain what it was we were reading.

We started with the caprese, which was done up very simply and exactly how I wanted it - fresh and not overly elaborate. For my main I tried the pork osso bucco. If you know anything about me it's probably that I love osso bucco; if I see it on the menu I'm ordering it. This was probably the most unique osso bucco I'd ever had. It had a sauce that was white wine based as opposed to red, and had a flavor that I wasn't expecting. Don't get me wrong - it was awesome, but just off center. My wife went for the veal meatballs, which were melt-in-your-mouth amazing but not in the least bit brittle. The one thing I didn't care too much for was the fact that the pasta that was served with everything seemed like more of an afterthought than anything. Granted with my dish it didn't matter too much, but it would have been nice to have had some great pasta to go with the meatballs.

After we were finished dining our service took a severe turn for the worse. We weren't able to flag down our waiter for a good 10 minutes after finishing our meals. Not to be deterred, we still went with dessert (wasn't going to let that affect our meal), and we tried the tiramisu. Simply outstanding.

I'd love to go back, and I'm sure this is a 5 star place. But the server disappearing for a solid 10 minutes and the pasta really do knock this place down one notch. But even still, my recommendation is still this - go! Enjoy!",2010-12-07 21:16:00

We arrived a little early for dinner, and there was maybe one other table in at the time.  We sat at the bar in front of the belt, and started watching the plates go-round.  Everything we tried was delicious... I tend toward California Rolls and didn't get anything much crazier than that, but I did try some new things that were very tasty.  As the dinner hour approached and the restaurant got busier, there was a noticeable increase in the variety of sushi on the belt, making me wish we had arrived a little bit later.  We were assured that if there was something we didn't see we could request it, I simply didn't know what I wanted until I saw it go by!  

I liked the fact that I could pick up food as I wanted it, rather than having it all delivered at the beginning of the meal.  This is why I tend to like buffet style meals where I have an ongoing variety.

First and foremost I used to come here quite often when they had their buy one get one free promos on Tuesday and Friday with the purchase of a drink, so I'm rating my review based on my experience compared to what it was before. 

They no longer have this promotion but instead, dinner on Tuesday is reduced to $15.99. The staff are the same, but some aren't there anymore. They did hire a few more people than before although the service was not the greatest. No one came to ask what drinks we wanted (until an older waiter that used to work asked), they rarely came to clear up our plates, took a long time to get the bill and return the change. 

Some of the food aren't the same either. They no longer offer the veggie dishes (king mushroom, zucchini, etc) they used to have, the ginseng longevity soup, spicy shrimp, roast beef, and lettuce wrap. The mango salad is like shredded mango with cucumber...taste wise, it was good but I prefer bigger mango pieces that they used to have. The sushi bar mango/cream cheese sushi no longer have the mango syrup on top making it quite bland. Moving onto the dessert, the variety of fruits they used to offer was what stood out to me compared to other buffets. However, they only had oranges, grapes, and honeydew. The ice cream was also a disappointment 'cause they used to carry 8 different flavours (that differ from other buffets) but now they only have vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and butterscotch. The cakes that used to be in the fridge and had someone help serve you is now lying ourself where I have to serve myself. 

They do have some new dishes but it just doesn't compare to what they had previously. I'm not sure if they're limiting food because they're charging less on Tuesday's but I'm paying about $2 more but with no drinks and less food. 

This used to be my go-to place but I don't know if I'll want to come back as often in the future.",2017-11-15 05:05:56

My friend and I shared the potstickers, steamed vegetarian dumplings, and the handpulled noodles with beef in spicy broth. The prices here are so affordable. The dumplings were much bigger than I expected but delicious. The potstickers in particular were juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside.

The place seems like it's owned and operated by a family, and the kitchen is semi-open so we actually got to watch one of the women making the noodles from scratch. What a nice touch -- and you can really tell when you eat the noodles too. I love the varying thicknesses of the noodle when they're handmade. The beef was tender and flavourful thanks to sitting in the broth, and the broth.............. SO yummy! Nice and spicy. I can't find the words to describe, but suffice to say I just ended up just dipping my dumplings in the noodle broth because I couldn't get enough of it.

Checking in for the first time we were asked to fill out some forms for our dogs, questions about behavior ect. 

Once the paperwork was done, the staff took Bri to the back into her own play area to get used to being there.

The staff then brought in a female dog to get Bri acquainted with being around other dogs. (She's a pup and only been around people) Once the two dogs said hello, they were taken off the leashes to get some freedom. 

The two females were then leashed and Bri was left in the play area by herself while the staff went and retrieved a male dog. This dog had Bri a bit nervous and she did not want to meet him. The staff were patient and slow with her and brought her back out after a Few minutes. 

The staff recommended bringing her back on a less busy day so that the energy in the play areas aren't so high. They also thought that she would be less nervous the second time coming back because she now knew that this new place wasn't the vets office.

hqJu8khw5VcTs2VYtTLREw,gwIqbXEXijQNgdESVc07hg,HkHTdTvzbn-bmeQv_-2u0Q,2,1,2,1,"I was intrigued by the concept for this restaurant, a place that serves Canadian cuisine. Hmm how does one capture the essence of Canadian take on food as the major cities are so cosmopolitan now its hard to pin point what that city is famous for. Sure there are pockets of ethnicity but unlike the countries of yore there aren't any cities I can think off that are famous for a particular dish (Montreal Smoked Meat  and bagels or Nanaimo bars are an Exception) 
There are regional mainstream unique dishes like poutine from Quebec, Items that can't be categorized as unique to a region like fresh seafood items from BC ,  lobster from the Atlantic provinces . Then there are the somewhat acquired taste items like prairie oysters, flipper pies in the Atlantic to sustenance food in the North (some of those are too much even for an adventurous eater). Canada a small country in terms of population offers a vast geography that makes for an interesting contrast in food philosophy as it is an abstract of ingredient focus and technique based in terms of cuisine. 
With such a wide canvas to come up with a menu here, O&B have left a lot to be desired in my opinion. Sure there is bannock bread and some signature dishes of poutine and a butter tart for 8$ (gasp) 
Give me some authentic regional dishes rather than a mainstream attempt at them, most of the menu items consist of common dishes with a twist of somewhat Canadian item. 
Anyway on to the main I ordered a Roast Duck and Poutine pizza after going through the whole menu as it was a combo of two items I enjoy. 
Beer selection was limited as they had Kieth, Mill Street, Labatt 50 and an another beer  (if you are going for a cliché might as well offer Molson Canadian!) I ended up with Labatt 50. Again give me some of the amazing beers Canada has to offer like La Fin Du Monde, Maudite (or most Unibrue gems for that matter), Dieu Du Ciel Line of beers, Dominus Vobiscum line of beers etc etc 
Anyway the Pizza arrived quickly. Initial impression was nothing special just a hodge podge of gooey stuff thrown on a pizza. Unfortunately the taste wasn't much of a departure from anything one might get from the California Pizza Chicken (CPK) chain of restaurants in US or dare I say CPK frozen offerings. 
The duck was being overwhelmed by the gravy and fries. The cheese curds were replaced by melted cheese and the fries were soggy. The meat had a salty finish that lingered well after dinner. I did enjoy the caramelized onions though. 
Service was prompt and quick so Kudos for that. 
I don't think I am being overly harsh in giving this place 2 stars. To be fair though I will revisit with perhaps a larger group as to try some other dishes and form a better opinion. update have revisited and tried a few other dishes rating still stands as 2 star.",2012-02-10 03:19:30

Spice Safar on King Street West is a stylish boutique cafe that does many things well.  The owner, ""Wil"" (short for Wilhelm)  gave us some detailed background on what led him to open this part patisserie, part lounge, part coffee house. Simply put, Spice Safar is his ""passion"" acted out in 3D.

The cafe seating area is furnished with comfy benches all in a row with low tables, much like mini VIP areas.  The warm caramel coloured wood on the walls make it cozy enough to diminish the night club feel.  But then there is the wallpaper, and crystal chandelier.

The three of us started off with the beverages recommended to us by Wil.  We tried the Cafe Americano, Americano Latte, and the Rooibos Red Latte ($3.95).  The latter won by a heart beat, plus it's full of good antioxidants.  As a tea lover, I have never tasted a better Rooibos Latte.  For the one coffee lover in our group, her palate was quite pleased with the coffee selections.

What we ate:

The Jerk Chicken Panino ($9.95), which was spicy and flavorful.  Filled with jerk-chicken, cilantro, truffled sweet potato puree, and served in a home-made foccacia.

The Pancakes ($11.95).  Fabulous ricotta pancakes drizzled with the 5 spice Safar house-made syrup and sprinkled with spiced caramelized nuts, and served with delicious grilled fruit on a skewer.  These are gourmet pancakes at its finest.  Served as well with 3 ""sides"" of yogurt, chocolate, and pureed banana in tiny amounts - all home-made of course.

The Eggs Benedict ($11.95) with (non-smoked) Salmon.  Not a winner.  Taste wise it did not meet our expectations, and one of the yolks was over poached and not runny.  We traded it in for the...

Waffles ($11.95).  Lemon and poppyseed waffles with a soft center and more crisp outside.  More dense that most waffles I've had, but definitely more tasty.  Served with the same 5 spiced-syrup and sides as the pancake, this dish was also a winner.

Arugula salad ($3.95) with avocado and mango in a special Safar house dressing.  We thought the salad was too bitter, and not balanced enough.

Portions were of a good size, attractively presented, and the food was easy to share amongst friends.  A great touch was the mineral water to cleanse the palate after drinking the coffee and lattes.

We will definitely return to this location for the Pancakes, Rooibos Red Latte, and a new Safar, which means ""journey"" in Arabic.",2010-09-07 14:38:51

They had a chicken wrapped in prosciutto that was just dry and not flavorful. Their mashed potatoes tasted like it came from a box. The short rib was ok, but not as good as you would think. The good parts were the salads and dips. Those were very good.

Came to try the pho which is one of my fave dishes.  While it wasn't perfect, they did a pretty good job!  My main issue was that the noodles came out all in a big solidified lump.  However, once i got them all separated the flavor was great, and they served it with all the traditional sides.  (Didn't ruin it by trying to fancy it up or anything).  At the end of the meal the waiter asked what we thought of their pho vs other places.  I mentioned the noodles and he said he would let the chef know, so 
hopefully it will be corrected!

They have a full bar, and a daily happy hour that runs almost all afternoon.  Some great deals on there, and the specialty drinks we tried were pretty good!

It's taken me 2 freaking years to get over there. Why didn't anybody yell at me sooner?
We had a group of 6, and on a Saturday night at about 7ish we were able to push 3 2-seaters together without inconveniencing anybody. I don't know if this is always the case, the place is relatively small.
This was the type of menu that makes you look at one option say, ""That looks good"" and then another and say ""Oh, that looks good too!"" and another and just say ""Well $h!t.""
So I asked the girl at the register, and she suggested the Gangnam Style burger, and I opted to stick with the fries as my side because Yelp told me to.

All burgers are served on a wooden board that has a hole cut out for the burger cup, a really simple but nice presentation. All 6 of our orders came out in about 7 minutes, which was perfect. 

Now, they have a warning on their menu, but the least they cook their burgers are medium. I'm a medium rare guy, always have been, but there's not really any arguing here. And frankly, you would never know the difference. These burgers are out of this world good. I especially loved the subtle spice in the Gangnam Style with the pork belly. I could eat this every day and never get tired of it. Their fries are also to die for; super crispy and well seasoned.

My only real complaint is the number of cashiers. When you go ""off hours"" they often have only 1 or 2 lanes open. I waited approx 30 minutes on two occasions to get through the cash - that's just unacceptable in my opinion. They have express checkout lanes but they are useless if you have a full cart.

My friend requested a custom drink for herself. Strawberry milk tea. Strawberry isnt a fruit that would come out so well and easily done when mixed with milk tea. Either you'd get it diabetes style with tons of sugar and powder and what not (yep a lot of people do this) or you'd mix with a syrup/jam or even fresh fruit. to be honest, i forgot what he did but as their way of style goes, they'll keep remaking it until you like it. 1st one was more ""sour"". true to a fresh strawberry taste ""breaking through"" the milk tea taste but as requested, less sweet. Pretty good. Has a nice strawberry flavor with its unique ""sourness"" but not masking the tea flavor either. He came around with a 2nd one for us to try. i guess he was experimenting with what he had.

Elsie called to tell us that the replacement part new was 800'ish. Ouch. GW then called around to the junk yards and found a part for us, and the bill for the part dropped to 250'ish.

I called twice regarding my reservations and my calls were always answered promptly by a nice gentleman who is exceptionally accommodating.

I love ACP already right when I walked into this cozy, rustic farm house setting... with no menu aside from what on the board. The same gentlemen being our waiter offers to take my jacket... yes please!

The vibe here is laid back and no people rushing around... the setting is intimate and quiet with mostly locals...Service is attentive and sincere... definitely not a ""tourist"" scene. I like that!

ACP's menu has limited choices but what we ordered seems to all nicely plated, prepare with care with the local ingredients.

Saumon fumé -  $11
- ""Smoking"" Salmon Sashimi nicely presented on a smoking vent

Ris de Veau (Veal Sweetbread) - $31
- Deep Fried Dumplings Stuffed Sweetbread

Cheese cake et confiture de prunes  - $8
- I never really like plums.. but this is delicious... tart of the cheesecake goes well with the light sourness of plums

The staffs are just so knowledgeable with every aspect of the menu and wine list... This is one of the time I enjoyed listening to my waiter goes on and on about the ingredients and the preparation of each dish... (the accent yes!!)

Kudos to Saryo for introducing me to hojicha - roasted matcha that has a deeper, more complex earthy flavour than regular matcha. I think I love it even more than matcha!  

The hojicha ice cream sundae was very good - I absolutely loved the ice cream! I liked the contrast of almost every ingredient in that sundae against the hojicha - the matcha cake bites, red bean, mochi and granola were all very good. Not too keen on the jelly, since I personally thought that it added a weird texture with the ice cream but that's just me. Price-wise, the sundae was a bit steep - I paid a little over $8 with tax and the sundae was in a medium sized cup (about the size of a grande cup from Starbucks). Maybe increase the size of the serving to justify the slightly higher price? 

Staff were very friendly - they even let me sample some hojicha because I was a bit hesitant about the ice cream at first (smart move from them because I ended up falling in love at first bite!). 

I also like the fact that Hojicha is connected to a ramen shop, Konjiki - very convenient for everyone to get desserts afterwards!

I was surprised to receive a phone call two days before our dinner to confirm our reservation. The caller asked me if I had an indoor/outdoor seating preference, and reminded me that Queen's Feast was going on. Calling to confirm was a nice touch, just like reservations used to be way back in the good ol' days.

We were seated as soon as we arrived. Doug was our server, and he did a fantastic job. We brought a special wine from our cellar, which Doug uncorked and served to us. ($15 corkage fee.)  The service was absolutely perfect, from beginning to end.

More amazing than the splendid service, however, was the food. My husband ordered the mussels. I can't eat or try mussels because I have developed an allergy, so I can't say firsthand how they tasted, or even how the broth tasted. What I CAN say is that I've never seen my husband so happy about his food. I asked him if I needed to leave him and the mussels alone for a moment. My husband said, and I quote, ""I have not had anything better since I had that escargot in Beaune, France."" Now, you need to realize he puts that dinner in Beaune up on a pedestal. That's his baseline for ultimate perfection. So to put the mussels in that category was the highest compliment he's paid any restaurant in Charlotte, ever.

I had the Vichyssoise myself, and I loved it. I may not have had the affair with my first course that my husband had with his, but it was damned good. The best I've had in the area as well.

Our main courses were solid, but not as surprisingly awesome as the first course. My husband had the short ribs, which he liked, but said were on par with other places in town. I had the chicken (I know, I'm so BORING!) which I ordered  primarily because I was interested in the black garlic buerre blanc. It was delicious and I really enjoyed it.

We both agreed on flourless chocolate cakes for our dessert. Again with the ooh-ing and the aah-ing. My husband and I both agreed it was the best, and probably most rich, flourless chocolate cake we'd ever had. Perfectly moist, almost like a mousse, and very delicious. I appreciated that the raspberry coulis was an accent on the plate and not on the cake, as I don't like raspberries very much.

Based on that one meal, we will certainly be back for lunches and dinners. Georges Brasserie was hands-down, the nicest meal I've ever had for Charlotte Restaurant week. You have another week to get there, so make your reservations. It's the best!",2013-07-22 22:22:00

I parked to get some Chipotle for lunch but figured I'd try this new spot. I remember seeing this place as it was beginning to open and I've been disappointed before by other places offering my beloved chicken gyro but what the hell... I can have Chipotle another day when I forget to bring a lunch. 

It's a bit confusing for some I gather because while I pay attention to the sign that's towards the back of the restaurant indicating where orders are placed, there are some who walk right down to the back and stand right next to me rather than behind me waiting to order. They should place some signage near the doors to indicate where to go to order... some people are clueless... or just don't follow directions. Aight... I have a space issue. I don't like people up in my space. There I said it! 

As regular as it is, I had to order the chicken gyro. I had to see if it would live up to my beloved chicken gyro from Greek Fiesta in the Raleigh/Durham area and well... it did. yay! I decided on the pasta salad as the lady told me it was a pretty popular side item and I discovered it also comes with some potato chips. the pasta salad was actually pretty good. I'm not down for cold pasta but this worked, especially with a bit of saltiness from the feta. At times there was a bit too much salt from the feta and the dressing. They may want to figure out how to tone that down a bit. 

So I took one star off because I get that they're trying to keep it healthy. 'ppreciate it! However, for us fatty folks or people that can splurge on their calories for a moment may appreciate some seasoned fries. Okay okay I'm just trying to turn my meal into what Greek Fiesta offers. I'm tellin you a chicken gyro with some seasoned fries be on point my people. My recommendation is that they throw that in the mix as an optional side item. You really can't go wrong. I bet that would be a great marketing ""tool"" for the younger folks who need a little fat in their lives. (not trying to make it a place for kids to kick it). But I mean you have Baklava and chocolate cakes staring me in the face when I order. Throw some fatty fries up in the mix and let's just go crazy with calories. Okay I'm done. 

I'll go back. I don't eat fast food but it may be worth it to drive to Bojangles to get my seasoned fries to go with my gyro.... okay enough about the fries.

Let us review: Sky bar, a delicious treat from the Necco factory (the place that makes the chalky valentine hearts that say stuff like ""fax me"" and ""text me ur heart""). It is a masterpiece (even Dan Kennedy of Candy Freak fame has stated so) of candy delight for the indecisive. Caramel, vanilla, chocolate, and peanut butter filling each get one single solitary chocolate pyramid all joined together in a melty seatbelt of ooey gooey self contained bliss. You can nibble one at a time, or shove the whole thing in your mouth for a psychedelic mouthgasm. At a grand $2.50 (I am used to like 75cents, but being across the country in a desert of 112degrees can up that price), it is a bargain. http://www.necco.com/ourbrands/default.asp?brandid=11

Violet Candies: the most appealing candy wrapper, I imagine myself in some kind of Victorian dress w/a parasol all Anne of Green Gables and shit, offering the candy to my beau while he paddles our boat in a dapper vest. It tastes like springtime, like potpourri, like mysterious goth girls in the East Village in the late 70s, like Alice in Wonderland, it is glorious and perfumey. And in an appealing square shape with a texture resembling tic tacs, candy hearts, candy necklaces and certs. It is like a grand of $1.50 I believe. http://victoryseeds.com/candystore/chowards_violet.html

Naughty Sodas. I am not much of a soda drinker-I quit all the caramel coloured sodas in 3rd grade cold turkey and never looked back. BUT I do have an extremely soft spot for root beer, orange, grape and other novelty flavours. Especially Stewart's brand. Back on the east coast, we had lil drive throughs that serve Black Cows, which is a root beer float. But Stewart's root beer is a masterpiece. Virgils is creamy and spicey, Hansens has a real licorice taste, Dr. Browns is anise tasty, but only Stewart's gets my vote every time. They had that one, cream soda, orange n cream, lime rickey, Jones Soda, Virgil's, and way too many other brands/flavors to count. Truly a refreshing way to cool down while perusing the strip. http://www.drinkstewarts.com/

Everything else. Well. There are some cool cupcake wrappers. And we were endlessly amused by the huge bouncy balls, but not $15 amused. The prices werent terrible, a lot of the same merch is at Urban for twice/three times as much. The wall w/photo booth is cute. I just don't get what they are going for. I was excited for this place, but I don't think it will be its own destination for myself personally.

And I agree w/everyone- more candy! Or cupcakes. Or food. Dang, there ain't no food in that corner and a lady gets hungry doin' all that browsing. And Dairy Queen doesn't quite get it. Maybe if they put in a pretzel machine or a soft serve or just had some other unique hand dipped candys?

OAhdbHQwIox71MHcMLVQcw,jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,OBSxiVTm8TuKN-IbtY8fmg,4,1,1,0,"I was at the dog park with my dogs when I started talking to a girl who was a bartender here. She told me I should check it out because it is so close to my house, so I did, AND, I love it.

The place is just gorgeous. I'm big on aesthetics so I don't hang around in too many dive bars unless they have a favorite beer or really good food. This place is dark and warm and inviting. My favorite kinda place. The televisions weren't too loud, it was just a really nice atmosphere.

As soon as I walked in the bartender gives a big, welcoming smile that made me feel like she really liked me being there. There are some other bartenders in town (Ahem, Lobby Bar) that should really take a lesson. 

She was fast and when she was off with someone else another bartender would come over and ask me if I needed anything. Just really cool people here. They offered me glass options, even, because of the type of beer I was drinking. Very cool.

I started to look at the menu and realized the food here just sounded so good. All of it. It made choosing something to eat really, really difficult. The menu is varied and with a little  something for everyone. I thought the menu was well thought out and diverse. Love that.

I ended up just needing something small so I ordered an appetizer of buffalo chicken bites. I was surprised when they came out wrapped in wontons. They were tasty, but if I'm already eating fattening buffalo bites, I don't want them wrapped in carbs and deep fried in lard. I'd rather have them in chunks where I can just dunk 'em in ranch without anything else getting in between me and my spicy bites. That doesn't mean they're bad, it just means I prefer them done a little differently. Kudos for originality, though. They could have used a couple of carrot sticks and some celery, but, whatever.

I had some time to kill and I couldn't just fill up on beer. Well, I could, but why when they have PB&J? Admittedly, it's also deep fried, but there's something very different about a sandwich being deep fried. Also, it was thankfully not wrapped in wonton. It was good, but the fried batter around it totally drowned out the taste of the PB&J. I didn't even get the slightest hint that I was eating PB&J. That's obviously a disappointment when you order something you think IS PB&J. So, really, you're just eating fried batter. There is something delicious about dipping said fried batter into chocolate, actually. I'm  just saying, don't go in and think you're going to taste the PB&J, but do be prepared for the deliciousness of batter and chocolate. 

The end of my food/beer affair here came to a disappointing end. There was a party upstairs and the bartender got a little busy so I didn't get the same attention as when I walked in. She did apologize, but I thought that an experienced bartender with help would be able to deal. Not a terrible end, just disappointing. I liked her spectacular service and just wanted more of it! 

If you live in Henderson/Green Valley this place is conveniently located with ample parking.

This was probably one of the worst, saddest pieces of fish I've ever eaten (minus when I try to make fish myself in my house which I hate because who wants to smell fish for the next three days after they cook it?). Anyway, I asked for it blackened and it came out lightly charred (??). I also opted for the mashed potatoes and gravy - OK.

35 Shrimp Alfredo - My husband's choice. There were 34 shrimp. That is all.

Steak & Boom Boom Shrimp - My brother's choice. He said it was good. I refrained from making fun of his Boom Boom Shrimp for about 40% of the meal.

Jambalaya (minus the rice) - My dad's choice. My dad is a on a no-carb diet and he ordered Jambalaya minus the rice. I had a bite, it was spicy, but missing something, not sure. Moving on.

Lobster Tail - Served with melted butter and veggies. My mom's choice. I did not get a chance to try it, she ate all of it. Selfish.

Drinks - Probably the best part. I got a Shock Top (lemon type flavor), hubby got two HUGE Blue Moons, and my father and I had shots of Jameson, that come with pickle juice as a back? Sure. Irish people gonna drink.

Desserts - Ridiculously indulgent, over the top monstrosities - whatevs, didn't stop me from eating them. We got two to split between the whole party - one was a Nutter Butter, peanut butter, chocolate thing, the other was a brownie sundae. 

Overall - a place to go with my fam-bam because it's safe bet.",2015-03-27 17:05:17

She beat me there, and they had hot water awaiting my arrival. Bonus points already! There were three technicians working, all very friendly and made conversation with us, but did not interrupt our girl talk either. 
We were happy with our pedis. Great massage, & hot rocks. Not too quick, and I will be upgrading to the deluxe next time for only $10 more. 
The salon is an average size, but clearly still new. There is not a HUGE variety of colors, gels and styles. However, on my second visit for a gel mani, I realized they can do just about anything you ask. 
I showed the girl, Tina, my Halloween costume and she asked if she could make up a design. I love what she came up with. I also noticed the girl next to me showing her nail guy a picture. So basically if they don't have the color or design you want, they will come up with a way to make you happy. 
I am glad I found this place early on, because they are going to be busy this holiday season. I can't wait to book with Tina again and see what she comes up with next.",2014-11-04 18:46:14

The food was fantastic and bursting with flavor. Since it was my first time there, I wanted an introspective take on the menu, and that's when Nick (one of the 4 owners) came over and walked me through the menu as well as his favorite items. 

We started with the chicken fried chicken wings. They were exceptional. The black sesame syrup they drizzled on top was delicious and unlike anything I've tasted. Next, we ordered the smoked ""pig face"" dumplings. These were by far my favorite of the night. Served with kimchi and pickled peppers and their own in house made sriracha. So delicious, I was sad there was only 4! Next, we had one of their steamed buns with the pulled pork. Very delicious, although, I wasn't a fan of the bun itself. Only because this entree comes with two sauces for dipping and the bun would get too spongey.  And finally, we ordered our main dish. I got the chicken katsu with a soft poached egg. SO GOOD. The sauce was a perfect blend of spicy and sweet.

Also, to drink, you have to try the Donny Wang Fiz. Super refreshing and perfect with your meal.

Our server Sydney was very attentive and super nice. The customer service there is outstanding. And the location is perfect, right next door to one of my favorite watering holes, the George and Dragon.

If money is not a concern, raise the rating by 2 stars.

So, this is a nice place.  It's really pretty inside.  They have good food.  But - and here it is - it's not cheap.  This isn't Bloor West.  This is the junction.  This is a place where I should be able to grab a beer for 5 or 6 bucks.  When I'm dropping dropping the same price on a pint here, that I could pay for a pitcher down at College and Bathurst, it could be said that something just might be wrong.

Again - though - this is a trendy place.  

Just don't hope to host an event here.  Friend of mine wanted to have her birthday here, and soak up the environment, but they wouldn't let her reserve an area for 15 people.  Now, maybe, this is understandable if the people looking to make reservations are flaky 19 year olds.  But when you have grown up adults, looking to have a thirtieth birthday, you'd think a venue would want to encourage that.

Sadly - not so much.  

So - end of the day, great beer on tap, and great food - also a great location, and a great vibe.  The only thing is, you're really paying for it.",2012-12-22 00:57:53

This place paled in comparison to the other two. It was a decent environment inside. The pedicure I got was only $25 which is a good price. As someone else mentioned, the water was very hot. The chairs are old and not very effective at massaging. My chair cut off after about five minutes and would not go back on. I am also used to a foot massage/leg massage as part of my typical pedicure experience. She did not do this, but she did punch my feet a few times each. That was a little out of what I am used to. She did scrape off my dead skin, but she did it very lightly and left more skin on than I prefer. I am missing some nail polish on the corners of my nails. They are also cut kind of crooked. My eyebrow waxing experience wasn't so great either. She did not shut the door and had kind of unpleasant bedside manner. My left eyebrow had a little hole from where she plucked too many hairs out.

Most of the time, we share the same views about what really matters, food, and Johnny McGuire's is our unanimous Town Square quick dining go-to.  

I'm super picky with American sandwiches, why, I'll freely admit to ya any day that I'm a Banh Mi bitch, proud of it.  But Johnny McGuire's gets me.  Made-to-order sandwiches that boast a generous amount of high-quality meats and yummy toppings.  They don't cook the meats till you order it, so expect a slightly longer wait time than most sandwich joints, if you want to eat better that is.

220-B and Naked Evader are among the Mr.'s favorites.  I absolutely depend on the El Buey, grilled steak with avocado, onions, peppers, and jalapenos.  It is a perfect combination of the four things I look for but seldom find in non-Vietnamese sandwiches: hot, sour, salty, and sweet.  The Mr. loves their whole pickles, and he always gets one.  I always get their homemade chips, also made-to-order, a detriment to your waistline, but worth every added inch.

It's definitely pricier than most places, which is par for the course in Old Montreal. A raspberry and cheese brioche was $4.75, chia seed pudding was $10.00 and coffee was approximately $3.00 each (before tax and tip).   From what I was told, the brioche had great flavouring and was very flakey.  The chia seed pudding had a great fruity flavour but also plenty of protein with the museli and chia seeds.  After 1.5 days of eating junk food, eating this was very refreshing (plus it was the cheapest thing on their brunch menu lol).  It's a great option for healthy eating.  

With regards to the coffee, it has a very strong coffee aroma, so if you like it, that's great.

Hot Pot - I've tried three times in total and had horrible experiences every time. Honestly, I just don't think hot pot is for me since everyone else enjoys their experience. You get the menu and write down your items and soon they'll bring you a pot with your choice of broth (either individual or shared amongst friends). It takes only a couple minutes to warm up the broth and soon your choice of ingredients will come out for you to add to your broth. They also have a bar with different sauces and little ingredients (lime, lemon, eggs, parsley, etc.) that you are free to use however you so choose. 

It is all you can eat and there are more options during dinner, which of course will cost more. This also applies to sushi. 

Sushi - it's more about quantity rather than quality. If you're searching for quality of taste, this is not the place for you. It will taste like what it is meant to be, but nothing noteworthy.

Seriously?!  I was living next to the flippin' place and I couldn't even go there.  Well, as soon as I saw the new building I shut up pretty fast.  

The new facilities are absolutely amazing.  The architecture truly compliments the pieces in the museum.  The painting restorations blew me away as well.  When I first walked into the European art section, I found myself face to face with four vibrantly restored wall sized painting.  When I say ""wall sized"" I am understating things.  It's a huge wall.  I can't even imagine how much time and effort it must have taken to make those pieces look like that.

The armor collection is always amazing.  I recall that being one of my favorite parts of the museum as a kid, and it still is.

The modern art section on the upper floors is breathtaking (if you're into that sort of thing).  I remember looking in one room then hearing music...what is that?  Of course, it had to be a Shostakovich Cello Concerto.  My fiancee and I ran to where the sound was coming from, and sure enough it was!  We high fived.  The security guard shook his head and laughed at us.  Worth it.  That was one of my favorite pieces I have seen.  If you haven't listened to any Shostakovich, this portion of the concerto is about as bleak as music can get.  It was accompanied by a film of trees in winter...no leaves...random blinking lights.  I can only imagine what that poor security guard must feel like after an hour of that...

Anyway, I'm a dork, and I thought that it was awesome.

There was a line up for takeout bento. Maybe 4-5 in front of me but one guy in the front ordered 10 bento boxes to go and he pretty much wiped out all the side dishes, at least the one I wanted. I guess it's night time so they weren't refilling and ur left with whatever's remaining. 
Didn't bother me too much since they have a wide selection of side dishes. 
We ordered two bento, one popcorn chicken (most people ordered this one), and one chicken cutlet. All Bento are same price $8 after tax.

We took our bento to the nearby metro square food court and ate there.

For the popcorn chicken, I felt that the seasoning and texture was good but it's not hot and crispy enough. Maybe there were many orders so they made a lot in advance.
As for the chicken cutlet it was hot and crispy and tasted good.
Each bento comes with choice of three side dishes and u can pick the same one as well. They were a bit on the greasy side but not salty which is good to complement the chicken.

Mama Napoli Pizza is a food truck (more accurately, trailer) that seems to post up only outside Tenaya Creek Brewery once a week, judging from the former's Facebook posts.

The crust was chewy and crispy enough, although it wasn't as impressive as the best brick-and-mortar offerings. It's a 14-inch pie, so the pricing isn't all that bad for a food truck.

The line was ridiculous, like down the block but it was Friday and the Grand opening ..... I was happy to wait because the streets were smelling of succulent bbq.  

After a 40 minute wait (which was to be expected on opening day) the cutest, bald head, ring in nose girl took my order with lightening speed she turned around and shouted out my order..... NYC pastrami sandwich, bbq brisket, Mac and cheese, greens, coleslaw, crack wings and bbq baked bean..... 

As I walked to the back of the restaurant and  sat outside under the stars. The back yard area is just enough space for you to enjoy your meal while stretching your legs. Omg....is that my stomach!

 Just as I looked up, the waitress had my food....

I think I'm in pig heaven... the aroma was killing my nasal passages. There were so many delightful smells I was on over drive.  

Before eating we must...
FIRST..... give thanks to the amazing brisket, bbq ribs, NYC pastrami sandwich, crack wings  greens, mac and cheese...... 

I started with the crack wings.... I ordered it dry and with sauce. It was delicious, the flavors were all there... as I looked down I saw four crack bones looking back at me. In my Urkel voice ""Did I do that""!

Mac and cheese : the cheese was so velvety smooth and really delicious.  Just like mac and cheese should taste. Not watery, soupy cheese but that thick cheese. Yummy! 

Greens: the greens were good with a little kick,not spicy but a kick. Just what you need! 

NYC pastrami: this was by far the best. It took me back to Katz's Deli in NYC.  The pastrami melted in your mouth and the marble bread complimented the pastrami so well. I give a NYC/BX salute to this sandwich. It made me proud! 

BBQ beans: just like slow roasted on a stove bbq beans should be. It had an awesome smoked flavor.

By 11:30, we were out the door!  3 hours later, our mattress set had arrived as promised.  George, the delivery driver, was as nice as could be!  I had to tip him $10 and give him a couple bottles of water.  This place only charged me $40 for delivery paid to the driver.  I also bought a mattress cover, some 2100 thread count bamboo sheets, and got it all for less than $800!  It's the best price and service I have ever had at ANY store!

I could have just written about this cake in a short tip, but nope, I chose to dedicate a whole review to this thing. I'm cool like dat. 

Yes, we all know that Buca, Bar Buca and Buca Osteria Enoteca (opening soon in Yorkville) are solid, but do you specifically know about this stunning cake on their dessert menu? Probably not. I think that people tend to go for the other insanely good and more popular options and skip over this traditional Florentine cake option.

My admittedly shoddy photo was initially of my cute work friends, but for the purpose of this review, I have lovingly cropped them out of the shot and we are left with the blurry, zoomed-in, dome-shaped zuccotto. As a point of interest, the zuccotto is said to be shaped this way to resemble the dome of Florence's Duomo.

When I was in Florence for the first time, I climbed the stairs to get to the top of the Duomo and was stunned by the view of the city. You will reach a similar kind of bliss when you share this dessert. 

The price of the zuccotto ($26) is also like the climb to the top of the Duomo: a bit steep.The menu does state that this serves two though, and with elements of Gianduja, chocolate, Frangelica and cream, it could easily serve 3 or 4 people (or just one person, depending on your mood). You can also tell that a lot of care has gone into constructing the cake. 

It's a dreamy dessert combining a cakey top half soaked in Frangelica, a chocolate mousse filling, a gianduja cookie base (we only realized this after we had finished the rest of the cake - best surprise!) and a cream sauce poured over the top... Ciao bella zuccotto!",2014-06-03 21:09:24

 ( gfs brand is my safe bet ). Very disappointing that offering such a small variety of items that places couldn't put a little more effort or fresh made into it. First visit and not sure if we would come try any menu items as the overall place needs some polite staff and a good cleaning as the entry way was full of trash and leaves then your having to use bowls at a buffet due to no plates and the place was not even half full so being busy wont cut it as to why bowls are out for a buffet.  Please step back and see what your offering to your patrons and maybe improve on it and you could have something much better.

Lets see the salad bar the macaroni salad had been sitting out there so long most of the noodles were rock hard, the pudding had a dark film on top from drying out now lets talk about the little choices on the salad side let alone old wilted items , then their is the soup if you found a clean bowl with no dried on food then you got a choice of four soups two cream soups browned from sitting all day or soggy mushy chicken noodle. Now the fish fry sad is a good way to express it or soggy nasty poor excuse of food.

To add to ordering efficiency, the menu is as uncomplicated as it gets, with only a few options. I always end up ordering the same thing, and literally within a minute of ordering, the food starts arriving. 

The portions don't seem like it would satisfy when it first arrives, but underneath those four giant shrimp wontons is a generous serving of perfectly cooked noodles. The broth is clean, and everything is just the way a bowl of wonton noodles should be. You've never had shrimp wontons until you've had them here.

The lunch specials are affordable, and in portions that are just right for someone who doesn't want a food coma before 3PM.

They've got beer and wine, Thai iced tea, and your favorite sodas...which come in cans, not in fountain form!

Their stock is huge and the prices are great.  Also they restock all the time, so there are rarely empty pegs for art supplies that are essentials for you.  They also carry other things like toys, costumes (for halloweeen), note books and other odds and ends other than artist tools.

The staff are fairly helpful and know a lot about the products they are selling.  They often ask if you need help and it's very easy to find staff in the store.  The same can't be said for places like Curry's or Michael's.  The check out is also very quick and painless and there never seems to be a huge line up when paying.

They have clearance items on occasion including stretched canvas and marker packs, which end up being a great deal.

The place sits in an old Bob Evans restaurant that had been closed for a few years.  And this is the type of restaurant that fits well in this area.  

Cafe South a gem of a homestyle restaurant.  It's clean, the staff is super friendly and the service is quick.  Oh yeah, the food is awesome too.

I was craving a salad but for these types of places I usually test them out with the meatloaf.  If the meatloaf is good, then everything else has to be good as well, right?  

So the meatloaf came with the option of gravy or tomato sauce.  I went with the latter because everyone does gravy around here.  Homestyle places have a tendency to over salt things like meatloaf and mashed potatoes but not here.  Everything was seasoned just right.  The meatloaf had wonderful flavors and that tomato sauce was really tasty too.  The mashed potatoes were good but they needed a bit of butter to make them better. 

The meal came with your choice of biscuit or cornbread.  I went with the cornbread and it was soft, flavorful and slightly sweet -- probably the best for the home-style place I've been to in Charlotte.

I also ordered a salad with raspberry vinagrette dressing but it came out at the same time as the meatloaf and I spent more time with the meat that I didn't have room for the salad. 

Like most home-style places, you get a good portion of food here.

It is definitely a convenient place to go for a quick lunch or dinner. I like the homey feel of the cafe/restaurant, with plenty of booths and tables. 

Some of my go-to menu items include the Napa almond chicken salad sandwich (a refreshing crunchy chicken salad on soft white bread that has almond slivers and grape pieces in it - trust me, it works!), the Fuji apple chicken salad (with crispy apple chips, blue cheese, and a sweet vinaigrette - delicious!), and the barbecue chicken salad (vaguely reminiscent of the Cheesecake Factory barbecue chicken salad).

The staff are pretty friendly, especially the smiley Filipino evening manager, Jun. My hubby and I have lucked out sometimes when they have given out free pastries while we were dining in. 

One important tip: if you plan to eat at Panera more than once in your lifetime, make sure you sign up for their Panera card, a free membership that comes with tremendous benefits including a free pastry of your choice for signing up, an annual free pastry for your birthday (that unlike many other places does not need to be redeemed only on your birthday), and various other offers the more times you visit and make purchases at Panera locations. It seems over the last six months, I have received 3 emails from Panera informing me that I was entitled to a free daily coffee (any size) for the months of August, November, and January. For these reasons as well as the consistent service, clean comfortable dining atmosphere, and healthy food choices, I am happy to continue to keep going back to this location.

Once inside, we were seated in the lounge, which would probably be awesome in the summer, but was very cold despite a fireplace being on. We had 3 different people wait on us even though our section wasn't busy at all. 

I wanted to order a cup of French onion soup and a sandwich. They offered a you pick 2 thing, but the sandwich I wanted wasn't featured. So I asked the waiter if I could order just a copy of soup instead of the bowl that was $7. He said no that it was only sold by the bowl. So I ended up ordering the you pick 2 as I didn't want to order a $7 soup and $13 sandwich. I assumed I was getting a bowl of soup (since they don't sell cups) and a 1/2 of a sandwich. When my entree came out it was a cup of soup and maybe a 1/4 of a sandwich. It was very tiny. Everything tasted good, I was just really disappointed in the size/price/service.",2016-12-09 21:53:27

My son had two beef tacos which he said were the best tacos he's had. The shells are freshly made, not sure if they're grilled or fried but they were amazing. My husband and I had the carnitas burrito. The meat was very good and it was topped with more yummy guacamole. We had a little sticker shock when we paid, it was $60 for all 4 meals, chips and guac and 4 drinks. This seems a little pricy for the atmosphere since it isn't a sit down restaurant. However my daughter says they support her media club at school and of course the food was delicious so we will be back.

It's a little pricier than Trader Joe's, and there isn't as huge of a selection as TJ's, but I forgive these grievances because Sunflower is less than 2 minutes from my apartment. 

The olive bar is the bomb-diggity. They have all the basics plus some delicious unique choices, like sliced sun-dried tomatoes (When you don't want to shell out several more dollars for a whole bag or jar of them) and marinated mozzarella.

Speaking of cheese, their section is TDF: Anything you could want! It's located next to their awesome--albeit small--selection of premade meals. They make a FAB single-serving vegetable lasagna topped with breadcrumbs. Try it out before I buy it all. They have some tasty looking breakfast burritos, but I refuse to cheat on my love, Fiesta Burrito.

The pricing on the cereal section is a little outrageous, but there are always deals on their store-brand ""Kashi"" knock offs. If you see Peace Cereal give it a shot, even if it's a few bucks more than your regular. SO GOOD.

Their ""ethnic"" (Mexican and Asian, let's be honest) aisle is pretty piddly, but you'll find most basics you need. Like I said, there are a few negatives bringing it down a star but for a place so close to me I can't help but keep coming back. It's great!",2011-11-13 19:55:07

I shared the fried chicken club with a friend (so nice of them to have split the sandwich in half and plated the halves on separate plates). I think the sandwich would do without the mayo and bacon-- my lips were burning from salt after eating it. Having said, the chicken is crispy and juicy inside, and the bun is buttery and soft.

Parking: After 5:30pm it's validated and you only pay $2. Very convenient.

It's easier to compare to this restaurant to other Brazilian steakhouses in large cities. Against that competition, Samba stacks up very well.

Also, compared to these other places, Samba is a bargain. $35 for dinner and $20 for brunch is a steal for high-end all you can eat with meat. For those that are on a tighter budget, salad bar only is completely acceptable and sacrifices little - you can certainly compose a great meal there. 

The service from the Gauchos is entertaining - I agree with those who have said that the waitstaff can be slow in refreshing water and getting drinks. The bar is great and the drinks are reasonably priced.

The positives:  Very friendly staff, the purpose of the restaurant is wonderful, the collard greens are amazing, decent wine selection, and the willingness of the management to talk to you about things not working with your meal.  

The not-so positives:  

Spare ribs should be tender where they should be easy to pick off the bone.  These were very tough and I was fighting with them with the butter knife.  At least serve them with a better knife.  

Water glasses were only refilled for some of the people at our table...seemed to be the pretty ones; the banana pudding - while the claim is it is the signature dessert - it was a bit runny and didn't seem to be set long enough.

I was disappointed with the ribs.  The waiter asked my truthful opinion and I told him.  He said it was taken care of and the manager came over and talked to me about it as well.  I appreciate this and the purpose of this restaurant and in order to make things right, the staff needs to know about these flaws.",2011-07-13 02:31:35

Having an allergy to avocado, the server immediately took care of it and I enjoyed the chimichanga. I would be close to making this a 3 star review, because we weren't blown away by the food, but the service and everything definitely made up for it.

Service was okay here this time. Didn't feel like our server went so much out of his way for us but it wasn't bad either. 

Finally got the full portion of the maitake mushrooms and it was just as good as the sample my friend made for me the first time I went. I almost finished the whole bowl to myself.

I was a little confused thinking they charged us for 4 but when the itemized check came out we were only charged for 2. Then I realized that the clams were a lot smaller than the last two times I went. We got the ribeye special cooked to medium. Sooo good and perfectly cooked! The lentils on this dish were amazing and everything went together so well. The lobster dumplings were eh. Not my personal fave, but honestly I think the bone marrow dumplings were better.

However, H Mart loses big time in their food court. Their selections are vastly limited compared to Galleria, and their food quality overall is quite sub-par. They do serve Pho there if you insist in having that, as Galleria doesn't offer Pho.

okYUb9LuQ5Je-vDrIgOzLA,kHGRDaZt4nHgNSJcjOTDeQ,e1RcTvtihmYdf8At7hLgRw,3,22,3,5,"Two-and-a-half years ago, I reviewed the MGM Grand Detroit in honor of Issue 3 allowing casinos in Ohio.  Now with Cleveland's casino finally open, it's time to see how our city stacks up.  Overall, I think Horseshoe Cleveland does the best it can with limited space and other restrictions and is a welcome improvement over many of the casinos in the region.

FOOD - In brief, the 2nd floor food court is overpriced:  $13 for a Corky & Lenny's corned beef sandwich, $9.50 for a Rosie & Rocco's sub with 3 rather plain, regular-sized meatballs, and $5.50 for a NY-style slice of pizza from the same.  Add to that the sparse available seating, and I wouldn't recommend the food court for workday lunchers looking for a place to sit down.  Don't expect Las Vegas quality and selection from The Spread buffet in the basement, but it's miles above Presque Isle's pathetic attempt, arguably better than Seneca Allegheny's Thunder Mountain Buffet, but not as impressive as Palette Dining Studio at MGM Grand Detroit.  The Sunday brunch ($22, including my iced tea) had the usual brunch buffet fare and was disappointing except for the bacon carving station and the Asian station with some decent fried rice, char su pork, and General Tso's chicken.  Dinner ($24) had the heaviest food, but again, nothing remarkable.  Like most buffets, you leave thinking about how much you ate rather than any particular item you had.  The exception may be lunch ($14), which offers a decent value.  Judging by the line to get in, many senior citizens of Cleveland agree, so expect to wait a bit unless you have a Diamond or Seven Stars Total Rewards card.  The lunch offerings were similar to, but a bit lighter, than dinner, with one of the stations offering sandwiches and wraps instead of entrées.

CASINO - Structurally, I love the first floor with the big columns and large chandeliers, all adding a touch of classic elegance rarely exhibited in casinos.  There are 6 craps tables with limits I've seen as low as $10 and as high as $50, usually settling on $25 at peak times and $15 off-peak.  All the craps tables offer the major benefit of 100x odds, though you won't usually see anyone putting more than double odds behind the line.  The tables are almost always full--the dealers need to start making room for those looking to play by moving the folks who are only spectating.  The first floor also has some carnival games--3 and 4 Card Poker, Mississippi Stud, and Ultimate Texas Hold 'Em--along with blackjack (Hit Soft 17), which were all at $15 limits during non-peak times.  The rest of the first floor is filled with plenty of 1¢ and 2¢ video slots.  I spotted 10 very popular Quick Hit penny slots and some traditional $1 slots with terribly low progressives of $2,500 and $1,000.

The less impressive second floor looks fairly ordinary by comparison and is packed with machines.  Again, lots of 1¢ and 2¢ slots, but also some Blazing 7's and similar variants with $2,500 progressives at 25¢ and $10,000 at $1.  8 25¢ Wheel of Fortune slots were very popular and continually occupied.  Video poker is on the second floor, though all pay schedules were under a 98% return.  There are tons of single-line VP machines:  25¢ 6-5 Bonus Poker (96.87% return), 20-12-10-4 Deuces Wild (97.58%), 8-5 Jacks or Better (97.30%), a row of 8-5 JoB Sequential Royal progressives (97.53%), 8-5 Double Double Bonus (96.79%), and $1 9-5 Triple Double Bonus (97.02%).  Multi-play VP is tucked into a corner:  5, 10, and 25¢ 6-5 JoB and Bonus Poker Super Times Pay (95.26% and 97.14%), 3 50-play 6-5 STP machines, as well as 2 popular 100 play STP and 3 Double STP machines that I couldn't get a look at.  Finally, the table games on the second floor mostly had limits at $25 with the addition of 2 mini-baccarat and 2 pai gow poker tables.  Blackjack is still ""Hit Soft 17"" except for the $100 tables in the high limit room that did not permit mid-shoe entry (though one dealer said the table could vote).  The high limit room also had slots ranging from $5 to $500, VP at $5 and $10, and 3 STP $1 machines.  I liked the fact that the high limit room had at least a little bit of daylight peeking through the closed curtains along the perimeter walls.

The top floor has a 30 table WSOP-branded poker room with games and waiting lists conveniently accessible via the Bravo Poker Live app.  The Diamond Lounge has some of the nicest furnishings I've seen among VIP rooms--better than the MGM Grand Detroit's Platinum lounge and even the Diamond lounge at Caesar's Palace.  Unfortunately, the lounge does not have its own bathrooms and, due to Ohio law, the bar inside still can't comp alcoholic drinks.

I've tried to cram a lot into 5,000 characters, but the bottom line is that I found Horseshoe Cleveland (pleasantly smoke-free, by the way) better than Presque Isle, Seneca Alleghany, and even MGM Grand Detroit.  I would still rank it below Harrah's New Orleans and the Atlantic City and Las Vegas casinos I've visited.",2012-06-13 03:22:07

With that in mind, the Beautiful Carin and I, while we were out running a few errands today, were trying to decide what to do for lunch. 
Instead of the sandwich or late Sunday breakfast option, we were close to Humble Pie and decided to stop in. 
We hadn't been there in 3-4 months (one of the things I love about Yelp is that it pushes me to both try new places and revisit spots that I haven't been to in awhile).
It was not busy, which was both a blessing and disquieting. There should be more people there on a beautiful Sunday afternoon! 
The food is really very good, and the service was excellent (both better than the last time we were there, I think). 
I don't know if I attribute that to a less crowded place, or just improvements in everything, overall. I don't know and I shouldn't over-analyze.
We sat on the patio, and it is very comfortable and pleasant out there. This is a quiet corner of the Hilton Village strip mall, so it's easy to enjoy a conversation with out traffic and noise.
We had a sausage and roasted fennel pizza and veggie salad. Both were terrific! I prefer a more savory than sweet pizza, generally, and this one walked the line nicely. The tomato sauce and the roasted fennel have just enough sweetness to provide a counterpoint to the salty sausage and olives. Crust has a great texture and flavor, in and of itself, and was nicely baked, with just a little blackness at the edges. Nice Job!

The dinner salads were pretty forgettable, too.  They arrived smothered in vinaigrette dressing.

Here's how it works: be prepared to wait in line if you come during peak eating times. It's $7.99 for your choice of two items (sandwhich, soup or salad). Its kind of like a subway line where you can see everything made in front of you. You order your sandwhich or salad with the first person in the line. And you just move down the line. And you order your soup from the people standing in front of the soups. There are add ins to the soup like bacon, cheese or croutons for an additional charge. By the time you get to the cashier, your entire order is ready. They also have syrups to add flavor to your drinks. 

My absolute favorites are the BBQ pulled pork sandwhich with clam chowder. The sandwhiches are huge and packed with flavor. And the clam chowder is thick and chunky. The blueberry maple salad was a refreshing alternative to clam chowder on a hot day. The dressing they used was light and added to the fresh blueberries and maple chunks in the salad. 

I look forward to trying everything on the menu!!!",2013-06-10 01:11:30

My how the memories of my late 20's have seemed to fade.  Back in the 90's, I bought Branch Whitney's, ""Hiking Las Vegas.""  It was a book about 60 hikes within 60 minutes of the Strip.  Back in the those days, the information in this book was pure gold.  I sumitted THP a minimum of 2 times and a maximum of 3 times.  Again, time escapes me so I cannot say for sure.

The evening before May 9th, the GF, who has had THP on her bucket list for many years and I came up with a plan to conquer the peak.

Armed with a newly purchased National Parks Pass, we arrived in the somewhat early morning hours.  I was a bit taken back by the about of traffic on a Monday.  Through the gate we went to the Sandstone Quarry parking lot.  Again, I was taken back by the other vehicles already parked there.

We prepped and I threw on my shoulders, the already field tested Tenzig.  Bucket list check off for the GF....a training op for me (THHE).  A quicker check of Whitney's publication, confirming what I thought I already knew about there being no trail but only a route to the summit, we followed the written words and proceeded as it instructed.

Something seemed off.  Something seemed amiss.  Was it Father Time playing hell with my senses.  Nothing seemed familiar to those days....now....so long ago.
We would eventually make our way to the chute after trail blazing to it's base.  The sounds of other hikers confirmed our suspicions we were in the right place.

Up the chute we went.  Beware....there are many trails.  The only one that really matters is the one you are on that goes up.  There was for a time a sequence of green dots painted on rocks.  We assumed this was route.  In retrospect, I am not sure when those dots were placed.  All that mattered was the accent.

Eventually, we would make it to the ridge line leading to the backside of the turtle.  The backside was a little more radical than I remembered.  I had told the GF once we made it to that point, it would be a gradual climb.  Damn you Daddy Time!  It was more of an angle than I remembered.  

Some two hours and forty-five minutes later we would find ourselves at the summit.  The GPS had us at over 2000 feet of elevation gain in 2.5 (approximate) miles.  The view from the top is one to behold.... You are actually above the many man-made whirly birds flying in the immediate area.  Hearing swifts zoom by like Sidewinder missiles and performing organic aerobatics was better.

We hung out for little while under the shadow of a Juniper Pine taking in the sights and sipping JetBoil tea.  I also got to manipulate the Vortex spotting scope I was lugging around with me.

We headed down after a while.  Following the natural flow of things led us to a refined trail unlike the one we had followed up.  There was no green dots.  Just the a well defined path that took us down the chute above other hikers following the same route we had up.  This particular path is the furthest right you can go heading down.  If you're going up....it on the left.  

Once down from the chute, we followed an even more refined trail that actually had markers.  This was not the book and must have been placed after its publication.

One interesting observation I made was that 99% of the people we found on the trail up and down were friendly and returned our greetings.  The closer we got to the parking lot, the more this type of courtesy became infrequent.  I have a theory I will address when I write my Red Rock Conservation Area review.

All in all, I absolutely recommend you check this off your list.  I will say that regardless of the time of year....no summer....bring water.  I passed several people going up and or coming down with no water!  BRING WATER!  Again, I have a theory about this to be addressed later.

It doesn't take too long to bring us these mere paper menus, if you gave it to us, we'd be out of your way for the next while, while you can tend to other customers. I get it though that there's only one waitress, but that's on your end and not our's. I saw one chef come out, so I know at least there's one guy in the kitchen cooking. When there's a menu item that's not available for the day 'cause it's sold out, then you should say so when giving the menu to us so that we know not to choose it. My friend who chose that dessert had to think about it and pick it again.

Food took a while to come out, we were all pretty hungry. However, it was worth the wait 'cause it was good and the time in between each course coming out was just right. Not in a rush but not too long in between. It was well paced and there was no rush for us to leave either, as we like to take our time. Eating out is an experience. One thing though, I didn't want the fries that came with my main course and asked if I could substitute it with something else. Waitress flat out denied it. Too blunt. I've been a waitress before so I don't believe you can't do something about it. I'm not telling you to alter the dish, but what I asked was to change one of the sides on my plate which took up one third of it, you could have at least asked the kitchen and pretended. So I'm not pleased with the lack of accommodation, it could have been better.

For appetizer, I had homemade French country style pate, toast and gherkins. My friends had roasted butternut squash soup. Both were decent. My main course was Mediterranean Quebec chevre, roasted eggplant caviar, roasted red peppers, open sandwich on toasted country bread served with garden salad. I liked it, would give that four stars. My friend had Nicoise: tuna, hard boiled eggs, French beans, red skin potatoes, roma tomatoes, black olives and roasted red peppers. The tuna was shredded and looked identical to the canned tuna in stores, however, it was fresh. Another friend had the seafood pasta: fettuccini with black tiger shrimp, bay scallops, roasted red peppers, baby spinach in a white wine rose sauce. I think that one was really good. For dessert, I had poached pears served with vanilla ice-cream and chocolate sauce. I think it was the best course of the meal and deserves five stars. It is very cold to eat ice-cream in the winter, but I don't regret the choice. Each part of the dessert was equally good, the pear had a bit of crunch to it but was still soft, the ice-cream was very creamy which was better than I had expected because vanilla ice-cream had sounded plain and the chocolate sauce was the best topping. My friends had vanilla and cardamom creme brulee, which was good also but I liked the pear dessert better.

Overall, I'd say it was a positive experience. I would come again if anyone ever asked me to, but I don't think anytime soon. I like the fact that this place offers vegetarian options. Lunch is $18CAD for Winterlicious not including taxes and gratuities, so it's a way to try French cuisine for a low cost.",2015-02-09 03:18:45

Put in an online order at 3:00pm for a 5:30 take out.  I ordered 2 of the Tonkatsu Ramens with Chashu pork and menma, a cucumber roll, spam roll, and a salmon avocado roll.  My fiance did 4 years in Osaka, and loves ramen but doesnt like fish, so we got a few non fish rolls.

Upon opening up the ramen, I thought it was a joke.  One tiny ass piece of Chashu in each, and two single small pieces of menma.  They had to be hiding more underneath right?  Wrong.  Total cheapskate thing to do.  See the picture.  If management at Fukumimi or Monta saw ramen served like that, it would never fly.  On top of that, for $9.00, the portion size was about 60% of any other ramen place in LV.

Sushi came out wrong and again they skimped.  Salmon avocado had no avocado.  Come on guys.  Spam roll was some random fish, so the fiance skipped it.  Cucumber roll was not rolled all the way, fell apart.

The one thing I can say is that their online ordering system is very good.  Better than most.

I do not give many bad reviews, and I review a lot.  Ninja Teriyaki + Sushi To Go could do better, but inattentiveness and just plain cutting corners on the customer is not doing them any favors.  These things could be fixed.  The food isnt bad, but you cant get away with multiple screw ups, poorly executed prep, and cheapskating on customers needs to get called out.  I hope they get it right, I want to see them succeed.",2018-08-19 14:32:09

I'll give it 3.5 stars for now and when I go next time I'm sure I'll bump it up.

Went here on a Saturday night with my friend around 7pm. As usual, no place to park in this busy shopping center parking lot. So we parked next door near the Filipino place. 

Nice looking place. I remember eating here when it was a Pho restaurant a long time ago, and the space is nice with several tables around the edge, and a long counter area ala a sushi place, which they have, but really you come here for the marinated meat BBQ sticks. Menus dropped off and drink orders taken quickly. Our waitress must have been new because she had to go ask when I inquired about the pricing on the specials. Nonetheless she did a nice job even though it was kind of weird getting the meat sticks at different times and not all at once. 

We ordered:

Salmon belly special - lightly seared and served sashimi style with salmon egg and sauces. Since I was the only one who ate this it might be the culprit. It was good.

Chicken Thigh Tare style - very good flavor. My first couple pieces here were so tender that maybe they weren't cooked through because I ordered a couple more of these sticks later and they weren't as tender. This might be the other culprit but this stick was shared.  

Umeshiso Yaki - w/sour plum and japanese basil. These were just ok, I wasn't wowed by the flavor and didn't order more later in the meal.

Pork belly tare style - absolutely delicious. I love pork belly and these didn't disappoint. 

Magic Mountain - salmon and cream cheese wrapped by soy paper and deep fried. This was delicious as well, a combination of my two favorites.

Beef Misozuke - This was actually one of the very first japanese yakitori meals that I'd ever had as a kid. This version was so-so...didn't have any flavors jumping out at me. 

Garlic Edaname - I believe this is fried in butter and garlic instead of steamed. It was really tasty. 

Overall, I'd come here again. I liked many items and saw many more on the menu to try. I'm a bit concerned with the quality control though.",2015-09-08 20:29:07

I had a great time when I paid for a day spa for my BFF/Bride-to-be and myself.  I thought that the location was well organized, relaxing and complete.  I felt very well taken care of both during the services we received and the down time between services.

Tonight I was priveleged to see the outcome of the renovations they had been doing at the time I was here last.  The area doubled in size and a few new services were added such as a hair salon.  The staff was super friendly, so gracious, and many of them were very curious about Yelp.  Heidi Lamar, the owner, was there to make sure that our every need and question was answered.

Our spa tasting included: hand paraffin dip, eyebrow waxing, chair massage, and makeup application.  Each one of the employees is very skilled in their trade as well as friendly and social.  I will definitely go back for these and other services.  The prices are a little expensive, but well worth it and not outrageous.  For example, a 55-minute massage will run about $100.

The restaurant was not too busy but it remained 90% full most of the time. As they have very limited seating, it's not an ideal place for large parties. 

The menu is not too big at Koi Sakana just like most Ramen restaurants but there is a good selection of different soup base and also quite a few vegetarian options. Snacks are also available for a good price. 

Curry Pork Cutlet Ramen
One of the most important thing about ordering a pork cutlet soup noodle is to have the pork cutlet served on the side in order to retain its crunchiness. Most other restaurants just serve the cutlet on top of the ramen and once it gets to the table, the breading is all soggy. However, Koi Sakana serves it on the side by default which is very thoughtful. The pork cutlet is fried to a perfect level of crunchiness. The broth on the other hand is very rich in curry flavour and goes together extremely well with the don katsu. 

Hokkaido Milk Broth Ramen
We were very excited to try the Hokkaido Milk Broth Ramen, as not many places have milk in their soup base.  And without a doubt this is the most amazing soup we have had that comes with ramen.  The broth was very milky and creamy, it would be even better if this ramen also comes with cheese.  The meat and ramen are average, it is not bad but nothing extraordinary.  Since other components of the ramen is average, we found that we spent alot of time drinking and indulging in the broth.

Pork Cartilage Ramen in House Broth
The house broth is a rich soup base filled with pork bone flavours. The ramen has a very good consistency (not too soft, not too hard) and the egg is boiled perfectly that part of the yolk is still runny. The pork cartilage is only average as some of the meat is way too chewy (perhaps overcooked?) while the actual cartilage is cooked to a perfect jelly texture. All in all, the ramen was not the best I had but pretty high in ranking.   

We definitely recommend this cozy ramen spot if you happen to live in the area and crave for some quality ramen. We would definitely return again and we'll be looking forward to new additions to the menu!",2015-07-24 03:06:04
1hKcVZ4TuurId1lB1Keotw,rnfgjemszUlQx6U_-PO63w,eU_713ec6fTGNO4BegRaww,2,3,1,1,"So many great reviews, so many wonderful comments I have read about this restaurant.  My neighbor personally recommended trying out La Tavola, and so I did.  As with the rest of Mt Washington, parking will either be a pain in the butt or valet.  I arrived at 9:00pm on a Friday night and was lucky enough to find close street parking.  

They appeared to have been fairly busy earlier in the day and night, but when I entered about half the tables were empty.  The interior was rather non-descript and I recognized the wall ornamentation from Ross and Marshalls.  We waited for about five minutes before we were seated.  This didn't bother me since all of the servers I saw were moving quick and making rounds to all of their tables and helping each other clean-up.  I was more worried that I would be sat at a table in a corner and lost in that shuffle.  Miraculously, we were sat a two-top in the middle of the entire main dining area.  

All of the servers were hustling and bustling and doing what they do and I saw people smiling and laughing with the exception of one that was just talking to one of his tables.  After 15 minutes of waiting and not seeing anyone, I did start to get a tad irritated.  I wondered if the only server that was talking with one of his tables rather than serving or helping the other servers was our server.  I started to stare in his direction and he looked at me a couple of times before something in his head clicked.  He came over and asked if we had been served and I told him no.  He left, returned in a few minutes and apologized.  He was our server.  As we had been waiting for 20 minutes, we new EVERYTHING that we wanted and ordered:

Pepsi
Tea with Lemon
Meatballs as an appetizer
Wedding Soup (in place of salad)
Veal Piccata (no mushrooms) with a side of potatoes 
Veal Parmagiana with linguine and red sauce

Our server seemed perturbed that we already knew what we wanted and didn't want to listen to the specials.  Not only did he have a poor attitude from his first contact, but he didn't write anything down.  I didn't order any additional appetizers due to those two facts.  Our server promptly disappeared and we didn't see him for another ten minutes.  I saw every other server in the place several times.  Some of them even stopped to help us and bring bread -- they were all very nice people.  We finally received our drinks -- a Pepsi for my friend and I.  I asked the server if I could have the tea I ordered. He apologized and said he didn't know how he could have forgotten since he had commented earlier on how the kitchen had just brewed a fresh batch.

And then the waiting started anew.  Our server didn't visit our table again for the next thirty minutes.  He would disappear.  He would stop and chat with other tables.  He would stand around and look as all of the other servers were running around, serving, and also helping to clean our server's tables.  He never helped with anyone else.  Thankfully the other servers refilled our drinks and brought bread to us.  We even managed to get the wedding soup from one of the other servers.  It was good.  It had more of a spinach flavor than many other Wedding soups I have eaten, but it was good.  Alas, we never saw our meatballs.

Our food finally arrived.  The serving sizes were a wonderful size.  I was really not liking our server; but that was fine since I had been craving a good piccata for some time.  I wasn't even perturbed by the fact that I had broccoli instead of the potatoes the server stated came with my meal.  As I dug in, I was left in dismay.  The piccata didn't taste of lemon, capers, or wine in any way.  It tasted like a heavy, flour gravy.  To top it off my food wasn't hot, but tepid or lukewarm.

I tried some of my friends veal parmagiana.  I then went to try some of his linguine to find that it was spaghetti.  I didn't hate it, but the red sauce had a weird aftertaste akin to the metallic aftertaste I get from artificial sweeteners.  I finished my food.

I saw several dessert trays being sent to a larger party in the room next door, and the desserts looked good.  I was by no means full and could have eaten more; but I just didn't want to have to deal with this server anymore.  I can't help but wonder if Rachel C. had the same server I had.  

So why I haven't I given 1 star?  A 1 star would mean that I would most likely never return, my friend didn't hate his food and I know that piccata is a difficult dish to make.  I think my experience was greatly colored by one of the worst servers I have ever had.  I will return at some point and make certain to try a different food and to get a different server.",2011-07-10 17:06:56

My wife got a lobster tail also that she was raving about. The prime rib is also cut table side with mashed potatoes and I added creamed corn and omg glad I did. My mouth was having organisms because of the amazing flavors of everything!!! Then they hit you with some bread for dipping into au jus. Lastly they brought us a amazing key lime bunt cake that was perfectly sweet and soft. I wanted to buy another to take home it was so good!

The decor is beautiful and I really like the vibe they're going for. (How many more times can I say ""like"" and ""really"" in a paragraph?) Unfortunately, Plancha is very expensive and very oily. I think I went the third day they opened, so I can see how the owners will keep learning and improving based on feedback and whatnot. 

Plancha should get on Ritual at some point because their line was absolutely INSANE. (I think it would also be better for them, since there are a million restaurants in the Financial District, and most of them are on some sort of mobile app anyway.) There were only 2 chefs in the back and waiting took a long LONG long time. Not only did you have to wait to order, but you also had to wait to get your order. I think I was in the restaurant for 30 minutes just waiting. 30 minutes is a crazy long time, especially since most people are on their 1-hour lunch break. I ordered the Power to the People plunch box with the organic spelt flatbread and added chicken. I also got a Plancha latte. (This doesn't seem to be on the menu anymore? It's just the not iced version of their latte.)  The total came out to be almost $25!!!! 

The organic spelt was delicious. I could just eat that all day and the first few bites of the Power to the People bowl were SO TASTY and seemed to be worth the price. But then you start getting to the bottom of the bowl, and you realize you've eaten/drank half a cup of oil. The oil was so heavy and I couldn't believe I was consuming so much of it. Look at all that oil stain in my picture! That's pretty nasty. The nasty oil took away a lot of my appetite. I didn't want to eat anything drowned in that, especially since all their food was supposed to be ""healthy"" and ""organic."" 

The Plancha latte was not that good either. I don't know if I was supposed to be drinking the lavender seeds? I thought the latte would just be infused with the seeds and then taken out. I didn't know my latte would have seeds in them. The taste was too overwhelming and I definitely did not like it. I first tried to take the seeds out, but there were too many of them! I ended up throwing it away, which was quite unfortunate since that latte was almost 7 dollars. 

I believe the oiliness came from the chicken though. I'm not sure.. if I were to come back, I wouldn't get any additions, though I probably would never come back to the restaurant because I don't work in the Financial District anymore. 

TLDR; Don't order the Plancha latte and don't add any additions to your box. That might be the source of the mysterious ocean of oil. I'm thinking a regular plunch box COULD be worth the price, but haven't tried that myself.",2018-03-19 22:32:37

Chicken Katsu is perfectly breaded and crispy. 
Curry flavour was nice. 
Kimchee is fragrant and sweetened with apples. 
Sushi rice served with meals is good. 
Meat portions are large for both Chicken Katsu and Hamburger dish. 
Decor is really nice. 

Needs Improvement:
Calamari breaking was puffy and tasteless. The accompanying chips acted as a plate filler. The chips tastes better than the Clamato. 
The hamburger was overly salty and had a burnt taste. Also seemed really greasy. 
Hungrier people will find that rice serving isn't enough.

But my first two questions alone confirmed the fact that having a sushi joint in the middle of the desert may have some issues.

Hows the toro? Sorry we dont serve toro during the summer time.
Ok, how about the halibut? No halibut here, only during winter.

So that's a great start there. And yes both items were on the menu; that's why I asked how they were. Oh well.

Anyways, I ordered some tuna nigiri http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=CTl0wonkUIRRANoVogG2BQ, salmon nigiri http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=BvZ7OBpRxsxtH0bF7KE1ug, albacore and yellowtail http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=grNHXCPTzT-ZLcDw75TgwA. They obviously used the best pieces here, nice, vibrant colors and fresh. The rice was a bit off though.

I also ordered their spicy salmon roll. Very hot, they pretty much drowned the fish in siracha sauce. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=HlM6L-jLtZEclnVUc_h2pg

The service here was neutral. I was the only person at the bar, and maybe like 10 other people in the dining area so it was pretty desolate as it is, but it took some time to get some decent service here.

Much like his other establishments, you can tell a lot of car has been placed into the decor, which provided an elegant, yet moody, vibe throughout the multiple dining rooms. 

So, don't be fooled by the (very cool) pawn shop entranceway. It's all part of the experience and only the first stop on your dining experience. If you're ever in Vegas, be sure to stop in.

Now, this place isn't Kosher or anything (hence ""Jew-ish""), but my PIC who is of the Chosen People has stated that this is probably one of the best places to get Jewish inspired food in Pittsburgh, and that's saying something from him.  Me, being a Shiksa and unfamiliar with this type of cuisine can't say the same.  However, I *AM* a lover of food, I can say with certaninty that it was pretty darn good.  I got the T.O.M. and even though I'm not eating bread at the moment, the brisket and kishka (think meatloaf shaped sausage thing) were excellent and drenched with this tasty, tasty gravy.

I have been to Vegas dozens of times and never would've known about this place if it weren't for my Yelp friend, Heather M's check-ins, photos, and review.  I finally made the drive, which is only about a 1/2 hour highway drive from the Vegas strip.  The GPS on my iPhone did a fine job of guiding me here. Once you arrive, simply follow the signs. There was a $7 fee, per car, for a one-time visit. An annual pass may be better for locals.

The 13-mile route is a oneway road, wide enough for 2 cars, however, there are no painted lines. If you're driving slowly, for whatever reason, be mindful. You may easily pull to the right side of the road and allow others to pass; this is what I did as we were sight-seeing. Once you're on the loop, you have to finish it; there is no turning around, as it's one-way only.

Try to go early enough so that you'll have time to visit each viewpoint/ pull-off.  We went around 6pm and only had time to stop and explore at the first one. I really enjoyed this one though. It was an easy hike to the rocks. The scenery was beautiful.  After 3 years of living in the desert, I had my first experience with a real, live, snake. Thankfully, a good samaritan noticed my head was in the air, not paying attention, so he warned me to watch out.  It was a long, yellow and black snake.  No one seemed to be alarmed, so I assume this snake was harmless, but I kept my distance all the same.

As we continued around the loop, the sun began to set, casting ravishing hues of red and orange on the rocks. Drive slowly; the roads are winding and there are some steep drop-offs. Take your time and enjoy the views safely.  

T-mobile service is 0-bare out here. It took a while for me to find a signal strong enough to allow me to check-in.

The listed hours on Yelp indicate they're only open until 4:30pm. That is only for the visitor's center.  You may still drive and hike the 13-mile loop until 8pm or 8:30pm (verify upon arrival).

Worth the drive and the entrance fee. If I lived in Vegas, this would be my workout place.  Beautiful and quiet/peaceful.  Great spot for yoga and/or meditation. Bring a camera; like, a real camera.",2016-06-04 20:29:32

They oftentimes are there for the simple notion of enjoying a themed meal with cute servers and entertaining atmosphere.  

Thankfully, when I stopped by Anime Ramen &Teriyaki Cafe a few days ago, I had an overall pleasant experience thanks in part to a clean establishment with chirpy, ""genki""-esque girls, and pretty decent food.

The angle here of course is Anime.  Giant prints hang on the walls from anime ""Japanese Animation"" work such as Kenshin, Naruto, Bleach, and other popular titles.  Thank God I'm in my twenties and not in my teens because if I was in my teens I would have lost my mind and been here all. the. time.  

I tried the teriyaki sliders, the pork based noodle bowl, and iced tea, which was an original mix of theirs.  The tea was pretty decent, the sliders were excellent, nicely presented, and the pork bowl was flavourful, with good chunks of meat with Udon noodles (Which was presented as a choice.)  The sliders were definitely the best feature of my meal.  I'm a Pho kind of guy and I prefer Pho over Ramen as it's more flavourful and healthier (depending on the venue as far as salt is concerned.)

I wanted boba tea but they were out of boba so that was a no-go.  Apparently they also have a liquor license on the way so we'll see how that goes over.  

Service was a litle scattered but otherwise very pleasant.  The servers are adorable girls in wigs who greet and see you out with the typical Japanese phrases, (although ordering in Japanese doesn't work, so don't try to show off your skills if you hanasemasu Nihongo.)  They managed to talk me into trying the Honey Toast, (which after, despite my love for Ichiza, I have tried and disliked due to how overly sweet and how you can only enjoy 1/3 of the actual toast), which was really good!  Think of it as Honey French Toast, every bit is edible and it's less to deal with.  

So, that said: I was quite pleased with Anime & Ramen Cafe but there is room for improvement being that the business is all of three weeks old:  

-I would like to see a better pacing to my meal i.e. if I order appetizer and meal, I'd like the appetizer to arrive prior to my actual meal.  

-My water refills were a little slow and I had all three waitresses, minutes within each other attempt talk me into dessert, even after the first waitress talked me into it.  

-A football game on the monitor?  Seriously?  People come here to get their geek on, don't put on anything else but programs pertaining to this scene.

While the selection of food for an Izakaya is a bit smaller, the food itself makes up for it. The set up of the restaurant is also split into two sections, alcohol and no alcohol.

We regularly order the Takoyaki which is usually pretty good. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside with a piece of octopus inside. 

My favourite dish is their Osaka Cha-Han which is an octopus fried rice. It's covered in the same sauce that the Takoyaki is made of which is sweet and tangy and is absolutely delicious.

Another highlight is the Negitoro-don which is a rice dish with diced pieces of raw tuna that you pour soy sauce and wasabi over. The tuna is fresh and the wasabi provided is real wasabi and not just paste.

Service is always friendly at this restaurant and food comes at a pretty good pace. If the restaurant is busy though, be prepared to wait a little longer for your food.

That's when a restaurant throws in a communal table, brings back old school classics like deviled eggs as an appetizer, and/or covers bacon in chocolate on their dessert menu. 

Beckett's Table does all three, so people are obviously going to lose their shit over it. 

Let me break it down for you. Beckett's is fine. The meal will be pleasing, but it's overpriced for the execution:

The wait time for one drink will make it really hard to get a buzz on. If money is going to be spent on dinner, then that money wants to get drunk. Okay, not drunk, lightly buzzed ... still be able to drive. (Bad Teacher anyone? Cameron Diaz? Nope? Just me?)

The Osso Buco is an Osso-bummer. No marrow in the bone, just a hollowed out disappointment. 

The Prime Flat Iron steak is served with literally 3 leaves from a brussels sprout and about just as many small potato halves. You really need to love meat to get this, because it's all you're getting. Also, don't expect it to be medium rare. Two people ordered it this way at my table and neither one got it medium rare.

That's about as A-Ok as you can get, right? Hipster Hype, you can't fool me with your charming farmhouse inspired interior. 

Even my beloved Deviled Eggs were over-hyped. The only thing I felt was deserving of 5 stars was the service. The waiter was fantastic. Spot on.

You know, it may be complicated to give me a real life orgasm, but it ain't that hard to give me a food-gasm. Now that's just a fact.",2014-12-04 17:19:01
MUW9feDi0w21_x4T8vbCoQ,vCYPAeCFE7W5tdn7fVtsBw,T2tEMLpTeSMxLKpxwFdS3g,4,0,1,0,"Cabo Fish Taco, in general, is a decent establishment. Although I have conflicting opinions on various food choices offered, the restaurant atmosphere usually makes up for any setback. 

First off, the fish tacos... very well crafted. If you're a fan of fish tacos, you really can't go wrong with these. I've been out to this place about three times now and have come to realize it's a safe bet. My favorite (although I really haven't tried any others) is the Wasabi Fish Taco, which as you may have figured, has that perfect combination of sweet and spicy flavor. In my opinion, it is still on the mild side.

Now contrary to the fish tacos, are their burritos. Fail. These are basically meals you could easily put together yourself- wrap, a can of re-fried beans, mixed with some other ingredients that just don't make up for the overpowering sense of eating at a Taco Bell. Not that there is anything wrong with Taco Bell, but simply put, you are basically paying Cabo $10.29 for a near synonymous $.99 bean burrito from Taco Bell. And burrito size? Probably less than half of what you'd expect an authentic Mexican restaurant to serve you. 

Lastly, atmosphere. The restaurant has a great layout and usually has a great crowd. Well decorated. The ambient noise can be a little much at times with the acoustics set up as such- a lot of hard wood, metal, etc.

Overall, I would REALLY rate a 3.5 if could. Ideally, if all your looking for is a place to go to have a few drinks with friends, get some food (knowing you want a fish taco, of course), this place is definitely worthy of your time.",2012-09-20 12:36:12

He usually works overnights so it is rare that we have a day off together. I will say that last Friday was the day that the stars aligned and we were able to enjoy a nice lunch out on the town. We wanted to do something new and something that we haven't tried before. Since we both work and live in the Lawrenceville/Bloomfield area we wanted to go outside of our comfort zone. I was working at Mercy and on my way to Shadyside was just voice texting him restaurants that I was passing on Forbes Ave. Of course he was sleeping and did not get the texts until later but once he did he said that Buford's Kitchen seems nice. I agreed. What is weird is that as an elite Yelper I actually did not read any of their reviews other than to use the app to send him the address. I was astounded to see that after we went their it has such a negative Yelp status. Honestly, that is CRAZY to me. Greg and I had a wonderful time here. The staff was so helpful and nice, the restaurant was super clean, and the food was fantastic. We even ordered drinks and they not only came out quickly when I was asking about a beer Greg ordered the waitress brought over the bar manager to tell me a little bit about it. What great service!!

The waitress we had took the time to go over her favorites and the best sellers of the restaurant. She was wonderful. And all of our picks were spot on because of her.

Appetizer:

Fried Green Tomato with Remoulade Sauce, Scallion Aioli. There were 4 slices of tomatoes on the platter that came out. They were drizzled with the remoulade and aioli and they were delish. I think that the tomatoes could have been a bit of a thicker slice but overall they were filling. I think also for the price there could have been maybe double the amount of tomatoes on the plate. Green tomatoes are not that expensive and with them being so thin, add a few more to the plate!

Andouille Gumbo: This was dang tooting good. I think I could have licked the plate clean and I even mentioned to the waitress to not be shocked if she saw me licking the bowl. The rue that the gumbo was made in was spot on, the sausage tasted amazing, and the who experience was magnificent. I had a cup, should have went with a bowl.

Main Course:

I ordered the Po' Boy for my main food. Because if you are going to try the southern restaurant you better have a heck of a good po' boy. I picked the Oyster po' boy because oysters are one of my favorite foods and fried oysters as just amazing. The po' boy came with lettuce, tomato, mayo, and pickles. I added extra tomatoes and onions to my sandwich because I am difficult and I love tomatoes and onions. I will say that standard the sandwich comes with fries, The waitress said we could sub it out for any of the sides on the menu. Again this is where good service comes in. I asked her how the coleslaw was because I am a bit of a coleslaw snob. I do not like like weird coleslaw or slaw that is made with miracle whip (which is disgusting in my book). She went to the back and got me a little serving dish of the coleslaw for me and Greg to try. That is wonderful service. I hated it so was grateful for her allowing me to try it out. I went with the mixed veggies instead. I will say, I asked what the veggies were and she told me broccoli, carrots, and something else. When it came out it was just zucchini, squash, and onions. Not at all my jam. I ate them and looked longingly at Greg's fries. I would not have picked that as a nice side veggie to eat but since I ate all the fried food, it was ok. I will also say that the veggies were caked in butter. They must be steamed or cooked in a ton of butter. I was a little taken aback by the amount of butter in the bowl, but just kind of went with it. 

The service and the food were wonderful. I would come back any day. I think that it is a nice little lunch spot and the service is excellent. I look forward to eating some more of their meals!",2017-08-04 03:41:29

It felt cozy and I was glad it was nearly empty because this place is probably a hipster lightning rod. The only other customers were two middle-aged ladies.

""Nutritious"" is how you politely describe something that tastes exactly like you should've expected it to taste, and that's how my friend described her Superfood Smoothie, which came with almond milk, banana, sunflower sprouts, spinach, goji berries, cacao, maca, hemp protein.

I, on the other hand, had the least healthy smoothie I could find. Something that resembled an Oreo shake, but I can't seem to find it on their online menu. It was delicious. 

My friend had the salad, which was a salad and that's really all that needs to be said. I had the Rawitch, a sandwich with guacamole, tomatoes, cucumbers, alfalfa sprouts and balsamic vinaigrette. I don't know how they make the onion bread, but it was not exactly bonded together. It fell apart quickly and things got messy.  However, the taste was pretty good.

In the spirit of trying as much as I could, we got the banana cream pie. The flavour is not very complex. It tasted like a bunch of mashed bananas frozen into shape. I enjoyed it though, and if you like bananas, you'll probably like this too.

Got two ""regulars"" with ketchup and a side of fries with chili and cheese.

The two hot dogs were perfectly grilled and it comes on Aunt Hattie's brand buns - my favourite. I ordered the buns grilled too but because my order was taken by about three different people, that didn't happen. The chili seemed like Hormel brand without beans, but it was great. The side that came with my ""chili cheese fries"" was more than enough to also pour over my hot dogs. If you're getting dogs and fries, just order one side of each and it'll be plenty.

Bubble tea (or boba), sweets, clay pots, popcorn chicken, indescribable Chinese snacks indigenous to the South of China, and herbal teas that somehow I suspect isn't all that herbal. 
The decor is atrocious, makes absolutely no sense. No theme, but well lit. Trendy ambiance, almost as if it was inspired by some stock photography picture. Not worth mentioning. The menu is not for serious foodies, but some of the sweets such as the pudding is rich and uniquely delicious. 
Complimentary purple (not as good as the white one) pudding is offered to all patrons. The toast is something among their prettiest dishes, and possibly the biggest you'll ever see.  
I would forego the clay pot rice dishes, as most of the rice is stuck onto the clay pot, and the edible portion is quite hard in texture. The popcorn. The popcorn chicken is frozen packaged. Don't ask me how I know.

Very friendly service from the staff. Reasonable prices for 'cute' food. 
As mentioned, I do only come here to meet people. Specifically female people. I spare them of the horrendous sight of my eating Chinese food. Instead, I adopt a sense of civility, which is made easy by the dishes here designed not to be devoured. Cute food is meant to be consumed cutely. 

I see people of my past, present, and perhaps even future. I see them all here each time I visit. This is the only restaurant that I bump into people that I know of, constantly.

Brought here for a cute little date night, the mister ordered for us (since he had been here before). We didn't really do our usual his/hers order, but shared everything:

We ordered:
- CRISPY EGG ROLLS: Four fried eggrolls cooked to perfection served with large lettuce leaves with all the fixins like pickled carrot and mint leaves. Wrap an eggroll with the lettuce, sprinkle some of the garish and dip in the side sauce. The perfect appetizer!
- THE ORIGINAL WHOLE MAINE LOBSTER PHO: This is listed as market price and was about 50$, but so worth it if you are a lobster lover! A generous 1.5 lbs whole maine lobster in a yummy lobster pho broth with rice noodles. A foodie must try!
- CRISPY BIRD'S NEST NOODLE: Chicken, beef, shrimp, fishballs and assorted vegetables on top of a full plate bed of crispy noodles, softened by a delicious gravy. This was so good and filling, and only 14.99!

Everything was not only presented well, but was extremely full of flavor. We left full and satisfied for sure! Service was good as well... And would we return again? Oh, absolutely! 

Maybe the only downfall was we waited for seating for a good 20 minutes despite there being a lot of seating. I originally asked if a booth was available and the hostess told me she would let me know. 5 minutes later she asked if we still wanted to wait for a booth or were okay with a table, as there still were none. I said, ""Oh okay, a table is fine!"" She comes back another 15 minutes later and asks us the same question. -___-",2017-09-28 19:27:16

How about the PA announcer who can't speak English?  You would think an airport would have someone speaking very clear and slow.  CLE puts someone in this posistion who is not qualified for the job. Did I just get off a plane in Egypt or Cleveland?  

Lets talk about the people movers connecting the C and D concourses. The airport used to brag about how the walkway was the longest underground airport tunnel in the world. That hasnt been brought up in years due to the embarassment of the moving escalators always been broken. I counted one being closed down for 24 days. Not even kidding.  I love the reactions when people have to walk a quarter mile pulling their bag on carpet.

How about the food???  They force the excellent Banjoes Cafe out of sight and bring in chains ran by citizens enrolled in the workers release program. If you don't know what that is just google it. I used to hear numerous stories about the old Burger King employees joy in urinating on the grills. Good luck getting any customer service or smiles at these new food choices.

Those of you commenting on the new Terrazzo floor.  They had to do it. The carpetting had 17 years of black mold built into it. CLE makes it sound like they are doing the traveler a favor by pulling it up, while health issues have forced them to. The fact that someone thought it was a good idea to have carpeting in the first place tells all about the management. Great idea Hopkins.

I haven't even touched on the airport operations aspect.  Trust me I could go on for hours.  Belivie it or not I'm actually a very positive person.  This place just pisses me off.  Topping it off you will get to here some wonderful 1990's hits.

I am surprised this finally happen. I was looking for Vietnamese food and thought why not try this small restaurant on campus. The food pics looked amazing, however I was quite surprised when i came in and found no Vietnamese food at all on the menu. They must have changed owners and kept the restaurant name. There was very traditional asian noodle dishes i.e. beef and noodle with cilantro and a clear broth. I was not expecting anything amazing, but the flavors were simply off the wall. The broth itself was clear and seasoned well. I did not have the post MSG or salt thirstiness after dinner so it might be actual broth made with chicken. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the seasoned beef slices had the right tenderness. After eating all of the noodles, i wanted to drink all of the soup. Hands down one of the best classic beef chinese noodle soup. It reminds you of the famous Taiwanese beef noodle dish! I will definitely be back. 

Pros: inexpensive, fresh ingredients, great soup/broth

Cons: very small tables, hard to find restaurant (tucked away on the side of the building)

Of course I did what I would always do and used trusted Yelp to find nearby restaurants. Old School was a short walk away (especially important in the stifling humidity) and we were able to walk there quickly and be seated right away. 

I was immediately impressed by the feel of the place. The music was great, and the black and white murals and banquettes and metal tiled ceilings give a fun but polished feel to the space. On this scorcher of a day, it took a while to cool down even while seated indoors (aka air conditioning was not very strong, and I'm not a person who likes it very cold!). But with the blinds pulled down, the area we were seated at cooled down.

I had wanted to try their lavender lemonade but they were out of the ingredients required to make it. Their fountain drinks are mixed in house and have a minimal number of ingredients compared with the store-bought sodas. The server mixed up a lemonade for me, which was deliciously refreshing. 

The menu consist of a lot of comfort foods like barbecue, sandwiches, salads, burgers, grilled cheese, and other brunch type items. I ordered the Mac and cheese cobbler (which our server Cam assured me was delicious and large enough to be a main despite being listed as one of their sides). Hubby ordered The Little Pig, which consists of brisket, slaw, potato salad.  OMG! The Mac and cheese was creamy, cheesy, noodles perfectly al dente -- like a warm hug (perhaps not the lightest food option for such a hot day). Sure enough, the portion was very shareable and I was only able to eat half of it before packing the rest to go.  It is that filling! Hubby's brisket was very flavourful & juicy, and served with potatoes and a green salad. 

Service was fantastic. Cam our server was attentive and funny.  I would definitely go back to try some of the crazy yummy sounding items from their ""Mama can't make this"" section of their menu, like the cheesecake stuffed egg bread rolled in toasted coconut, whipped cream and orange honey drizzle called Don't Even Go There!

I'll say that on that level I would have given a 2 rating. However, several redeeming factors ensued or precluded the fish incident. 

For starters their clam chowder isn't to bad at all. In fact it's about a 4 on it's own...OK good start - and those cute Oyster crackers (they have to count for at least a half star).

The fries and tartar sauce were up to 'relative par', I especially like the crispy bits and pieces at the bottom of the basket, and the sauce flavourful enough to eat on its own.
  
Unfortunately, as I mentioned at the open - this trip the fish was well undercooked, glassy and somewhat clear - you know the look. 

Our server did have it changed (mentioning to the cooks to cook it more in the future - not just my order), however, the new order came back less cooked than I'd like, yet enough to eat and not bring up the previous layers of food already eaten.

The two bartenders that we've had the pleasure of being served by are Brian & Rowena.  They are on top of everything.  Extremely friendly, helpful, knowledgeable...so good at what they do.

Brian seems to be a masterful bartender... (not knocking Rowena in any way) One evening we went in and he had...on his own... before work, bought rhubarb at the Kings Rd. Farmers Market.

While we were there he was chopping it up & sent it back to the kitchen for them to reduce it to a simple syrup.  He generously made us a drink with this super-tasty syrup and a bit of aperol & something else.  It was soooo good!  A bright, refreshing, summer cocktail!

The appetizers (1/2 price in the early evening) are soooo good.  The calamari is lightly battered and lightly fried, but it's long tenders of the calamari. (so if you don't like the little, crunchy octopus babies - no worries)

The Thai Chili Shrimp is good and the Crab Dip is so full of large chunks -omg- more, please.

For our appetizers, we ordered Calamari and Ahi Tuna Tartar. For our mains, we both ordered Filet Mignon with Mashed Potatoes and Broccolini on the side to share. We were expecting high quality food based on the reviews and the price for everything we ordered, but we were in for a surprise.

After placing our orders, the waiter came back in less than 5 minutes with the Calamari. We were surprised at how fast it came out because usually it should take at least 15 minutes to freshly prepare a new batch, especially at a high-end restaurant. The calamari wasn't hot, fresh or crispy. The texture was more on the soggy side, as if the calamari was sitting out and just reheated. Definitely a bad start to our meal. The Ahi Tuna Tartar was another terrible dish, worse than the calamari for sure. The Ahi Tuna was warm and the flavours of the sauce were just bad. 

Now for the Filet Mignon, we both ordered our steaks medium rare and the outer edges were fine but the center of the steak was too raw for us, and the outside crust of the steak was really dry and overcooked. One thing I noticed when eating my steak was that I tasted a lot of curry flavour. I'm not sure if the steak was meant to have a curry taste, but I definitely tasted it and it wasn't pleasant at all. No steak should be served with curry flavour unless it was stated directly on the menu.

We had a terrible dining experience at Harbour Sixty and we couldn't understand how this restaurant received many great reviews. Either the chef on duty was severely slacking that day or that this is the norm for the restaurant. We've been to several high-end restaurants and never have we experienced such distasteful food, especially the extra added curry flavour on the steak. It's extremely unbelievable at how much money we spent on poor quality food. I don't recommend this restaurant to anybody considering it because there are tons of steakhouses, such as Jacobs & Co Steakhouse, that offer top quality food at almost the same price.",2015-01-26 17:38:56

The service was great, restaurant was clean and cozy. We used the Yelp checkin offer for the free hummus and now I'll never look at my store bought Sabra hummus the same way again. This hummus was so smooth and creamy, I've been dreaming about it since my visit. The hummus was served up with warm pita bread, fresh from the oven, and a perfect accompaniment. I've never seen pita the way they present it here: puffed up. It was eye catching.

We also tried some of the traditional Lebanese fare from the entree menu: kafta, frarej, and dolmas. All were delicious, except maybe too citrusy from all the lemon they use in the cooking, especially in the frarej. It was hard to focus on any other flavors that might have been present because their was so much lemon. For dessert, we tried the shabiet and rice pudding. The shabiet was pretty good, but if you're thinking a bout the rice pudding, just be warned that it's prepared with rose water and if you're not used to floral tastes, it might be too strong for you.

Of the few places we've tried, the quality of food and level of service just doesn't justify the price. Our last venture to Geisha House (which is terrible in my opinion) a while back had turned me off on seeking out other similar restaurants. But when some friends invited us out to Ohjah on two separate occasions, I think I may have had a slight change of heart.

This Ohjah location, which is one of three in town, is located on Rainbow & Lake Mead directly across from the Best In The West shopping center. Inside, you'll find a very typical hibachi setup. Aside from an area with booths for those who want to do maybe just sushi only, there's an entirely separate room setup exclusively for hibachi. It's basic, but it's nice, and they keep it extremely clean.

The menu here is quite extensive. Besides the hibachi dinners, they have offer a ton of different stuff. They've got everything from entrees and bowls, to a long list of rolls and other sushi types, even a handful of Thai dishes. I was to surprised to see they even offer boba drinks as well.

If you are going for hibachi though, they do require that everyone in your party order from that menu. The basic setup is about $9, but includes a soup of your choice, salad and then grilled veggies and your choice of noodles, or one of a few different rice styles. Meat add ons run anywhere from just over $6 for chicken, all the way up to nearly $50 for Kobe beef. You're also able to mix and match if you want multiple items, or to add on seafood, like salmon, scallops, lobster, shrimp, etc. It's basically limitless and there's options for really anyone. 

I've now tried their chicken, steak and scallops alongside fried rice. The rice was cooked very well, but I'm not a fan of the way they serve everything. First you get rice, then veggies, and then finally your meet. The rice and veggies are bound to start getting cold before the meat comes, but it is what it is. All the add-ons I tried have been fairly decent with the scallops surprisingly being my favorite. They were seared well, and not overdone. Both the chicken and steak were just above average, but nothing that stands out as excellent.

I also have ordered a couple different types of nigiri and have been mostly unimpressed. The garlic tuna was way overpowered and the hamachi didn't appear to be very fresh. They aren't bad for the price though, and I have to give the chef credit for putting together a special avocado nigiri for the misses who hates seafood. 

Of course, with hibachi, it's all about the chef and the experience. We've had Tony & Nick, who are both excellent! They are very interactive and do some really clever things while they work. I love that they get the youngins involved in the fun too. It's much appreciated and so fun to watch. And I mean c'mon, how can you not have fun while trying to catch flying shrimp with your mouth?  

The servers are also very friendly, and really stay on top of everything. Glasses barely get half full before someones there to refill, and they just downright do a good job. 

It can get pricey here quickly, but Ohjah is a solid 3.5 stars when it comes to the food. With excellent service and a memorable experience though, I'm rounding it up to a 4. They're definitely worth checking out!",2015-01-09 06:41:36

BBQ pork rice noodle roll with green onion (4/5)
The rice noodle is smooth and chewy though a little bit thick to my standard. There are quite a lot of BBQ pork inside the rice noodle but I can't find any green onion though.

bean curb skin with mushrooms and chinese herbs roll (3/5)
It looks good and is stuffed with a lot of vegetables but a bit too salty. 

 shrimp dumplings (4.5/5)
This is good and delicious. The only drawback is the wrap is a bit thick to my standard.

deep fried savoury glutinous dumpling (4/5)
The outside is crispy and inside is chewy. The sticky rice stuffing with the meat is chewy and tasty. It is very filling.

In general the dishes are good.",2018-09-29 14:26:57

For the most part, it does its job with easing the stomach if you're starving after a night of alcohol (like myself) and if there's nothing else open.

For the food, it was mediocre at best and a little overpriced. I ordered the corned beef hash which wasn't terrible but for the cost, the portion was very small. Little cubes of corn beef hash really doesn't cut it for $16. However, the corn beef was flavorful and really made the dish along with the eggs. The potatoes needed a touch up on seasoning. Nothing some salt and pepper couldn't fix though.

I didn't come in with high expectations and knew the possibility of tasting nothing ground breaking as I've been to many places just like this. Though small, the corn beef (meat alone) and the service earns this three stars in my opinion. The prices need some work for what you're receiving.

Is it an effort to capture the artsy-fartsy joie de vivre of Manhattan's neighborhood's namesake? Lord, I hope not. The restaurant is located across from PNC Park in just about the least artsy-fartsy neighborhood of Pittsburgh. But I guess Post-Game Drunken Fratboy Hangout doesn't really have a good ring to it.

Is it a nod to Pittsburgh's very own SoHo? Lord, I hope not. The restaurant has far more glam than the rundown neighborhood trapped between Duquesne University and South Oakland. But I guess Depressing Shithole doesn't have a good ring to it, either.

Whatever the story behind its namesake is a moot point upon experiencing the restaurant's fare. Here's what you can expect:

1. Meh food. The SoHo steak and cheese is essentially chopped steak and Cheez Whiz on a bun. It's not particularly delicious. The fries were good, though.

2. Outstanding drinks. Perfectly priced, elegantly presented, and expertly mixed. The Cinnamon Toast Crunch martini is ridiculously delicious. Honest to God, it tastes like a friggin' bowl of the cereal. Except with alcohol.

The Lady Silvia is a sweet little speakeasy located on the street level of ultrachic SOHO Lofts. It opened I think fall 2011, still few people know about it. 

Enter Lady Silvia from Hoover St, near Resnick's Grocery. We always find street parking, but it looks like you can park in a flat lot across Hoover St. Upon entering, you are met with a Please No Smoking sign. 

It seems to me the main customers of Silvia are the denizens of SOHO Lofts. Secondary audience, I think, is the artsy-fartsy crowd -- I heard about Silvia through my ubertrendy art cluster. 

I've been only a couple of times and both times, it was relatively slow. The bar entertained near it's max capacity of twelve, but the table seating (of maybe 40 tops) had only two parties of two. I don't know if it ever gets crazy busy, but the times I've been there, it's been a mellow place to hang out and just talk either with a date or a medium-size group of friends. 

The theme is kind of like The Library [bar] in NY. The longest walls are stuffed with old legal texts, encyclopedias, year books, etc, and a couple mounted flat screens. At the far end is the DJ booth, though the music isn't so loud you can't hear your party talk about the latest American Apparel ad campaign. Don't expect to find a dance crowd; this is a loungey lounge. 

The high ceilings are adorned with spray paint, looking like Basquiat did the honors after being forced to take Lithium for a year. 

The furnishings are very World Market Center. Gilded Rococo chairs with pops of sick neon green, acrylic chairs, curly elaborate fixtures, and the like. Unusual color combinations that seem to work.

After about an hour and no show, I called them back. They said they normally only operate on the strip and in Henderson and that they hadn't gotten a driver to take the call yet. By the way, the destination was even further from the strip than my house.

Why didn't they tell me that from the start. They had my address and knew where I lived. I said fine, just let me know when you're coming. In the meantime I called another cab company. They said 40 minutes to an hour so I figured I'd just wait.

After about another hour went by, I called them again. They said they still didn't have a driver taking the call. They asked If I had called another cab company and when I said yes, ""only to get an estimate on time"". Whittlesea stated, ""you can't do that"".

Anyway, I got a call from my mechanic stating they couldn't wait anymore around 4:30 p.m. I had to call Whittlesea back to tell them forget it. At that time they still didn't have a driver assigned.

How much do you want to bet if I told them my destination was the strip, I could have gotten somebody. Guess what, in the customer service industry sometimes you have to take jobs that don't always pay as much.  

I told them I'd have to pick my truck on on Monday and sure the hell wouldn't call them for that  to take me anywhere, EVER.

I switched rooms three times. 

The first room, in the older tower, had peeling paint, tiles falling off the wall in the bathroom, a strong sulphur smell in the water and a wall shaking noise coming through the wall that kept me awake through the night.

Room 2, in the habitat tower, wasn't much better repair. Too bad it had a cockroach family in the bathroom.

Room 3, back in the old tower, was run down but quiet. So quiet that another cockroach family decided to put a larval sac on the side of the bed so I could watch the next generation being born (pictured).

No one seemed surprised that I was sharing my rooms with cockroaches. They comped me one day of resort fees for the 'inconvenience"".

The Flamingo is visibly aging. Public areas are in disrepair, everywhere smells of cigarette smoke even if a non-smoking area, elevators are rickety and unreliable, stairwells are filthy. The staff are nice and don't  seem even a little surprised that there are roaches in the rooms.

A midnight excursion felt more like I was in a bar that Canadians would find to be a frustrating typical American experience. Boys were drinking too hard, sloshing their conversations and breaking glasses. While that midnight booth-ing was overall really nice, with attentive service, the music didn't match the sequence. Then, New Year's morning it was a casual, comfortable brunch scene. They had steak & eggs on the menu. And it wasn't a pan-griddle cheap cut, it was a filet. They have tea -- tea type tea, not cold tea -- so if you're not in the mood to drink you can still enjoy their expansive, indulgent menu. Breakfast poutine of tater tots drenched in duck fat gravy & bison belly. And I have a feeling there's a bouncer considering it's next to Jilly's. Sure it's off putting at first, but really that's likely a good idea with what's happening out on that corner. The only corner in my Canadian experience thus far that reminded me of the states.

It says at the bottom of their menu in small print that everyone in your party MUST order the same thing. Meaning if one person wants the additional AYCE Dungeness crab for an extra $6.00, everyone at that table will be charged an extra $6.00, just a heads up. 

Friends and I went during the Soft Opening late night to check it out. Location is meh, there's limited parking in the front of the joint and the place itself isn't super nice or fancy. However when you walk in most of the seating is bars-style with some booths on the side for larger parties. 

Since it was the soft opening I was not expecting TOO much from them. The conveyer belt had little labels that go around saying what sushi would be there. They barely had any though. You had to your waiter that you want freshwater eel or else you were gonna be waiting til forever lol. The selection of fish wasn't that much either. You got your regular salmon and tuna nigiris of course, mackerel, shrimp, yellowtail and freshwater eel is what I remembered going around yet there was barely any to take. But when you do request for certain foods from your waiter, he will either bring it to you or it gets delivered on the cute little train device that goes straight to your table on the conveyer belt. If you've ever been to Sapporo then you know what I'm talking about!

Aside from the fish, there were also entries you could order which includes the Dungeness crab. The crab was pretty good, not sure if I would pay extra $6 for it again though cuz it was a hassle cracking it open and getting little bit of meat. 

Service was ok. I asked them twice for a cup of ice for my can of coke and they forgot up until we were done eating. For the most part everyone was friendly and attentive when it came to picking up dirty plates.

Actually, my main reason for coming to this place was because I wanted to try the fried chicken, which is coated with a layer of fried ramyun. With regards to the chicken, I think it's kind of a cool idea and props to them for trying something different, but I actually didn't like it. The ramyun coating is super hard and crunchy, and while I get that some people might like that, it just wasn't my thing. It just made it kind of difficult to get at the actual chicken meat, and overall took away from my enjoyment. The flavour wasn't bad, but I've had much better at a few other places, so I can't say I was impressed. I forget what bowl of noodles I got, but it ended up being HUGE... and definitely could have fed two people. It just felt like an endless bowl of instant noodles, and I couldn't even finish, especially after eating like 2 pieces of the fried chicken. This is one of those restaurants that is maybe worth trying once if you're really curious about the chicken, but not really worth any repeat visits.",2016-01-08 19:36:25

The beef with sauteed onions au jus was very good.

Also tried was the Raj India Pale Ale. This brew was more in keeping with the English tradition of IPA rather than American hyper hopped IPAs.  I would describe it as ""okay"" but not a superlative experience.

This location is just like all the other Lowe's you've been to, but I will say that they have extremely helpful staff here. Once you're able to track down an employee, they will do whatever they can to help you with your project. (It would be nice to have more employees walking around the store, looking for people like me who need help! Sometimes it's difficult to find someone to assist me.) 

Recently I dealt with the returns department because I bought a misting fan a few months ago and the motor already died. I was friendly but not necessarily the easiest customer to deal with. I wanted to the leave store with a replacement fan that day, rather than a giftcard or a refund. I ended up working with an employee and her supervisor to come up with a solution. I really appreciate that they were able to process my return without sending me to the 800 number, and they even let me take the floor model because they didn't have any other units in stock. They were patient and understanding, and truly wanted to provide a positive customer experience! 

My only complaint isn't really directed at the employees or this location. A lot of the items they sell are made cheaply and break after a few uses (or even when installing the items!). I don't always buy the most expensive equipment so it's understandable that the quality can be less than superior, but why do they even stock cheaply-made items that are doomed to break? Thankfully the returns department is pretty good about taking items back (just hang on to your receipt!). 

PS. They offer a guarantee on plants - I believe it's one year. Perfect for someone who kills a lot of plants... just bring the dead plant and your receipt, and they'll refund you! 

PPS. Wish they had a service where you can track your purchases with your credit card or phone number. It would make returning items even easier. Requiring paper receipts for a return is so old school!",2015-08-13 14:22:11

That being said, the quality is sub-par.  The ingredients taste fine but it's not heated up enough so it's just a warm burrito at best.  The hot sauce is nowhere near hot.  They have bottles of hot sauce on the tables which I poured into the burrito with every bite.  

The only redeeming factor is they retained the decor from the previous sandwich deli and is very spacious and clean for a burrito place.

I have been here a few times and even invited family/friends from Colorado to eat here when the visited Ohio. The first few visits here have been enjoyable so I'm glad I waited for my review here.  This LAST trip though was anything but professional and courteous.  
     First off, we arrived just after noon about 12:15 pm and there was no one at the front counter but a radio playing the current rap and pop music station.  We are standing at the front waiting for someone to seat us as the sign implied and a hostess I believe quietly asked us from across the other end of the bar, ""Only two of you?"".  I looked at my roommate and then back at the hostess because I wasn't sure that's what she said and she asked this same question just slightly louder from across the other end of the bar.  
We replied, ""Yes"".  
     From across the bar she picked up two menus from where she was standing, turned around and away from us saying what I believed to be, ""Follow me, I'll seat you.""   Rude on so many levels!  
   The ""hostess"" we had to catch up to literally picked the table right behind where she was sitting at the bar for us.  Not a big deal right now but this whole ""visit"" gets worse.  MUCH worse.  
    Hostess placed the menus down and said, ""Your server will be with you in a moment.""  She didn't ask if we wanted any water or anything to that extent.  
  The bartender apparently is also a server as she walked up to us and asked what we would like to drink.  We both asked for hot tea.  This was a mistake because that bartender must have NEVER made tea with a tea pot before because she filled that tea pot to very top with water so much so that I could see the water in the spout of the tea pot.  She laughed and said, ""Yeah, I filled it up a lot so you could share it!""  Excuse me?  As soon as we pour the tea pot it will spill!  She didn't care about that, or even ask if we wanted anything else, like water, and literally disappeared for a moment in the back before coming out the bar again.  Before the bartender came back though, the hostess thought this would be a WONDERFUL time to take a break behind the bar and eat lunch or something at the bar table where the employees work and pour drinks!!!  Also, I have never been to an Asian restaurant with rap/pop music playing and BET playing Fresh Prince of Bel Air on TV.  I honestly don't mind this music or TV but this is supposed to be a relaxing place to eat.  NOT SO.  This music and television choice was obviously for the employees enjoyment and not the customers because the hostess was sitting/standing behind the bar table eating lunch and watching TV.  
   The bartender came back and took our order for food.  We both ordered Miso soup followed by the Pad Thai as we were pleased by it the last time, I ordered the Calamari and my roommate ordered a California Roll.  We were disappointed again.  The soup was slightly warm at best and my Calamari for $6.75 looked like 5 medium/large sized onion rings! DON'T BUY THE CALAMARI HERE!  It was overcooked and hard.  The California Roll though was the ONLY redeeming and well made item so far. 
   What happened next was so surprising I still can't believe anyone in the restaurant can be this rude!  The bartender came up to me and said, ""I can take that away now.""  I had no idea what she was talking about.  I dipped my last Calamari in the sweet sauce moved it over to my plate and she took the plate away!  RUDE!  She could not wait a minute before I finished!  what if I wanted to dip again! Nope, she already had her hand on the tray and took it.  One thing I would also like to point out that is disturbing and disgusting is that the dirty dish cart/tray is right in the dining room so we got to see all the dishes ten feet away because these employees must be too lazy and careless to take them to the back kitchen.  They must hate dishes too because that bartender/server THREW, not placed, THREW those dishes in that cart making terribly loud noises anytime she had a dish to discard and return to bar and play with her phone along with the hostess as well.  They were constantly on their phones.  UNPROFESSIONAL!  
   The bartender later came up to us after the California Roll and said, ""Are you guys expecting more food?""  WHAT?!?! ""Yes! Our Pad Thai!""  She went to retrieve our food, came back and actually handed the tray to my roommate for her to set down!! WOW! RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL!!
 The Pad Thai portion was also smaller this time, soggy and just disappointing.  Plus they overcharged my Pad Thai by $1. I ordered Steak Pad Thai for $9.50, I was charged Beef Pad Thai for $10.50 on the receipt. Throwing dishes, on their phones, eating behind the bar, watching TV and probably NO ONE there over the age of 25!

I think I've said this in other reviews involving dessert type stuff, but I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to sweets. Also, I'm more of an ice cream & cookie person (opposed to cakes or pies) so The Baked Bear is right up my alley. 

There's a good amount of cookies & ice creams to choose from (actually, I would say there's quite a bit of cookie options). They also do brownies & donuts (and you can combine if that tickles your fancy).

I wanted to guarantee I had a safe combo that went together so I went w/a salted caramel sugar cookie (which was the cookie of the month) & salted caramel ice cream. I had it warmed up. Surprisingly, the cookie warmed up perfectly & the ice cream only slightly softened and didn't melt. They cookies aren't huge, but decent enough size and I thought tasted really good (it's hard to say how fresh they were since they were warmed up). I also thought the ice cream was tasty and they use a good amount of it.

When I went to pick up the pizza it wasn't ready yet so I had a chance to chit chat with one of the employees. They are very proud of the pizza here. I was told they use 100% mozzarella cheese, fresh (never canned) ingredients, crust that is made from scratch daily, and the pizzas are cooked in brick ovens. Aside from pizza they also offer calzones, burgers, subs, chicken fingers & wings, gyros, pasta, ribs, salads, sandwiches, and appetizers. 

They have pizzas in sizes 12"" (meduim), 16"" (large), 20"" (giant), and 28"" (colossal) inch. I like the variety of sizes and the 28"" sounds interesting! I just decided to order a 20 inch ""Pepperoni Pizza"" that ended up costing a total of $18.37 with tax. The pizza wasn't bad. I liked the flavor of the sauce and amount of cheese. I don't know if they use garlic in the sauce or crust, but I tasted a distinct garlic flavor that I liked. The 20 incher was to big for me and hubby, so I had leftovers to take in my lunch to work the next day. I found the price of the pizza to be flat out ridiculous! Sure it tasted good, and I would eat it again, but not without some sort of really good coupon.

I was given a menu with my pizza and discovered they have a variety of specials. If you are just wanting pizza then they have a walk-in special for the 12"", 16"", and 20"" inch sizes, but I still didn't find it a fair price at all. They have different specials if you are ordering more then one pizza, or want to mix it up and have maybe pizza and pasta. You can also just stop in for lunch and order pizza by the slice. From 11 am - 3 pm they have a different daily special. The ""Daily Special"" is priced at $6.99 and comes with a soda. These prices don't sound bad for what you get. Here are the current daily specials:

*Monday - any pasta with garlic bread
*Tuesday - any salad with garlic bread
*Wednesday - lamb or chicken gyro with fries

*Friday - meatball sub or chicken parm sub with fries

The sales guy walked with me until I made my decision and was pretty tolerant of my two young children who were cranky. I got a free 32 inch TV and next day delivery. We talked numbers and was presented with different scenarios on how log it would take to pay. The manager also sat down with me and explained the interest rates after the 0% financing finishes. I liked the way I was treated and I received my items the very next day with no hassle. I would do business with them again.,2015-09-08 00:22:10

I live just a few minutes away from this place and I used to come here late at night for the happy hour 50% off sushi.  Since they started the all you can eat, I have now used up my first full stamp card (11 visits) and this place has consistently gotten worse since May.  I will give credit to the servers, they are nice (a little overbearing at times only because the place isn't very busy and they usually have nothing to do) I always sit at the counter too.  A few weeks ago I went in at dinner time, placed my order and received part of it, and I was waiting for the rest.  No sushi chef around he was busy talking and leaning against the back counter , another chef came up to me and asked how things were and I said ""I""m STILL WAITING, you're very slow tonight!""  he said yea it is (thinking I was talking about that business is slow), he then walked away and went back to talking to the 1st chef that had made only half my order.  A 3RD sushi chef came over and asked how I was and I said again ""I""M STILL WAITING ON MY ORDER! and literally told him what I'm waiting on. I said I've been sitting here waiting for him and pointed to the other chef to finish my order.""  He apologized and made the rest of my order for me.   This was not the first time this has occured either.  They have a female sushi chef and she often leaves her station and walks around and I have to sit and wait to place my additional orders almost 10 min wait in between before she even comes back to the counter and the other chefs look at me while I'm waiving my paper at them and they don't even stop their conversation.   I often order hand rolls and on 3 different visits they accidently made me a cut roll instead.  I even said to them what is the problem? I circled it on the paper and she said yea he gets confused because most people don't order hand rolls.  So my last 3 visits I circled hand rolls and literally scratched out cut roll so they didn't make a mistake when reading my paper.  

How about quality of food - 
Good - 
Scallop Roll
Spicy Tuna 
Spicy Salmon

That's really about it. Their sauces including eel sauce is thin, flavorless and nasty. Their is nothing yummy about their yum yum sauce. Their quality of eel isn't all that good, their yellowtail is horrible compared to other places.  

What disappoints me is they never used to be this way.  They have steadily gone down hill since May.  and it definitely shows in their business. I have seen less and less people in there each time I go.   I have gone at dinner time around 6, or 7 pm and I have been there at times around 8 or 10 pm and more often then not, I am 1 of only 3-4 people at the counter and only 3-4 tables of people eating in the dining room.  

Thanks but I'll stick to sushi mon, hikari sushi and even better yet the new sushi goyemon (they are FANTASTIC) Goyemon has very nice service, GREAT sushi chefs and their rolls and appetizers are are incredible. They have appetizers that you won't find anywhere else unless u were eating at a 5 star sushi restaurant on the strip. and their all you can eat price is the same as anyone else's $27.95 and the place is ALWAYS packed.

Sorry Lahaina but you're yet another victim of places off my list to goto.  You aren't good enough to compete with the others here in town.

I sorta discovered this place by accident when I couldn't find any parking at Erindale Park on the weekend.  This park/art gallery/hiking/mountain biking trails, etc. is literally just north of Erindale Park, north of Burnhamthorpe Rd.

Apparently, the entire property was a private residence that was donated when the owner died.  This info is probably on their website which I have not read.

Since I haven't read the website, there is a bit of mystery as to what exactly goes on in the buildings located on the property.  However, I have heard that they host art classes (paid) in one, and there is an art gallery in the main building.

Even as a lifelong Mississauga resident, I have never been inside any of the buildings.

Food wise, it was OK.  Bavette Cacio e Pepe was my favorite dish and came closest to what I expect from  handmade pasta with great fresh ingredients.  Fettuccini e Finocchio fell short of mark, the pasta felt too thick and lack a certain chewiness.  Beef meatball didn't have the comfort flavors that I was expecting, the flavor reminded me of bbq sauce with star anise thrown it.

I can't believe I didn't discover this place before.
This place is unreal with their flavors I stood there for a good 20 minutes just deciding.  I've heard in the summer this place is packed with a line up out the door.  Also in the summer they have all the freezers working with the variety of flavors, the winter though I hear they only have 1-2 freezers available. 

So I would recommend the Medium size cup which I think was about $6 and you can get up to 3 flavors to choose.

I went for Wild Rose (which tasted like a rose literally) ...Hazelnut which was really nice and creamy,,,,and Chocolate Mint (which I didnt like)
Im usually a fan of mint but this flavour tasted like a Polar Bear shot (for those drinkers out there you know what Im talking about).
It just tasted like an alcoholic shot.  So next time I would pass on that and try maybe the fruit flavours.

I have to say the flavours DO taste like what they say.  And they have a lot of choices.

The other favorite is the grilled whole squid. The dipping sauce is a spicy aioli which is cool and sharp. 
The garlic noodles are also good but I would always say remind them more al dente as sometimes it is too mushy for my taste. 
I know a lot of other reviewers like the pork belly buns but I didn't like the sauce and would pass. I am more of a purist where I don't like sauce but that is personal preference.

Today, on our honeymoon in Vegas there was no bone broth. Instead we settled for the oxtail pho with no noodles.

JUMP is located conveniently (for me at least) in the heart of the Financial District, with entrances just off of Wellington and Bay or through the commerce court courtyard (where the Running Room used to be).

The summerlicious lunch menu was $20 for 3 courses, and in my opinion had the most interesting and appealing options out of the neighbouring restaurants that also participate in this annual event. 

Since I've never been to this restaurant before I cannot comment on whether or not the renovations that took place were an improvement on its appearance. On first impression, I did find the decor very modern, spacious, and clean. I also found the dress code to be business casual although I don't think they will stop you at the door if you are wearing jeans.

Often times at summerlicious events I experience long wait periods in terms of service but I was pleasantly surprised that everything went smoothly and our courses were served within a reasonable time.

Appetizer:
Tomato Tarte
(Clover Roads tomatoes, fresh ricotta and Rosewoods Estate organic honey)
Fresh and tasty. I loved the bread as well as the tomatoes! Be careful though as there are some slivers of hot peppers in this dish so expect a bit of a spice kick!

Main:
Crab BLT
(brioche, bacon, crab, vegetable chips)
I don't think the veggie chips  served on the side were house made. Most likely they were store bought (I could be wrong) which is fine as they were still delicious. The crab BLT was humongous! Very filling for lunch and also very tasty. Love the combination of crab and oh so crispy bacon. Overall, a great sandwich and will likely go back again just for this main alone.

Dessert:
Cannoli
(pistachio and lemon curd)
Also a very large portion. Tasted fresh although they could have toned down the lemon curd to balance out all the flavours.

Overall, I think you are getting your money's worth for the quality of food they serve (in terms of summerlicious menu). The portions are also a decent size for a lunch meal.

We absolutely love it. In general, the Hotel is pricey, but worth it. It can accommodate weddings and other special events. Check-out time is 12:00pm, rather than the standard 11:00am... a nice bonus.  What's more, if you'd like to enjoy the room a little longer, call the reception and ask if you can stay an extra hour. They will probably tell you okay. (It might help if you tell them you're running late or not feeling well, etc.)

My hub and I are bilingual so we do not have any issue with language, but I will admit that the staff do tend to lean more towards their NATIVE language, le Francais, but honestly - it is not only the Manior that is like this - almost all of St. Sauveur is like this. 

We always purchase a deal that includes the buffet breakfast in the Hotel's very own Resto ""L'Ambiance"". Without the ""Forfait"" the buffet is $25.00 per person, but again it is WORTH IT. The buffet breakfast is totally awesome. We have also been there for dinner and the dinner's are very high quality too, but I don't find quite as worth the money as the breakfast. The dinners are Fine French Cuisine so the portions are super small. 

During our second visit, there was a problem with the hot water faucet in the Jacuzzi tub. Within 30 minutes a maintenance man was at our door ready to fix it. He fixed it pretty quick and we had no other problems after that.

They have all of your normal breakfast fare, from omelets to bloody marys (if you can still stand the thought of alcohol). The food here is actually better than I thought a sports bar would have, I think you'll be surprised like I was. There really isn't anything like a big, hardy, greasy breakfast to get your day going after a long night out in the big city.

The atmosphere is nice as well, as they have plenty of tvs throughout the place for great viewing of any sporting event going on.

I can see this place as a great hangout spot during a relaxing evening outside of the uptown bars & restaurants.

My friend couldn't even taste it. Pretty bummed with how this turned out. It was definitely rich, but lacking flavor. The best part about this was the bread it came with...
Fiscalini Bandaged Cheddar (cow's milk served with served with honeycomb) - This was super delicious. First time having honeycomb and didn't know what to expect. It was super sweet and delicate and was perfectly complimented with the cheese. Recommend!
Truite Amandine (pan-roasted Idaho trout with haricots verts, toasted almonds & beurre noisette) - $28.50 Saw this dish on the travel channel with Anthony Bourdaine and was super excited to try it. Presentation was beautiful and the trout was cooked perfectly.
My friend ordered the lamb, which is said wasn't very good... he was expecting so much more for the price he was paying. Can't really comment on that since I didn't try it! He's not very picky...

Located in party zone central (at least during stampede), this is the bastion of rest, relaxation and recharging for everyone from business execs to rock-stars. The rooms are dark and sexy, guaranteed to bring out your inner sex kitten! It's easily accessible to get to downtown as well as the BMO Centre. Has two excellent restaurants located inside the hotel and another phenomenal one (Taste) right out the back door. They have a huge gym and a yoga studio on the same block, and across the street are sandwich shops, a burrito joint and Italian deli. 

The staff is incredible. Let me repeat that: The staff is incredible. Friendly, kind, helpful and you feel as though they are looking out for you through your entire trip. The room I stayed in was on the 9th floor and I couldn't hear a thing from outside the hotel nor from the other rooms. The bathroom had top notch Aveda products, which I adore! And my room had a giant walk in closet in the dressing area with vanity! The Hotel Arts really is a special place. You never know who you are going to meet in the front lobby.

I also wanted to treat Mom to a gel mani and spa pedicure for a late Mother's Day present, since she typically sleeps in on Sundays, I work, and Mom is allergic to flowers (no floral arrangements!) and doesn't go for gourmet treats.  

I tried to schedule appointments for 12 pm, but having an appointment really  means you get the next person open to see you (or that's what I was told on the phone).  Mom ended up seeing Natalie for her gel mani ($30) and express pedi ($18; I had her down for a $30 spa pedi, but Mom didn't want to do the sugar scrub), and I saw Tara for my express pedi.  They weren't kidding when they say ""express!""  Soaking time was minimum, at least for my feet.  Mom had a longer soak, since Natalie had to wrap Mom's previously gel-painted natural nails first before continuing with the express pedicure.  By the time Natalie took my Mom's feet out of her spa soak, my toasies were getting painted.  Just basic cleaning of the nails and cuticles (and I have TINY toenails!); No massage- just an application of lotion on my legs after.  Mom didn't get leg massage, either.  She did receive a massage on her hands and forearms, but much shorter time that anywhere she's gotten them.  Mom and I really like the way Natalie applied the gel polish layers perfectly- no squiggles, ridges, or bubbles, and the polish perimeters are clean, which means that when the nails grow out, there won't be any uneven, or peeling layers that tend to catch on anything- clothes, hair, etc.- or so we hope!

Nice atmosphere and nicely-decorated.  Big surprise is that the male owner of Pink Polish and the female owner of Scottsdale Nails II are brother and sister!  I think Pink Polish has nicer couches and chairs* and a more relaxing waiting area, which is in front; All of the manicuring is done at the back of the lobby and cashier area.  There's even a separate hallway/area where you go for waxing.  

Guess I'll try this place again the next time I need a gel mani and express pedi!

*Lobby chairs, a couch, and a few chairs with pads looked very nice.  The station where customers end up getting their manicures have chairs with dirty-looking pads.  I suppose it's hard to keep polish accidents from marring the chair pads, but upon first glance, these chairs do not look inviting to sit on.",2016-05-12 20:52:48

Location is fantastic - convenient for anyone and any occasion.
Menu is OK - no wow to it. Best thing there are the pretzels!
The biggest complaint I have is the almost too common, TERRIBLY SLOW service.
I recently went to AB with a group of 6 people for lunch at 130pm. Mind you, lunch rush was over. Took a little too long to get seated because we had called ahead and made a reservation - still had to wait 10 minutes. 
After being seated, it took about 15 minutes for our beverages to arrive - sparkling water and lemonade ... really?!?!!? It was even worse when we ordered our food. Everyone ordered a salad, get this, it took a full 20 minutes for the salads to arrive in a half empty restaurant. AB should take notice and fix the problem. More and more restaurants are opening up in downtown, people will have more choices and AB will have to eventually address lousy service.",2013-01-12 15:30:08

From the outside, this place doesn't really look like much. It's clean, and newish, but that's about all I could tell. Inside it's clean too, with tables as well as some couches and comfy chairs to pick for seating. It's a walk-up-and-order type of place, too, so step back to read the menu and make your selection so you don't hold up the line. There was a good group there when I went, but not enough to call it crowded- there's a large screen where some folks were watching the Spain/Italy soccer match, which seems to change based on what is playing at the time. If you're not the sports type, they also have free wifi- ask the cashier for the password. 

The menu is pretty diverse, with kabobs (hence the name) taking the majority, but some wrap sandwiches and other grilled meats, too. I love Persian and Mediterranean cuisine, and this place had a good mix of offerings from lamb, chicken, and tenderloin kabobs to chicken schwarma wrap and sides such as hummus and dolmas. 
I had the chicken schwarma wrap, BF had the lamb kabobs, and we got extra bread and hummus for the table. Other dining partners ordered slightly different variations of the same, but beef dishes. Everyone dug in and loved the food- it was hot, fresh, and flavorful, and in ample portions. The plates each had sides of a small salad or dolmas, and rice or hummus- these are probably interchangeable, but i have to say that the rice was surprisingly good! Very moist and flavorful, it perfectly complemented the lamb dishes.

ATMOSPHERE
Parked conveniently on the street in a designated meter area. I know there is a parking garage located behind the restaurant too. Walking into MTO Cafe, it is lit during the day with the natural light streaming from the floor-to-ceiling windows. Very busy, but the service and wait time was quick and friendly. The space inside is very modern chic and relaxing. Perfect for our brunch. Also, my sister LOVED the fact that her phone was dying and they had an outlet literally on the wall at our table, eye-level.

FOOD
I ordered the MTO Avocado Omelet. Portion size was fine, I wasn't starving, so the meal was great for me. Lots of avocado, and served with a tiny salad and a few fresh fruits. I also ordered the Green Juice, very very yummy! I loved how many fruits and vegetables were in there, and you could definitely taste the freshness.

SERVICE

3-hour all-you-can-bowl including shoes for $12.  Ginormous--at least 100 lanes straight across!  Fairly clean.  Large enough to accommodate multiple big groups with plenty of room to spare.  Renovated, spacious bar area with tables, darts, billiards and TVs.  11-bottle domestic beer buckets for $5 and a decent mainstream beer collection.  Well-stocked arcade for the kids, including skee ball and DDR.  

CONS: 
No air conditioning, just clunky ceiling fans (not enough to cool off a facility this big, an issue in the summer).  Super dry lanes (eek, put some oil on that).  Grimy balls (shush) paired with the dry lanes, will do unkind things to your hook. 

AMBIANCE:
The enormity of this place is impressive but also creates a perpetual half-empty ghost-town feel, even when a decent number of people are around.  Unless you come during a league event of massive proportions, you're not going to quite get that quintessential dive-y, grungy Lebowski/classic crowded bowling alley feel here.

Came with coworkers on a Friday night and it was pretty dead.  Don't know if it's because it's Wickliffe or bowling just isn't a Friday thing.  We had a waitress checking up on us regularly--she was a real sweetheart.  Some of us ordered food later on, which smelled and looked pretty good--the usual barfare: burgers, fries, etc.  The scoring displays and machines were well-maintained--we got none of the infuriating lag between keypad and display or unworkable keypads that we're used to at most alleys.  Everything ran very smoothly, except for the lanes themselves, unfortunately.  The lanes were super dry and the balls were rather grimy--I don't throw any hooks but even my straight throw kept going awry.  Bringing your own ball might make a difference.  Altogether a fun venue but I probably won't be back; it's all the way across town and there's plenty of other options, including other Freeway Lanes branches closer to me.",2011-07-12 15:18:10

Sometimes you want to go,

Where nobody knows your name, but you're always glad you came. 

You want food that is comforting, a place that's open in the morning.

You want go where prices remain the sameeeeee.

Truthfully, 'Xe Lua Restaurant' deserves a three star. The service is bland, the food is mediocre but the price is right and they are perhaps the better option for Pho compared to the many other locations along Dundas and Spadina. So, because of these last two points I have to bump them up to a four star.

For a first time experience consider ordering a small or medium Pho Special 101.

It opened a few months back and received some good reviews so hubby and I stopped by to try for ourselves. For a tiny pretzel shop they had a a nice variety of things on the menu, including vegan-friendly options. 

When it comes to pretzels they offer the following:
Plain
Garlic
Jalapeno
Cinnamon Sugar
Pepperoni
Raisin
Sesame
Sweet Almond
Honey Whole Grain
Sour Cream and Onion

Pretzel Stix and Pretzel Nuggets come either salted or in cinnamon sugar. They also have Pretzel Dogs that come in sizes mini, regular and jumbo.

Dipping Sauces:
Cheese 
Melted Cheese 
Hot Salsa Cheese
Marinara
Caramel 
Sweet Mustard
Light Cream Cheese
Sweet Glaze

I ordered a ""Sour Cream and Onion"" and ""Jalapeno"" pretzel. They were priced at $3.49 each. I also ordered 2 melted cheese dips priced at 75 cents each. The cashier was very friendly and they had samples out on the counter. One thing I did like is the cashier asked if I wanted my pretzels salted or unsalted. I don't like salt on my pretzel and some places have it already on the pretzel and I get stuck picking it off, at least here I had the option to have it with or without. The sour cream and onion pretzel was just ok. It wasn't as soft and warm like I'm used to and it could have used more of the sour cream and onion on it. The jalapeno pretzel was pretty good, but again on the dry side. They weren't stingy with the jalapenos which was nice, but it seemed like the pretzel wasn't as fresh as it could have been. The melted cheese dip wasn't melted at all. I think she gave me the regular cheese dips instead. I didn't mind the regular cheese dip however the cheese being warm would have been more to my liking.

My mom and I decided to go try our luck in selling some old stuff at the outdoor swap meet, but when we get there...it looks NOTHING like it used to.  From outside, we could see that it was a legit marketplace, there wasn't any blankets on the floor or old junk.  We asked a worker how much it would cost to sell stuff and he said it was $30 dollars on Fridays and $35 on Saturdays.  We decided not to embarrass ourselves and paid the $1.50 admission to check the place out.

This place is HUGE!  I walked around for 3 hours and still didn't get the chance to see everything.  The main shops are womens fashion clothing, pistachios-nuts-fruits, shoes, pets (quails, chickens, roosters, birds, and bunnies), and undergarments.

Everything is fairly cheap, we got 2 lbs of boiled peanuts for $5 and two well knitted hats for $10.  

They also have plenty of food options.  I had a Taco de Pastor from Taco Tijuana for $2.  It was pretty good, but a little oily for me.  If you're new like me, then be sure to pay first and give the receipt to the guys at the meat station after.  I wasted some time waiting at the meat station since I thought it was the opposite.  And be sure to stop by the Krazy Corn for an elote!  It's corn smothered in mayo, cotija cheese, chili powder, and butter.  

It probably isn't the best place to try and sell old stuff anymore, I saw a shop selling used clothes for $1.  But it is definitely a place to check out if you ever want to experience something different from the usual swap meet. 

Tip:  If you ever find yourself in the middle of the swap meet, there is a stage and when I went there was a mariachi band playing.  It seems like they have different events held there every week.",2014-02-11 05:18:19

First the crab cakes they were two about 2oz ea.. it was on an asian cole slaw which sat in a pool of sweet chile sauce and olive oil.
          The slaw was good but the sweet chile sauce was way too sweet, the crab cakes were meaty not to much filler and were good.
        The big island goat cheese with mac nuts and a sweet soy sauce glaze was pretty good but did not care for the island bread that came with it , more like a cracker.
          We both ordered the cuban sandwich it came with fried yucca. The sandwich was very good . It was pressed nicely so it had a nice crispness to it. The ham and roast pork was a decent amount. Everything was nicely balanced. The fried yucca was intresting it had a crisp crust and a creamy texture in the middle not much flavor like a potato. I kinda got used to it ,wife did not like it.  Service was very good. I took a star away for pricing and a small menu.  I think bahama breeze is a better deal and they have  a very diverse menu,if your looking for carribbean flavor.",2011-02-28 00:28:02

It's one of those restaurants that feel like a secret. I know I've seen it before, but it's so easy to overlook and pass by because of it's location on the end of the Plaza. I have for years now even though we frequently in the area...just has been passed up for its more easily seen neighborhoods. Shame, wish I came in sooner! 

Ordered up Pork Pad Se Ew, Pork Larb, Chicken Panang, and Beef Mongolian. 

Mom and Gma never had Pad Se Ew, but loved it here. It was indeedy delicious and the Chinese broccoli was particularly fresh and had a great snap on them. 

Scotts ""thing"" when coming to new Thai restaurants is ordering panang. It's a dish he feels helps judge the place as it's one of the most popular yet flavor complex dishes. Thai Noodles definitely passed his approval. It was well balanced curry base and the chicken was soft and juicy. I didn't think ma and gma would like as much as they did but it was their favorite dish of the evening. Even for a mild- it had a bit of spice to it, but not anything that will kill ya. 

A staple of mine is pork larb. I just love lime and chili based salads and theirs was yummy. I like the ground pork was still slightly bigger pieces...some places it's such a tiny grind that it get's a bit dry and ""sandy"" in a way. Everyone thought it was good, but again I think I was being selfish ordering this since I'm the only one who loves sour flavors. WIll be ordering this again- I practically ate this solo, but partly since I was hoarding. 

Now the disappointment was grandmas request- the Mongolian Beef. Firstly she was thinking this was like Chinese stirred with a thicker darker sauce, onions, leeks. This was in a lighter, I think mushroom based sauce and had carrots, peppers and straw mushrooms. It would have been alright, but the beef was a bit tough....maybe skip the beef next time?

Prices are great, food comes out piping hot. Definitely some of their seafood dishes intrigued me so I will save those for another day since the in laws have this strong aversion to seafood and gets all weird even if we eat it. I saw they had on a specials board a green curry paste fried rice that sounds delicious and I'd love me some three companion (chicken, papaya salad, sticky rice) and beef jerky for the next time. 

Between this spot and Mix Zone Cafe, hard to decide a favorite contender, but they are both definitely on the short list as some of the best Thai curry I have had in Vegas. 

Will be back, soon I hope. :-)",2010-05-30 04:58:16

The service has been 10/10 each time I come eat here and so is the music! Haha. The interior is quite nice too, I mean it's perfect to eat and talk stories with your friends, the ambience is just dark and loud music. 
Now the food, I ordered a hachi salad and it was made with rice crackers and that was pretty delicious if you ask me, a little too saucy for a salad but it was still good.
I also ordered hamaguri clams, 2.50 for a clam. They were a little hard/chewy and the sauce for the clam was a little salty. 
All the other stuff I ordered was up to par though! Like the salmon sashimi, the salmon rolls, sukiyaki ($15 for a bowl good for up to 2 people) chicken skewers, and the desserts. The oysters are okay not the best I've ever had. But if I had to really recommend anything my absolute favorites to order is the sukiyaki, the fish, and all the cheap little tapas. surprising they fill you up! That's probably my favorite thing about this restaurant, all the tapas are very good priced and the quality is pretty on point too with most of the stuff and the variety of stuff to choose from, but all still in the Japanese category. Oh and I would definitely recommend dessert, the matcha panna cotta is my absolute fav!! It has little red beans at the bottom and the honey toast is a little sweet and really honey but it's good for a group of friends and it's HUGE. My overall experience was 5 stars",2016-04-19 12:31:44

The 20% check in discount was ok. Honestly I won't  be back here again even if they offer me money. 

The sushi rice was wrong. Way too soft and the ratio of fish and rice was all about rice. Not great. The garlic tuna was like yucky. I almost barf  Tuna tasted like it's the cheapest quality and had been seating there for a month or so. The same with the sashimi salad.

After spending most of the day shopping, it was late in the afternoon, but we still headed out to Red Rock.  Me and the little one were a bit tired and truthfully, I could care less if we saw Red Rock or not, but my mister was determined to see it.  I searched for the location on my mister's iPhone.  After about driving 20 or 30 minutes toward Summerlin, we got to what I thought was our destination...Red Rock Casino and Resort.  My mister explained that he was looking for the state park.  How was I suppose to know?  So, I searched on the iPhone again and found the correct directions, but it looked like it might be closed already since it was 4PM.  Not ready to give up, my mister wanted to pass by, just so we'll know where to go next time.  

We arrived at the gate, and low and behold, they were still open.  Since it's spring and the day is longer, the park doesn't close until 7pm.  We paid the $7 entrance fee and my mister was happy as a clam and was proud of himself for his persistence and not listening to me.  After driving toward the Red Rock, I was glad that my mister didn't give up so fast.  The scenery was BEAUTIFUL!  It was so surreal.  I didn't realize there are trails that go through the park. It's very peaceful and it makes you just appreciate nature.  We took the 13 mi scenic drive and stopped at the vista spots to take pictures.  We had to be quick because the sun was going down fast.

I like sandwiches. I hadn't really found a great sandwich place to go to- sometimes Melt is just so greasy, and nothing seems to compete with Zingermans where I spent many years.

After hearing so many good reviews from fellow yelpers, we went to Bogtrotters Doorstep tonight. Oh man, was it ever good.

First, it's kind of hard to find. ""1848 W. 25th"". Ummm. For the illiterate directionalist I am, I was rather confused when the address led me to Old Angle Tavern. I walked in and out a couple of times.... then called them. ""There's tables right outside my door"" said the voice on the other line (although he almost seemed annoyed), ""you mean the door with the dentists names outside?"" ""No, there's tables right outside""..and then I realized it was on Bridge instead. Oops.

Walked in, found my dinner partner waiting, and Nate greeted me with a smile (ok, may he wasn't annoyed). It's a cute hole in the wall place, right off of Old Angle- in fact, it shares a spot with Old Angle, so we were able to bring our food into Old Angle, enjoy the live music there, and eat our sandwiches.

Nate actually brought us our sandwiches as we sat in Old Angle (aww, how nice!). We both ordered ours ""wet"" and ""crunchy""- meaning, that the sandwich is dipped in au jus sauce and ""crunchy"" meaning that they put chips on it. Simple enough. He got the porkopolis- pork loin was good, and Nate even went the extra mile and put fresh greens on it (he said there was broccoli!)- just to be nice. Wow. He got an extra star in my book for that. I thought it was a tad salty though- but I guess all pork loins are salty.

My sandwich was GREATTTTTT. I got the Philly- roast beef, cheese sauce, onions, mushrooms, dipped in au jus.... omg, that was a GREAT GREAT sandwich. And yes, get it crunchy- the chips make it so good... it definitely reminded me of the cheesesteaks in Philly, where I just needed to order ""steak with wiz!"" Omg. YUM YUM YUM.

I'll be back to bogtrotters. It's a HUGE sandwich, so it's definitely worth it. Mmmm. Go go go. It's not the greasy sandwiches you'll find at other places- this is a sandwich with solid meat, and solid toppings, and it's served with great service. I approve. Nom nom x 10.",2011-12-10 03:28:09

I ended up getting there Grape leaves wrapped over meat dish and opted for rice instead of noodles. It was decent for the price.

Ok so the only thing that really bothered me about this place was there cleanliness. I think having a clean restaurant makes the food easier to swallow. I had a really hard time doing that as I look around while eating.

Almost like they were keeping them for themselves to eat later. Ebi was super fresh & sweet. Only downfall was the service was a bit slow. We had a reservation for 10 ppl & it seemed they weren't prepared for that even though they knew the # of ppl we had coming in as we had confirmed it. Location of venue a bit hard to find (it's on the far right side of Target). I could have ate till I popped but I would leave that for another time. I cannot wait to go back.,2013-09-17 19:54:23

They served Champagne until 3, they offered Prime Rib, peel and eat shrimp and Seafood Pasta.  I can never understand why people start on the salad bar with food like this!

This buffet is the best thing this side of Vegas.  Even including many of the buffets in Vegas I've had.  The food was very fresh and tasty, the service was okay, coffee strong and really quite nice!  There was an awesome selection of food and yum.

I am still pissed off 3 days later.  Funny thing is they didn't do anything wrong in particular - I just get pissed spending money on crappy food!

The menu had Limited menu choices - in other words the top ten Americanized Chinese dishes and that is it.

I ordered a garlic chicken.  Deep fried chicken nuggets in a sweet sauce with garlic.  Way to sweet, nothing savory in this dish, no balance, and the garlic didn't go with the sauce.  It was just a mess.

The menu prices were $12-$15 for less than average common Chinese food.  The teryaki chicken at my kids junior high tastes better!  The bill for 2 people was $37.  Not expensive , but for what you get it sucks!

What really rubbed my rhubarb the wrong way is there is a Panda Express in the food court.  The food at Panda Express is better (I do not say this lightly)!  We could have went to Panda and spent about $15 for 2 people and ate better!!

(mostly because I had gone to a competitor 10 years prior which left me with a bowl cut. It was so bad that I vowed never to get a cheap hair cut again). Fortunately, the ladies at Great Clips put me at ease. Mind you that they don't do any of the crazy styles I've had in the past and they don't do color either, but what they do - basic haircuts at a killer price - they do well. So far, it seems that they hire people who actually know what they are doing and many of them have years and years of experience. the normal price is around $12 bucks.

This Anthem spot isn't for the sushi purist, but rather the sushi lover that takes quality more seriously than the dish's name.  

Japanese Lasagna, Tastes like my ex-wife, and Screaming orgasm are all rolls featured on the menu at I Love Sushi.  I've never had a bad bite of anything here.  My only complaint about the food, is that many of the rolls are bathed in sauce.  For me, this is a no-no.  A little sauce is alright, but drowning something in spicy mayo only aims to hide poor quality ingredients, and the quality here is superb.

Even when this place gets jumping, and it does, the service is outstanding.  Food arrives in a timely manner, and is at the right temperature.  

The Sushi Bomb here is out of this world, and definitely my favorite thing on the menu.  It is simple and satisfying.   It is tuna or salmon sashimi served with fresh wasabi.  This is HOT HOT HOT.  Stuffy sinuses seak shelter from this inferno of tasty heat.

Muramoto is a small, intimate restaurant with really cool Japanese hipster vibe much like Morris Ramen next door. I don't get a weeaboo vibe from them, so don't start getting all ""oishii gocheesosama deshda arigato gozaimasu"" when you're there. At 8 pm on a Saturday, it was actually fairly quiet. The place was only half full, and they managed to block the noise from the loud pride festival outside. The menu has some interesting, fairly-priced hot items, but I came for the sushi. Each sushi item had a very appetizing description talking about the origin, preparation, and flavor of the ingredient. It was difficult to not just order everything.

I started a large sushi combo plate for $25. That may sound like a lot of money for a roll and 9 pieces of nigiri, but it's actually an awesome deal considering how generous they are with their fish portions. Mine came with an octopus and scallion roll, bonito, albacore, blue fin (at mid-fattiness or chutoro), escarol, scallop, sweet raw shrimp, smoked salmon, yellowtail, and chilean sea bass. I'm not going to describe it all in detail since that would take forever, but it was all awesome. Everything was so flavorful and intentional. I was at a place owned by one of Jiro's trainees a few weeks ago, and this was pretty much just as good. I got some more of my favorite nigiri and sashimi pieces afterwards. My favorite was probably the uni (sea urchin). If you're an adventerous sea food eater and have never tried uni, the sweet, creamy, fishy flavor will make you fall in love with sushi all over again.

My only complaint was the rice. It wasn't warm and was kind of mushy and pasty. It didn't ruin the roll, but I found myself eating around it when eating nigiri. I will probably order most things as sashimi from now on.

When I got my bill, I was pleasantly surprised by how little it cost. I had a world-class sushi feast for 2 people for under $80 after tipping generously. I will be back soon.",2017-08-20 03:21:21

Last night I went with a group of friends, we had a party of 8 and we got put into the front corner by the bar... maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it as much? My chair cushion was all cracked and it kept scratching my legs, it was kind of painful but it seemed that everyone at my table had the same problem with their chair so I couldn't ask to switch. Our seating placement sadly also made it very difficult to view the performers as the stage was right behind me, and even from the other side of the table the speakers and a pillar blocked the view of my friends.

Regardless our waitress and the manager would do their best to make sure we got what we want, we asked for the roasted pineapple and deep fried banana a LOT. They were honestly trying their best, we just got put in an inconvenient spot for anything except refilling our water. 
The food pasta and salad bar was delicious as always! I just wish I could've found the ketchup. Some of the meats they brought out were very dry - I really DO NOT like the Chicken Parmesan, that's my preference... and my entire table, haha. The top sirloin was fantastic, signature steak was pretty good, cheesy prime rib was super juicy... beyond that I can't remember the name for most things. I'm surprised that some of the servers really didn't know how to cut their meat to request? My boyfriend asked for a good, fatty piece and the server gave him the first piece he could cut which was a really dry, small piece that was kind of just hard... unless the server didn't hear him? I don't know.
The only time I would come to this place is summerlicious, it's way to expensive otherwise... it's still really expensive during summerlicious.

So you don't get bored, they actually change the course every few weeks as well.  It is fun and pretty safe since they suit you up and give you a legit helmet to wear while racing. 

My reason for giving Pole Position 3 stars would be the price. When we went it was $25 a race. I thought that was high for one race with about 10 laps. I have seen Pole Position on Groupon, but the rates were still on the high side for me. 

It is fun to ride these fast karts and we will probably go every now and then,  but not often unless the price goes down a bit or a good Groupon comes along.",2013-04-22 15:18:32

From the menu that night, I ordered:

House-made baguette and gougères: I'm not very used to paying for bread, but these were pretty nice. The center was very light and airy. I personally liked the baguette more, and it was delicious with the accompanying chive butter.

Local burrata cheese with roasted grapes and toasted bread: I really enjoyed the toasted bread with the touch of extra virgin olive oil. The roasted grapes were delightful and provided a sweet counterbalance to the cheese and bread. However, the biggest problem that I had was that the creamy cheese was exceedingly rich and it was hard to eat too much of it on its own.

Summer squash arancini with Telaggio cheese, served with a tomato sauce: Again, there was too much cheese for me. Normally, I would never complain about too much cheese, but the combination of the risotto, squash and cheese made this deep fried concoction overly heavy, particularly after the previous burrata course. At this point, I really wished I had ordered a lighter salad of some sort. 

House-made Spaghetti with Bottarga: the spaghetti was cooked al dente and had a real bite to it, which suited my preferences quite perfectly. The sauce had bright, wonderful flavours. This was my favourite dish of the night.

I love Italian food, so I really wanted to like this place. I thought the spaghetti was really delicious. However, on the balance, I really can't say that I enjoyed the menu of the night.

This dessert shop is located inside the Dragon City Mall right at the corner of Spadina x Dundas, but it has its own entrance from Dundas. 

Very busy on a Saturday night when we went, and they were busy fulfilling Ritual orders as well.

We ordered the mango shaved ice ($7.99) and chocolate parfait ($5.99).
Presentation-wise, 10/10. Looks amazing.
There was just one girl manning the floor and she was running back and forth. They gave me the wrong parfait and I heard that it was given to another table ""on the house"", and I had to wait even longer for mine. My boyfriend was already done with his mango shaved ice when mine finally arrived--not sure why it took so long even without the mistake. But the chocolate parfait was delicious. It had banana, pocky (albeit broken), chocolate and vanilla ice cream, corn flakes, whipped cream and these interesting jelly pieces which tasted like mocha. The mango shaved ice came in a huge stone bowl with milk and syrup on the side. My boyfriend was not too fond of the mango which was too hard (very unripe)...they did come out of a can after all. The syrup was rich and delicious, and the shaved ice was good. I suppose it could've been more saturated with flavour.

Overall it is a nice late-night dessert shop to hit up if you are in the area. Good Asian desserts .",2016-12-25 19:53:36

We decided to go with the Assorted pites - A sample of all their pites: Spanakopita, one Tirokafteropita and one Pantzaropita ($8.95). 
- Spanakopita (spinach pie): the filling was just too salty for my liking
- Tirokafteropita (feta cheese, hot peppers and yogurt): Didn't really taste much of the hot peppers, overall just an okay pite
- Pantzaropita (beets, leeks): the filling was so flavourful and delicious. easily my favourite one (although i'm not sure that's saying very much)

Our next dish was the Grilled Kalamari - Fresh grilled kalamari, dressed with a balsamic vinegrette and topped with fresh onions ($13.95). It was grilled nicely and wasn't too chewy. The balsamic vinegrette was also nice. This was a decent dish.

Since we had ordered two starters, we decided to share the Pork Souvlaki Dinner - Served with salad, roast potatoes, and rice ($16.95).

Sushi house is located on Main St. in Brampton at the North end of the strip. It features a variety of Japanese and Korean dishes with a nice sushi bar and a number of booths and tables. The booths being just wood are not that comfortable, but they are private.

The restaurant features a nice sushi bar at the front with what appears to be actual Japanese itamae (chefs). Dressed in crisp white uniforms and hats, the chefs set the mood for what you will perceive to be an authentic Japanese meal.

There is a variety of dishes and the nigiri sushi and maki rolls are the perfect size. The rice on this occasion seemed a bit ""al dente"" but the fish was fresh and lean. The Nabe-yaki Udon was very good but once again the noodles seemed to be a little undercooked.....either that or they expected one to eat it a bit slower so the cooking would catch up.

I would imagine the booths near the window to be a bit uncomfortable on cold days and a table on the side might be better. Of course the sushi bar would also be a great place to sit. The service is good with a main waitress and another one to back her up. Judging by the ""help wanted"" sign on the window, they may be a bit down on staff. However the food came out around the expected time.",2016-01-11 17:36:16

In fact I was completely opposed to going here and was on my way to another establishment, but I was semi-forced to go here by the group I was with.  Big mistake on both fronts, especially since I already saw the yelp reviews...

Overpriced, even for Vegas.  Most dishes were in the $18-$20 range and were nothing special.  My chicken mushroom noodles were actually decent noodles, but everything else was bland and sort of greasy.  How do they have all that grease/oil and not much flavor?

The service was decent, but not great (I realize sometimes you are paying for service at places like this, but the service wasn't very good, not rude or dismissive or anything like that, just not great).

The interior is pretty nice I guess, so at least there is something to look at.  I tried another dish and it was also bad.  It was really fishy and even the shrimp wasn't good.  It was some seafood wonton soup.  The wontons were pretty good, but the rest of the dish including the noodles and the brother were yuck!

I will never return, but I will return to Cesars in Las Vegas.  Even if I am with a group who wants to go here, I will make up an excuse to go gamble and not attend.

I don't mean for this review to be hateful in any way.  I just don't think this restaurant tries very hard and there is no excuse for the prices being so high.

My soup/salad was pretty good.  I was pleased.  My roommate was less than thrilled with her choice.  I asked her to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being amazing and 1 being awful.  She gave the jumbalaya a 2.5.  Needless to say, we skipped dessert and signed our check an hour and a half after being seated.

Brunch at Bouchon. Saturday, 1:15 pm, there was hardly a wait. We shared: 

-- chicken & waffles ($25): fancier & pricier, but in terms of taste, does not hold a candle to my beloved Roscoe's (yes, I said it & I'm not ashamed!) The two components tasted like two separate dishes on one plate. The roasted chicken was delicious w/ the gravy & the bacon-chive waffle was good w/ the maple syrup, but put it all together & it was just a hot mess; it didn't belong together. I didn't know if I was eating breakfast or dinner. I did not dig TK's version of chicken & waffles. 
-- corned beef hash ($18): i like how they used cubes of corned beef instead of shredded corned beef; it matched the size & shape of the potatoes. A little greasy, but very flavorful & hearty. Topped with an egg (I chose soft scrambled.)
-- tartine au thon ($17, tuna): open-face sandwich, tuna was very lemony. I'm not a tuna fan, but my taste buds agreed with this dish. Fries were crispy & well salted.

Foodies (I don't consider myself to be one) put Bouchon & Thomas Keller on a pedestal, but honestly, I've had much better brunch food elsewhere.",2011-01-27 20:34:14

Brew Tea Bar has become one of my go-to spots for when I'm craving some boba. It's close to my house and serves my favorite milk tea flavor, rose. The rose milk tea is phenomenal and definitely tastes even better with their honey boba. 

A specialty that Brew Tea Bar serves is the milk tea latte: a tea of your choice as the base infused with sea salt creamer. It might sound a whole lot of weirdness at first, but give it a try! I personally loved the black tea latte. I've also tried their passion fruit green tea with less sugar and Hokkaido milk tea which were both good. 

They ensure that you are satisfied with your drink before you leave their place, or they will gladly replace you with another drink. They also allow you to select your sugar level and provide great recommendations whenever you're stuck on what to order.

You need a player card which is free when you sign up for it.

My recent visit here I brought about 9 people with me and we all ordered steak and eggs! So for under 50 bucks paid for all 10 of us! Not bad!

The 3 stars are mainly for their cheap specials. With that said, the negatives you gotta deal with are: You gotta walk through the smoke filled casino to get to the restaurant. Arizona Charlie's is one of the older casinos, which means the ventilation is not very good. So if you're hanging out there for a bit, you go home smelling like an ashtray. Service is decent in most cases but when you do get bad service, it's the whole shabang. Some of the servers that work there hate what they are doing and sadly it reflects how they treat you servicewise. Also sometimes you get a chef that don't know the difference between medium rare and well done. I would say about 75 percent of the time they get it right. The other 25 percent I don't dare complain cuz they might end up doing something else to my steak if you know what I mean. For 3.99 you can't really complain.

I wasn't a very frequent customer, but whenever I craved something cold and wasn't in the mood for a smoothie, I would come down here and buy a drink. 

I don't know if it was because I always ordered the wrong things, but every boba I've tasted before was just average, common like every other boba flavor out there. I guess you can say that I didn't understand the hype about the place. 

Then I found out you can customize drinks. Haha silly me for not knowing that. The real beauty of this boba store isn't the drinks on the menu, but the flexibility they have to customize those drinks into something really, really special. 

Based off of my friend's recommendation to give Brew Tea another shot, I ordered the Hokkaido Milk Tea w/ sea salt. At first sip, I was just blow away. So tasty! It leaves sweet and slightly salty flavor in your mouth that keeps the drink from becoming boring. You can practically drink the whole thing and be unsatisfied due to the sole fact that you just want to drink even MORE.

Make sure you don't stuff yourself silly and save some room for the fried rice towards the end of BBQ'ing your meats. I seriously save some of my grilled meat/ kimchi/ soybean spouts and wait to enjoy them with the fried rice. That is the best and only reason that makes honey pig a step above the rest of their competitors. The fried rice costs an extra $2.95 per person, but it's worth it! My boyfriend and I just ordered one portion and it was more than enough for the two of us to share.

This location offers exactly the same dining experience as the California locations. The service here is amazing (and that's saying a lot for this type of dining), the prices are competitive, the meats are a step above most AYCE Korean BBQ places and not to mention they are conveniently open 24 hours. 

We did the AYCE dinner which is $25 per person. The only limitation we encountered - you can only order 1 order (1 rib) of kalbi (marinated short rib) per person. The kalbi meat was moist, slightly on the fatty side, but tasty and well marinated. 

If all else fails, order the pork belly! We were extremely impressed with the quality of the pork belly here, I mean c'mon, this place is called honey pig; the pig is where it's at! It was super fresh, buttery, juicy and melt-in-your-mouth good; we had to get a second (& third) round. 

We also tried the thinly sliced beef brisket (too plain and dry for my taste) and the spicy pork (seasoned well and tender) but my tastebuds wanted more grilled and glistening pork belly. It's soooo good. 

All of the banchan offered were basic, nothing overly impressive, but they were solid additions to the meal. Also, the salad that comes with the meal is pretty standard. You can request rice or radish wraps if you want to enjoy them with your grilled meats as well. 

I can't say enough amazing things about the fried rice at the end, they add seasoned rice with bits of leafy greens onto the same hot grilling pan and fry it in the meat, pork belly and grilled kimchi juices. The best way to fry your rice is to let your rice sit on the pan for a few minutes, without moving it, letting it get super crispy and charred. If you're smart, you saved a supply of some grilled meat (preferably pork belly), grilled and charred kimchi and soybean sprouts and fry the rice all together with those goodies. Before you know it - your fried rice is ready to feast on and it was soooo worth the wait!",2014-10-07 22:22:29

I've also yet to order a meal that I have not liked. Granted, I always feel tremendously full when I leave, but I can't fault the restaurant for that. It is mostly due to the delicious salsa and bean dip you get before you even order the actual meal.

WHAT: I know the name of the boutique does not serve its justice, I was pretty hesitant to walk inside myself, but why not man up and walk into something new! I actually walked inside the store yesterday, and was surprised. Well, the thing that caught my eye was the huge TOMs sign they had, since I have a TOMs shoe collection started. Lol. They have some of the newer styles in stock, so if you're a TOMs shoe lover like myself, go and check it out!

It's a small shop with different styles of clothing for men, women, and even children! The kids clothes are extremely cute! 8). My friend purchased this small sac with a baby onesie inside. The outside of the bag said something like.. ""the sex of your unborn baby is predicted upon opening this bag."" So, the point of this story is... there are random things in the store, and you may be lucky to find something for you!

Oh yeah, in addition to my TOMs story, I found some cute teal ones in my size... and they were 50% off!!! WINNER!!!

Jjajangmyeon-have it the second time here and it was good.  Has bitty  chunks of what I look for in a nice bowl of jjangmyeon, the meat and veggies.  The noodle was nice, not too chewy, not too mushy..just right.  What I like is that they have 2 sizes, the small for $4.95, and the regular for $6.95.  The small was more than enough for me.

Beef Noodle Soup-The first time I had it here, I fell in love...the beef and tendon was soooo tendor along with green healthy looking baby bok choy, in a nice succulent broth, accompanied by nicely cooked noodles.  The second time, the meat was not tender, and I wasn't too happy...The third time...which is this time...was like the first time when I fell in love with it.

They serve  you hot tea and side dishes (kim chi and daikon) with your food.

I must say that I was not impressed at all by the salad (think spring greens with olive oil and some balsamic) but the salmon was not bad. However, the star of the meal was the steak and the potato. I don't eat baked potatoes very often but theirs was extremely delicious: they empty out the potato, make a mash and season it and then fill up the skin with the mashed potato and bake it - it was super flavourful and silky. Both our steaks came a perfect medium and the portions were huge! Although, I've had better ones but for $25, I am not complaining.

Environment- this place made me feel so at home! Random & cute toys at the bar, plush vegetables sitting against the chairs, bookcases filled with manga, and Japanese curtains covering the windows that made me feel like I was in someone's home in Japan. Something about it made me feel very cozy & comfortable being there :-)

Food- Tastes like simple but delicious home-cooked meals! Fusion between Japanese and European food. I had the oyako don (about $9) which was just eggs, onions, and chicken over rice. How could something so simple taste so good? I'm not a big fan of rice, but I gobbled up my whole dish, which was rich and flavorful. Also came with a house salad and soup. Check in on Yelp and try their Yuzu soda- it's really unique! Tasted like soda w/ kumquats.. 
Unfortunately I was too full for any dessert.. but they do have a variety of green tea desserts.. and I love green tea so I'll definitely be back for those!

I can't say that this is the best sushi place that I've ever had, but this is my sushi go-to in the area. They don't take reservations at peak hours, but you can call ahead to get the approximate wait time and to put your name down on the list. They do get packed during busy hours and the wait time for food is way longer than other times - I won't ding that on the review because that is somewhat expected. (Just plan accordingly and be realistic with time). I always get 2 or 3 basic rolls, which are usually under $5 each. My favorites are the spicy yellowtail, Alaska roll, and the Xmas roll. Note!!! They cut their rolls into 6 pieces, which are WAY TOO BIG. So I always request that they are cut into 8 pieces, which are then normal-sized (to me, at least). Plus, it makes me feel like I have more sushi. If you like tuna, I'd highly recommend the Toro Roll. It is a bit more pricey, but uses scrumptious pieces of fatty tuna. Bold tuna flavor, presented in a simple roll. I also recently discovered the Toro sashimi, which is cheaper, if you just want to try the fatty tuna. 

I'd also recommend their boba (or bubble tea), if you are feeling a cool, sweet pairing with your food.

Would've been a five-star, but a star off for the sort of awkward, almost absent-minded demeanor of the service.

But aside from that, it was almost too good to be true.  Pricing wasn't unreasonable, totaling $150 for 3 adults, 3 drinks ($8 mimosas and bloody marys), including 20% tip and 10% Yelp check-in discount (hooray!).  More lunch than breakfast, this buffet featured some of the best quality food--especially seafood and meat--I have come across in any restaurant, buffet-style or not.  Enormous bluepoint oysters on the half, succulent, perfectly-done prime rib carved in 1-inch slabs, juicy, thick-bodied shrimp cocktail served with a spicy cocktail sauce, a crepe station where crepes were cast before your eyes and onto your plate, topped with heavenly-rich whipped mascarpone and berries--just to name a few of my favorite selections.  And mind you, all of this was NEVERENDING.  It was hard not to feel as if I'd been thrown back in time to join some Greco-Roman bacchanal of epic proportions--if only the backed bar stools on which we were perched were velvet divans!  Going on my tenth oyster, under the disgusted gaze of my engorged fellow-diners, I moved a few centuries ahead to wonder if this was what lunch felt like to the average Madison Ave. executive on a work day...

The only hitch was the wait staff seemed somewhat at a loss, constantly rushing about yet hard to flag for basic requests like new glasses and restocking plates, despite the mere handful of customers present--there couldn't have been more than 6-7 tables occupied total.  We had the sense they weren't accustomed to the buffet set-up, but they were cheerful and obliging and seemed to try their best to attend to us.  Namecards for each dish would've been helpful at the buffet as well as no menu was provided, but we could always ask servers if we couldn't do a visual ID on a dish so that wasn't a huge issue.

If the Mother's Day buffet is any representation of Grotto's daily fare, I'll certainly be back.  The decor's a little cheesy--think Tuscan on a Target/Lowe's budget--but there's plenty of natural lighting and intimate nooks for any respectable lunch date/date night.",2012-05-14 13:45:10

The pita pizza: a soft pita shell with pesto, tomatoes, chicken and cheese. BORING. 
This appetizer reminded me of my mother's Irish cooking: tasteless. A simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem. 
Entree 1: Beer battered fish and Mac and cheese. Ruling: BLAND. My husband ordered this one and described the fish as ""wet"" and the Mac and cheese as ""play-doh"". They also served the dish with lettuce, tomato and onion, as if it were a sandwich. 
Entree 2: Fish tacos. Ruling: OVERCOOKED/COVER-UP ATTEMPTED. Ok, so they weren't bad, but the fish was dry. Covered with tomatoes and a bit of lettuce, the tacos were, again, on the tasteless side. The attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream.

I like the ""chicken duck egg in sticky rice wrap"" the most.  The sticky rice wraps are opened up and presented like a sandwich on the lotus leave with duck egg yolk on top.  The bottom is seared and crispy.  But there are a few chicken strips on the side drenched in sweetened brown sauce; they are dry and tough.  The ""special BBQ pork bun"" is a must try; the baked pineapple buns are soft and fluffy and the BBQ pork is delicious.   ""Eel rice noodle roll"" is delish..

The steamed meatballs don't have garnish drenched in sweetened brown sauce, but instead, they are each sat on a slice of bitter squash and circled by a few corns.  The bitter squash had lost the greenish color, and it had been overcooked.  Shrimp dumpling is embellished with shrimps and sweetened orange sauce.

Escargots - Never had them in a creamy like sauce, but this worked well.  If only I had... more bread!! Would've loved to sop that up.  A bit salty, but who cares.  I like cream sauces.

Salad - Nice dressing.  Can't complain.

Mains:
Lamb special - Good stew, decent flavor.  Good sauce.  Guess what I would've liked more of with a sauce like that?
Lamb shank - Meat fell of the bone, and the shank was a reasonable size.  We were both full at the end.  Again, had sauce with it, not enough bread!! Grrr.

Desserts:
- Upside down apple cake and profiteroles.  Both very solid performers.

Overall, good food, fair prices.  Not every place in Toronto can say that.",2014-08-03 23:03:41

And I gotta say that each visit left me quite happy considering the quality and variety of the places in the neighbourhood: you either get an ok place for a steep price or a blah experience for a cheap price. The Office, overall, I thought it was quite a decent place for the price you were facing at the end of your visit.

Well, this vision change after my last visit.
Considering that here we are in the downtown core, this place should be busy during lunch hours during the week. Well, it is not. It usually never been but at least there were about 8-10 people. This time there were only 5 because there were 3 of us.
The service is certainly good and feels genuine. 
What left me disappointed was the sudden change in quality of the food.

I've ordered the lunch deal that for that day consisted in a burger with bacon and cheese and the choice of a side between the usual fries, onion rings and the soup of the day.

The burger was in my opinion clearly from a frozen packaging. Small, rubbery and tasteless, it definitely left me very disappointed knowing that the burgers I had before where of a much better quality. The soup, a butternut squash, didn't impress me either but certainly I found it to be better than the main item that unfortunately, I chose to eat first.

The beer at least was fine and along with the service, my rating would more like to be a 2.5 stars.

I'm not so sure I will go back again.

Listen, the service is very good.  Last night I called a take out order in, and it was ready and all wrapped up 20 mins later when i got there to pick it up; server was very friendly.  You also get a good amount of food for the price ($10-$15); you get the piece of fish, two sides (ive only had veges and red beans + rice), and a cornbread muffin.    

However, the fish is just not that good.  I got two orders last night, 1 walleye and 1 snapper, both grilled.  One of the filets look like like some massacred the fish with a dull machete.  The other filet looks appealing, but had some small bones in it.  The taste of both was also very bland, and neither really tasted fresh; rather, they were somewhat tough and dry - so i doubt the fish is actually fresh.   They should also include a lemon wedge.  No idea why they dont.  However, the sides were very good and the muffin was a nice surprise.   

So, you get a decent ""fresh"" fish meal and with a good amount of food for under 15 bucks, so its not that bad.  But, on the other hand, the fish is just not very good.  Maybe if you get it fried it will taste better - but then whats the point of getting fish if your just going to make it unhealthy?",2013-03-07 01:31:02

I've never had a pleasant experience at the USPS but today took the grand prize.   I went with my wife and daughters to turn in passport applications.   This location opens at 8:30AM.   We were there 10 minutes early to secure a place in line.   Once inside, we were told that passport applications are handled by one employee, who happens to arrive for work at 9AM.   It would be nice if the USPS could post a sign - somewhere, anywhere - to inform customers of that important fact.  No apology for the lack of information, please sign in and wait.  Keep in mind my kids are missing the first part of school and I'm late for work.   At 9AM our mystery passport processing employee is still MIA.   Around 9:15 she casually saunters to her station and begins the 10 minute process of warming up her computer, filing her nails, finding her zen, digesting her coffee.  Whatever she was doing up there was agonizingly slow.  Around 9:30AM she calls us up to go over the paperwork.   Another 15 minutes of apathetic service and we are finally out the door.   

Here's the really sad thing:  My review and all the others on Yelp might as well be written in invisible ink.  No one at the USPS gives a crap and I doubt the Postmaster reads these reviews.

I tried the Perigourdin which had magret de canard, caramelized onions, lettuce, tomato and creme de foie gras.  The bread was of high quality and the ingredients themselves combined to make a delicious sandwich.  To top it off I had a strawberry tart for dessert.

There is a good amount of sushi options but in my opinion, not enough appetizer options. Sirloin steak was likely the best dish we had as well as the Mango Roll.  At $15.99 a head for lunch, the price is typical and average (though it is not hard to find cheaper locations). I enjoyed the salmon rose which was actually bite sized (and not over sized) in most places. The portions of food are consistently small including their ramen. For a spicy seafood ramen, there was minimal noodles, one shrimp and one piece of imitation crab (which took 15 minutes to arrive). The desserts also left much to be desired.  Anything that says ""mousse"" is simply flavoured whipped cream (including the chocolate custard cream pudding). The only dessert worth ordering is ice cream and mango pudding. 

Facility: Modern decor and average washrooms.  Sight-lines are bad so unless a server comes walking by, it is hard to get someone's attention. Lighting is very dim compared to the floor to ceiling windows at the front of the restaurant (which causes very awkward lighting and very hard for eyes to adjust coming in and out) which makes it difficult to talk to someone who sits in front of the window. Music is barely audible and noise level is completely dependent on capacity.

Service: SNAIL PACED. My husband and I have experienced this restaurant in the past on weekdays (on which service is relatively timely).  But on this particular Sunday (before the restaurant was packed) there were 6-7 sushi chefs in the back and only about 5 or 6 waitresses working the floor. Food was coming out at almost 20 minute intervals.  We ordered some sweet potato tempura and started a stopwatch.  It took then 26 minutes to deliver this item (after prompting) and there were only TWO SLICES of tempura given to us. The average dish came out 20 minutes or so (and they were brought one at a time). 

I also asked a server for their wifi password to which she said no. I asked a second server and she gave it to me on the spot. So everything seemed a hit or miss when it came to service.  We had three different waitresses take our order/deliver our order/ refill our tea. So I am not entire sure who gets the tip or how they split it. A 10% tip is AUTOMATICALLY charged on your bill by the way.

Overall: Do NOT go on a weekend.  They are horribly understaffed during that time and you'll end up waiting for longer than you can eat your food. We may return another time but definitely not on a weekend.",2013-04-01 22:48:02

We tried brownie swirl, strawberry butter milk, mint chip, honey lavender, Belgian chocolate, and basil lime sorbet.
  
 Maybe the higher temps brought out a lot of people for ice cream today. Maybe the crew was tired because they had a lot of business today. For which I am glad! I like to support local business. The reason I'm giving them four stars (actually 4.5 but they don't have that on the scale )instead of the normal five stars, is that the customer service was a bit lax today.  

There was a mix up when a server told the group behind us to come up to the register to pay because they said they were done choosing. The person then adds another milkshake on to their order, at the register. Our ice cream is scooped, sitting there and they start adding in our stuff to this other party's order. Then they have to  refund it back. 

Then the cooler for a drink of water  for self- service was empty. It was mentioned to the crew and they refilled it about 15 mins later.

 My sorbet got  flavored with chocolate at the bottom of the cup. It made it taste weird.  When I nicely pointed it out to one of the servers, instead of saying sorry and readily replacing the scoop, I received a clipped, snippy explanation why it happened. Followed by a stare and then a flippant, ""Fine""! And a grumble while she scooped another to replace it. This bummed me out. I hope this was just a rare occurrence.

The place was nice, seating is limited. They do have some outside tables. The music is a little too loud. The cashier was patient as we hemmed and hawed and helpful when we asked questions.

He always puts a huge smile on my face and goes far above and beyond to make my experience at Eddie V's perfect. He always knows what I like to drink, makes my martini's perfect every time and when my beverage gets a little warm - he changes my glass - OMG I love him! 
You know when you just finished eating and your beverage has been untouched while you eat - and the second I go to drink it again - Steve is swapping glasses for a cold one. 
In addition, the management actually ordered Creme de Violet for me because I love it w/Hendricks Gin. I feel overwhelmed with love. 

Moving on to the fares - WOW! Best filet I have EVER had - and I have had a few. The cut is always perfect, the temperature is always perfect and they sear the outside until crisp - whoa baby!
The simplest dish - roasted corn - tastes like heaven too. Who would think corn could be so sweet and crisp? They rock it. 
Lobster tacos - need I say more? I think not!! Amazing!

Friday night trying to find a spot in the strip to eat after facing my crushed dreams of eating at Gaucho and it only taking 20 minutes to get through the line. I decided to go to Kaya. when my friends and I walk in Kaya we wont be seated for another 1.5 hours- we say no to reservations and walk out. upon walking out we decide to spontaneously try the first spot we see which is CAVO. 

We walk in and there is no greeting or waiter to seat us. Just a bar maybe 15-20 people drinking at the bar, a couple lounge tables near the bar- the inside was huge it seemed like a club venue, but it was only 730- no club is really in operation at 730- so after we were interrogated/questioned by a Butch lady who was convinced we showed up for her birthday and felt the right to ask each of us what our current relationship status was... we thought it was a private party.

No one has kicked us out yet and we were all really hungry, so we decided to venture deeper into the building where we saw it open up into a second, event larger room with 2 bars. This is where we caught the waiter, who apologized and took us back to where the bar was to seat us. 

So finally we get the menu, not too many items to choose from, but i got fish tacos and a steak salad! After about 15 minutes and a couple refills  the waiter brought us our food... AND  IT WAS INCREDIBLE. The salad was absolutely mouth watering with an array of cheese nuts berries accompanying the steak and lettuce- it knocked my socks off. I wish I had gotten more tacos because they were beautiful and insanely delicious. 

The club was clean, service was good once found, to eat it is definitely lively and loud, looked like a fun place to hang out for the night as well.

Got there finally in 1 piece! They were pretty packed on a Thursday night. We waited no more then 10 mins and the lights on the beeper box was flashing. We were quickly silted in booths. The booths are getting old, I sit down and hit the wood part of the booth. OUCH. I thought I was my big butt, but my mom mentioned the same thing. Our waiter was fabulous. She was patient and nice. My parents took forever to pick something. 

Dad ordered: Seafood Alfredo - He ate 3/4 of it and loved it. 
Mom ordered: Chicken Marsala - She ate 1/2 of it and loved it. 
Brother ordered: Meatballs and Spaghetti - He ate all of it and licked the plate. LOL! 
I ordered: Chicken Parmesan - I ate most of it and thought it was a little salty but good 

Our appetizer of Chicken flat bread came late (middle of the dinner). It was so good. It was nice of the waiter to take it off the bill. She did not have it.

Alcachofas Fritas- Fried Artichokes, Maldon Salt and Aioli - I swear, I have almost called a dozen times to just grab this for take out. I dream of this dish.

Ensalada de Col Rizada con Queso Salado - I am not a fan of eggs but this Kale, Ricotta salad with pine nuts and crispy poached pee wee eggs was pretty tasty

I hardly eat them as the bagel shops in Toronto don't make good Montreal-style bagels (except for Gryfe's). However whenever I visit Montreal, I make an effort to travel to one of the best bagel shops in the city. 

I like the fact there's variety at Fairmount. Say what you will about the other shops who claim that bagels should only come in two or three flavours maximum, I disagree. If you can make a tasty garlic-flavoured bagel then you have my vote as being one of the best bagel shop in the city. I tend to go to the other place further down the street out of loyalty and reputation, but Fairmount is a fair contender in the bagel wars.  

With an assortment of flavours, I bought plain, sesame and garlic. I practically lived on these during my 24 hours stint in the city.

We both ordered drinks - my pomegranate sparkler was delicious! It was the perfect refreshment to celebrate the return of warm weather. The calamari we ordered was the best calamari I have ever had. Instead of the small over cooked and greasy ringlets most restaurants serve the calamari at Dressler's is cut into long juicy strips and is topped with a glorious peanut sauce that has wasabi drizzled without. We also sampled the crab cake, which was good but paled in comparison to the calamari. 
After a brief interlude with a split wedge salad (a salad came with the deal) we got to taste our entrees. My filet was done perfectly and the cut was one of the more tender steaks I have had. The asparagus were lightly seasoned over creamy mashed potatoes. The only flaw was the sauce on the filet was a little too sweet and I think it would have been better done if the cut of the steak was more lightly seasoned to show off the natural deliciousness of a filet.
We ended with the cheesecake which had an enviable lightness, though neither of us cared for the cinnamon sprinkled on top.

-Spring mix (veggies)
-Salmon (protein) 
-Corn, Avocado, Tomato, Shredded crab meat, and seaweed salad (4 condiments)
-Spicy mayo (Dressing)
-Green onion and Tempura bits (to cap off the toppings)

I called that day and was able to get an appointment with Hannah. At first I just thought she had an accent, but then she told me she was hearing impaired, and since she only reads lips, wouldn't be chatting with me during the cut so she focus on my hair. 

I personally LOOOOVED this. I hate when people I don't know feel like they are forced to make small talk with me for an hour. I don't care about your kids, or your boyfriend, and I don't really want to tell you about my life either... Just do my hair, and make it look good. (sorry if this sounds bitchy, but it's sooooo true, and I know I'm not the only one out there) So anyways, right off the bat I freakin' loved her! 

Now onto the cut. Very good. She worked fast and efficiently. Took my lifeless, split end, damaged hair, and make it look healthy and shiny.

Style/Blow Out - AMAAAAAZING. This is after all what they are known for. I have thick curly hair that I always blow out, but then that needs to be smoothed out with a flat iron.

We started our experience with being greeted and seated very promptly.  We met our server Jade and she was outstanding as well.  We decided to start with the wings and my wife had the house salad.  They both arrived shortly there after and let me tell you the Ranch dressing was out of this world!  My wife loved the salad and the blue cheese dressing and her salad as well.  Then I went for my first wing?  Yep, you guessed it the chicken was spoiled.  That really sucks because the sauce was great as well!  Next my son got the personal deep dish cheese pizza and the wife got the lasagna, me I got the entree size Italiano salad.    So let's go from worst to first.  The salad was the worst.  Way to much Vinegar in the dressing kind of ruined the salad.  The lasagne  was a good attempt but just fell short of the mark being that is one of the dishes Gio's is known for, 1 ball, 2 strikes,  now for the best.  My son and wife both lived the pizza!  So at the end of the night Gio's gets 2 stars.  Not sure we will come back or not.  However we tried.

So the day after my review of Gio's I received a message from one of the managers apologizing for the bad experience we had and asked my family and I to return and give them another chance.  The same day I received a phone call from Vicki the general manager of Gio's expressing the same message and asking my wife son and I to join her for dinner.  I agreed and we scheduled our visit for Friday evening.  

We had basically the same dinner with a few minor changes, let me tell you our experience was the exact opposite of our previous experience.  The food was great!!!  The service was great!!

I checked out their website ahead of time, which has a ""vegan"" tab for each Ike's location, so I was already familiar with some of the vegan offerings.  But when I arrived, there were so many more options jumping out a me. Luckily, the employees know their stuff when it comes to their vegan menu, and they were able to answer my questions.

I ordered the Handsome Owl (sans cheese): vegan chicken, teriyaki, Wasabi Mayo, lettuce, onions, pickles, & banana peppers, on Ike's World Famous Dutch Crunch bread. OMG! I don't know what sorcery they used to conjure up that bread's amazing and unique flavor, but it is phenomenal! The combinations of all the flavors that encompass the sandwich is ingenious.  My mind is blown. It's a $10 sandwich, but it's huge, filling, and worth every single penny.  I will certainly return to try all of the vegan combinations. 

They sell Zapp's potato chips, which come in a variety of colorfully named flavors, like ""Voodoo Heat,"" ""Hotter'N Hot Jalapeño,""Sweet Creole Onion,"" etc.  Looking at the ingredients on the bags (and I have since checked Zapp's website), it appears that only the Salt & Vinegar, and BBQ Ranch chips are not vegan (they contain a milk product), and all except the Mesquite BBQ are gluten-free. However, the source of the natural smoke flavor and ""natural flavor"" needs to be confirmed.  I also spotted MSG in at least one flavor.

I tried the Hotter'N Hot Jalapeño chips. I wasn't impressed. 0 heat. Not 1 hint of spice. And the taste was a little off; almost on the stale side, but the bag showed a November expiration date. Not sure what that was about. Next time I'll try a different flavor to see if there's any change. 


Management informed me of the following:

50% of the veggie sandwiches can be made vegan upon request. 
They use Daiya for the vegan cheese, Tofurkey for the vegan turkey, and Gardein for the vegan chicken and meatballs. 
All of their breads are vegan except for the wheat (it's honey wheat).
The wasabi mayo is automatically vegan, so no need to request a vegan version.
Their Dirty sauce is not vegan, but they offer a vegan version, (which is delicious, btw! Add it to your sandwich, or get it on the side and dip your sandwich in it. YUM!)
Fries (called ""Air Fries"") are vegan; they are baked, not fried.
Tater tots are vegan. 

Not vegan:
pesto, & honey mustard sauces, the fried foods, like onion rings & beer battered zucchini (egg based batter), and the obvious (meats and non-vegan cheeses). 
CORRECTION: Their Sun-Devil (a nod to Arizona State University/ ASU) is not vegan, & they do NOT have a vegan version. (The photo I added is actually their vegan Dirty sauce.)

Their veggie bacon is vegetarian; not vegan

Gluten-free bread available upon request.

I love the way it's decorated. It has a very warm, happy, and welcoming vibe. Friendly and vegan-knowledgable employees. Fountain drinks or bottled drinks available. Open late (until midnight) on Fri/Sat. There are few outside tables. Located in the heart of Tempe, next to the Bank of America off Mill, between 6th & 7th.

  Cruising on Scottsdale Road it is so easy to mistake Scottsdale Quarter for an Apple Store next to a few high end shops. Unlike  typical shopping centers, cute urbanism does not overdue it with advertising the stores to passing motorists. We discovered the Scottsdale Quarter on a walk from the Sleep Inn to the Apple Store.

  I am more of a foodie than a shopper. In my case, Scottsdale Quarter is a nice place to go see a movie, sip a coffee in Press Coffee, people watch, and grab a bite to eat. Being a former New Yorker I was glad to see Grimaldi's Pizza.

  Scottsdale Quarter is a good mall. It's strong points are people scale architecture, a nice park that features a fountain, and nice restaurants and shops. It's weak points are that it is a representation of a village without residential and a grocery store. Another weakness is that it is a representation of a pedestrian scale village that is primarily accessible by the automobile.

Didn't even know this place existed because it's so small and random. I did end up ordering the lavender milk tea with less ice since I was curious to know what it tasted like. And my friend ordered the soft serve sesame/earl-grey ice cream in a cup. It was delivered to us with these pretty edible rice paper butterflies on the ice cream. So pretty I didn't want to eat it and ruin the look. The ice cream was tasty but I wouldn't get sesame + earl-grey ice cream together since the sesame ice cream was way to over powering and you barely taste the earl-grey. But when you eat the earl-grey ice cream on its own it was heavenly. 

The two items we ordered: 
* Lavender Milk tea 
* Earl-Grey + Sesame soft serve ice cream in a cup

For lunch there is a buffet bar with all you can eat sushi - which is awesome.  I definitely went a little crazy and left very full.  The sushi wasn't the best ever, but enough to satisfy my palate and a great value for weekday lunch.  Dinner is the standard order-from-menu sushi fare.  Ru San's has an overwhelming amount of selection.  They have a lot of inventive rolls with ingredients all over the place - I think I had one with beef at one point.  The crazy rolls are about $7 or $8.  Additionally they have a ""value"" section of standard choices that you can get for $1, which is fun and affordable.  I chose a crazy roll and a few value items and had a great meal.  On the weekend night I went to Ru San's the atmosphere was very festive - there were a ton of young people and electronicish music.  There was some crazy bachelorette party at one of the large tables (good for groups!) in the back.  They have Asian inspired art on the wall that is signed by ""Ru San.""

They are closing soon to go onto bigger and better things and that to me is a shame. I loved the decor and the atmosphere. The man at the front who identified himself as the owner was so nice. He let us pick our spot and was ready on hand to help with any questions on the menu. 

With the check in for Yelp I was able to score a free glass of tea. I picked the mint and it was a joy to drink after the meal. I am a tea lover and it was steeped to perfection. Yum. Already I felt at home and that I would love it here. 

Appetizer:

For the appetizer I picked to eat one of the soups on the menu. I was really interested in the African Peanut Soup because I made a slight version of this with chicken and wanted to see how theirs stacked up. 

African Peanut Stew: Sweet potatoes slow-simmered with tomatoes, ginger, garlic, coriander and a hint of cayenne. This stew was perfection. I loved how the flavors melded together in my mouth. Not at all to spicy but just enough to enjoy all the tastes that were moving over my taste buds. I would get this again and bump it up from a bowl to a trough please! The presentation was also beautiful. I loved how the dish was served kind of like a little art piece. 

Main Course:

Meatball Sandwich:Seasoned meatballs made with lentils, brown rice and oats topped with marinara, mozzarella and parm. Not a fan of the sandwich. It was served on a hotdog bun and that could not take the weight of the meatballs. The sandwich had a lot less cheese than I would have liked. For a meatball sandwich I need a lot of mozzarella and parm, this had the bare minimum. I also decided to go with the coleslaw which was a really weird combo that didn't go well together at all. I should have known better but I felt rushed in my choice. Like oh gosh, he is here just pick! I am sure he would have let me have some time but when you are on a lunch break time is of the essence. The meatballs were also just a little much for me to handle. They were just a little gooey for my taste. I should have done something more basic. But for my first time I wanted it to be exciting. I was disappointed. It was just meh...

I would love to come here again and get the stew and something different on the menu. I would have loved to get the Reuben but it was crossed off the menu. Online it says Tuesdays only, but  maybe they took it off?

I will say that my co-worker tried the taco salad and loved it. She thought that the tofu was wonderful and seasoned really well. The sauces that came with it were in her words spot on. I really watched her enjoy her meal while I struggled a bit with mine.

I was not disappointed.

Let's start with the Food experience: 

We came at prime dinner time with a party of 6. As the place is smaller, filled with two seaters, a lively bar, we were seated upstairs in one of their few booths. I love this. From the top, you get a view of the whole restaurants, where you can watch the people below dine, the food servers scrambling about caring the open faced tacos which sizzle and smell tantalizing. The menu is simple: One half is starters, starting with chips and salsa, and ending poke, chopped and papa bravas [variety ensembles of salads and small bites], the second half is filled with their signature tacos which are serve in sets of 2. On the back of the menu you find an array of signature cocktails made from their wall of tequilas and mezcal. [more on that later]. In addition, there is a daily specials menu highlighting some of their fresh ensembles of the day and a crazy ""build-your-own"" guacamole bar, which my friend J was ALL OVER. 

We ordered the Chips and Salsa as well as the selection of guac that J crafted together as we waited for our drinks. My ""Sookie Stackhouse"", a frozen margarita style drink, garnished with a special set of wax poured FANGS. I enjoy the occasional gimmick like that. It was served with homemade tortilla chips and a generous heaping of cilantro on guac, which, btw, was creamy with some depth in flavor.

I did a split with a friend for the taco. I HAD to try the Tako Taco, for one, as it is the namesake taco, made with Tako's patron spirit animal [Octopus] as the star ingredient, as well as the Mushroom Taco, a veggie taco with Mushrooms and burnt brussels. Floored. By the nth degree, the Mushroom stole the show. A good balance of veggies, paired with oaxaca cheese and garlic aioli. Absolutely fantastic. While the Octopus was done really well, I was upset that it was slightly buried by the accompanying harissa aioli. I personally would have made it more lemony because I love lemony Tako, but as with everything, that's just personal preference. However, it granted me my additional delight of eating a Tako Taco and thereby referencing my favorite youtube video show MPGIS [in this case episode 41]. I chuckle... anyways, moving on.

Service was great with a decisive flow to it. Jacen is great, vivacious, and made sure that we were served with good speed and recommendations. Definitely a thrill. Impending service was equally executed. My reservation was completed online and so they called to remind me of my reservation both by email, as well as via phone call and we easily were guided to our seats upon arrival. 

Now to my favorite parts of the restaurant:

First, the decor. The art around the room is fantastic. For its namesake, Tako, there is a huge Octopus covering the main wall. From the top floor, you look the beast square in the eye, from the lower level, it towers over the patrons, watching them devour tacos or simply waiting itself to devour the patrons, take your pick. On the top wall, you get a view of the last supper. Quite ominous.

Second, the garage style kitchen. Watch your tacos be made right from the sidewalk view or have them served to you street side . I'm totally interested how they are going to do this in the Winter time. 

Third and final, the duality between the restaurants. With the same owners, Tako mirrors and compliments the space of butcher and the rye next door. From the linking walkway between the restaurants, to the opposite placements of the kitchens and the back-to-back bars, it creates split yet intermingled worlds, one in the depths of bourbon and rye, the other a world of tequilas and mezcal. In the end they are all drawn together under the watching eye of the Octopus.

The experience at Tako is solid, the food is complex and delectable, giving the patrons an opportunity to dive into a dark world for a couple of hours outside the real world. A solid 4.5 stars, which will only be topped once I sit at the bar, stare into the cooking fires making the remaining menu items I left untasted and hear the gentle shaking of ice in making another S. Warren cocktail, only the essence and standard I expect of a DeSchantz establishment.",2015-10-22 01:22:12

My wife and I are into all kinds of Asian food - except, somehow, Chinese. It wasn't like that before. We definitely had been a Chinese food lover when in Hong Kong / Taiwan / Japan, but when we moved to the US, first to the San Francisco Bay Area, things changed. We found quite a few nice Chinese restaurants including Yank Sing in SF, Tai Pan in Palo Alto, Little Sichuan in San Mateo and Hunan Home's in Mountain View. But the number is disproportionately small compared to other Asian cuisine. We've tried many, and been disappointed more often than not. At the end of the day, we developed the unconscious habit to avoid Chinese restaurants.

The situation got worse after moving to Vegas. We tried many, and those attempts ended up futile.

So when we heard about Lao Sze Chuan, we didn't have a high hope - but this place turned out to be a great surprise!

- Tony's chili chicken
- Crispy shrimp with lemon sauce
- Don don noodle
- Dim sum: Shu mai
- Pork & rgg congee

Everything was tasty, and the portion was perfect for sampling with two people. I expected spicy food for being Sichuan, but for instance the don don noodle had just right amount of spiciness.

The best part? Reasonable pricing. In fact it's more than reasonable considering it's in the Palms Casino Resort.

Thank you Tony Hu, we finally found a place to return to.",2014-10-02 06:22:42

I guess I don't understand why Americans in droves are so enamored over a large slab of tasteless beef that costs $30? I have had my share through the years, but I prefer a Filet Mignon, Porterhouse, or NY Pepper steak instead. I think the best part of Prime Rib is the Horse Raddish!

But Lawry's can make most people a fan, because they do it well. They employ the large metal table-side carts, just like House of Prime Rib does on Van Ness in The City. 

They have at least 5 different sized cuts, from small, sliced, medium, large, and super-large in-bone. The most popular is the Lawry's Cut. This is $37, but comes with their tasty, chilled Lawry's Salad, mash potatoes, and bread pudding. You can order optional sides of cream spinach ( I recommend it, it is good) or corn. You are served warmed sourdough -like bread before the meal.

We started in the bar, having 5 of us after a trade show cooling down over cocktails, and talking shop. They have great crunchy potato chips in the bar. You are seated by a hostess when your table is ready, served by a waitress, and a separate chef carves up your meat and plates it for you, table-side

4 of us ordered the Lawry's Cut with a side of creamed spinach. The fifth order the one increment larger Jim Brady Cut. It is a lot of food, especially after we started with 2 plates of calamari appetizers to split, which came with a tasty Chipotle spiced Aoili dip. 

The service is great, the food is very good, and the ambiance is nice and relaxed. 

Lawry's on Flamingo in the Hughes Center between Paradise and Las Vegas Blvd (the strip).

The 5 star review is strictly based on the Brisket and Ribs.  I have not yet tried any of the other meats, and I wasn't very fond of the sides that I tried.  More on the sides in a moment.  

I ordered a two meat platter.  The ribs were perfectly cooked, very tasty, and not sauced (which is how I prefer them).  They were delicious, and even better when I warmed up my leftover ribs the next day.  The brisket, which I requested fatty and sliced with some bark on it, was the best I've had here in Arizona.  It was moist, flavorful, had nice texture and was delicious although the bark was a bit on the salty side from the course salt that they seasoned it with before cooking.  I hadn't had brisket that good since back when I lived in Texas.  The meat was definitely 5 stars, and I can't wait to go back to try the other meats.

I know that folks taste in BBQ sauce is a matter of personal preference.  To be honest, I couldn't really tell the difference between Naked's sweet sauce and the spicy sauce, and I didn't care for either of them - but I am one of those people who has pretty specific sauce preferences.  Both sauces were too sweet for me, so I just left them off.  The meat was good enough to stand on its own any day.

The ribs were only warm, and the brisket was about room temperature but that didn't make a difference to me.

Now, the sides... The cornbread muffin was just ok.  The mac & cheese was better than a lot of places, but it was not warm enough.  I was glad that green beans (seasonal vegetable varies) were available as a healthy option, but I didn't care for whatever seasoning they used on them and they too were not warm.  Since I didn't go for the sides, I'm sticking to 5 stars for Naked BBQ and will plan on just enjoying the meat there next time.  I did love the watermelon iced tea!  

Their prices seemed a bit on the hgh side, but given the quality of the BBQ, I will gladly spend my money to eat here in the future!

I should mention that service was fast, helpful and friendly.  As I ate the owner and another individual (manager?) stopped by my table to say hello and make sure my food was ok.

A couple of notes:  They do sell out of items on busy days, and sliced brisket is not available in sandwiches, only chopped.",2017-05-03 21:17:48

See, when I think old school diner, I expect a crowd of old people and a waitress who has... well, who has been beaten down by life and is still standing out of tenacity and spite. Instead there are young, attractive ladies (a friend called them hangover hotties) serving us, and a mix of young trendy kids and old bikers enjoying the food. 

The coffee was typical diner coffee, maybe a little pricy.

Then the food came. Both my wife and I come from breakfast loving families, so we have high standards. The biscuits were at first disappointing, looking like dinner rolls. But they tasted right, and were actually not bad. The chorizo and egg was definitely gringo style, but some cholula fixed that. The omelette wasn't her dad's omelette, but they were dang generous with the bacon. Beans were good, but the potatoes were like a blank canvas, in need of your ketchup, hot sauce, and salt and pepper accents.

Overall the experience was teetering between 3 stars and 4. It was pretty good overall, but the great service gave me that extra push. They live up to the four star rating.",2015-05-31 16:35:32

It was my first time and I was confused with the set up but a couple of the girls with us had been there before. It's a beautiful place. We walked in, got a card from the hostess at the front, found seating, grabbed a menu and then you go to the station of your choice. I went to the pasta station first, they scanned my card and I ordered my pasta with olive oil, chili peppers, garlic and black pepper, hold the cheese. I then went to the salad station where this young lady was cleaning some equipment and didn't seem thrilled that I wanted a salad. I ordered two garden salad all the while getting the, you're bugging me and I want to go back to cleaning so I can get out here look! Oh well! I am a certified servsafe manager which means I took a course on food safety and handling and passed with flying colors. I noticed she didn't wash her hands although she did change her gloves. 
Pasta was delicious and I actually ordered more. This time one with a red sauce, extra chilies and again, very good. I never order pasta when I eat out because it so cheap and easy to make at home but I broke tradition and went for it. 
My daughter had the shrimp Alfredo pasta, loved it! Her friend had the calzone, huge!! But they put a small tomato in the middle to keep it puffed up so it looks like it's filled with stuff but it's really just a tomato causing the illusion. Ha! Good one. 
So everything you order gets scanned on the card and when you are done you go to the checkout with your card and pay. Definitely an honor system kind of set up.  So don't walk out without paying folks! It's stealing! LOL!

I chose to come here because of the supposed great quality for less. It was a bit more than I was expecting. Technicians answered their phones multiple times with fairly lengthy conversations, delaying my stay( 2 hours for a gel french mani and a pedi). Typically, salon experiences are supposed to be relaxing. The World Cup blaring from a large flat screen made this difficult. Not to mention it was not well ventilated. I thought I was going to pass out. The exterior is less than appealing. I have been to my fair share of hole in the wall restaurants, antique shops, etc. and loved them, so I am no snob. Upon entering, it seemed to match the outside. 

The technicians themselves were less friendly than other salons I've been to in the past as well. There is no small talk, just little conversation about what you want done. But, be careful. You may get criticized for what you're going for, albeit being the one paying for it. In addtion, if you show them pictures of what you want, numerous times, odds are, the outcome will not come close to correlating.

$58 dollars and two hours later, I am filled with such a bad feeling. I'm bummed I payed that much for the shotty work( chips already on two of my toes and trust me, I am careful with nails) that was done in an unclean feeling environment.  I say this because not once did I see a tool be removed from barbicide before being used on me.

Service was okay, not great, but nothing really bad to say, other than our server didn't have much of a personality, but we can't all be winners.  Overall, a lot of the flavors were just off.

Started with Stuffed Portabella - two portabella mushrooms covered in a really salty cream cheese with three grilled shrimp on each mushroom cap.  The mushroom and shrimp were good but the crazy amount of salt in the cream cheese just ruined it.

Lemon Chicken breast was my entree.  Came with potatoes and sauteed vegetables.  The sides were great but the chicken tasted like a crap ton of that imitation lemon juice had been poured all over it.  Really not very good.  Made me wonder if the chef actually tries a dish before he serves it in the restaurant.  I tried my Aunt's halibut and it was a little dry but pretty good.

In case you are not familiar with Boba and want to try out something new here are a few details:

Boba comes from Tapioca (Root), it is steamed and put into the bottom of your drink in a gelatin ball form.
There is the traditional Boba, larger, black and round, and other fruit flavors.

The most popular Boba Tea Drink is Taro, which is made from a potato like plant. The drink will look bright purple, but do not be alarmed it is fantastic! By far my favorite.

Now - back to reviewing!!  Boba Tea House is great if you are there for their Tea. Their food on the other hand is all fried, greasy and not falvorful. If you want a quick snack it is good. But I would only come here for the Boba.

Chicken enchilada omlet:  very tasty.  could have used a touch of spice.  but over all I'd get it again. 

Western omlet:  filled with goodness and the person ordering it took the other 1/2 he couldn't consume at the table..home. and he never ever takes home left overs.  

Bandito scramble:  nice combo but kind of bland.  not enough chorizo to make it --wait for it -- EGGciting enough.  

Coffee was delicious.  Of course any coffee for me is delicious if they are not serving Star bucks or Seattle's best.  

Banana muffin.. worth the entire meal.  Moist, delicious and the alternative to extremely dry toast.

Once I signed in, one of the threaders sat me down and asked if I wanted my brows done. I told her, ""no thanks, just my lip"" and she asked if I was sure.

There were an array of items ordered at the table; I got the chicken shawarma plate & others had gotten the combination plate (vegetarian & non-vegetarian), the chicken kabobs, etc.

As far as my dish goes, I thought the quality and quantity was spot on. The chicken was tender and delicious; it went really well with the rice and the garlic sauce was a good addition but I didn't find it to be necessary (which is not how it is at some other restaurants). I'm not a huge fan of tabouli but I liked how they had made it here, it didn't have an over-powering taste. I'm very critical of hummus typically and I enjoyed this one. It wasn't lemon-y and tasted so good with the pita. I snagged a couple of bites from my friends combination plate and I thought everything from that also tasted good.

My best friend and I were in the area because we wanted to go to High Park. We were hungry and craving a burger, so after searching nearby restaurants, this one came up and we decided to pay a visit.

Upon arrival, we had to wait for a while because there was no server around. Once she came, she provided us with a table and wow, it was burning hot in the restaurant! Sadly, the service was horrible. It was extremely hard to get our server's attention despite only 3 tables being full (3 including us). Trying to ask for items, placing the order and even getting the bill was a drag. Even though she hardly checked on us and disappeared for quite some time, she was nice.

The restaurant itself was really clean which I loved. It had a different vibe, but a good one.

The food? Wow, it was amazing! A lot of my friends kept raving about the burgers here and I've been wanting to try it. I'm so happy I came here. I got the Juicy Lucy burger and it was delicious. The size of the burger was insane, it was huge! Definitely worth the money. As my side, I got sweet potato fries, but it wasn't amazing. I definitely had better sweet potato fries elsewhere.",2018-05-16 01:43:47

We weren't disappointed. 

After walking by the place and into the Patagonia store next door, we peeked into the alley beside it and found the lovely glass enclosed restaurant. 

We were seated outside on the semi-enclosed patio which was nice on the warm but drizzly day. 

Prepared to re-live our Spanish culinary adventures, we started with a bottle of delicious rosé cava. It arrived perfectly chilled and our waitress kept us constantly refilled.

We ordered a bunch of tapas to share and everything was fantastic and as authentic as we remembered it to be in Spain. 

The cured meats were fresh - both the jamon serrano and the chorizo were delicious. 

The croquetas de jamon were particularly good - so much so that we added a second order of croquetas de manchego which were equally tasty. The albòndigas (lamb meatballs) were also very good. 

We were a little disappointed with our octopus dish which wasn't bad....but wasn't spectacular either. 

For desert we ordered the churros and the chocolate pudding with olive oil and sea salt. The churros were a little dry but the chocolate pudding was phenomenal!
We had first tried chocolate with olive oil in Barcelona and were excited to taste it again - we weren't disappointed. The pudding came served with a ""candy"" filled with olive oil which our waiter broke into the pudding and then mixed it. It was mouthwatering and as good as we remembered it to be. 

The service was excellent and well-paced. 
Our dishes were well spaced out and brought out by a variety of waiters/waitresses who took the time to explain each dish. Our particular favourite was a Spanish waiter who explained the dish with an adorable accent. 

We were seated next to a group of local ladies and had such a great time with them that we ended up sharing food off of each other's plates - in true tapas fashion!",2013-07-04 16:53:09

We all received salad, miso soup, and a tiny bowl of noodles to start. Then, lo and behold, the waiter comes out with two plates each of calamari, grilled salmon, and raw oysters- all on the house! I was surprised that we got so many free appetizers. They also gave us mango ice-cream at the end of our meal.

The sushi was pretty good- I like that there's a lot of filling and a minimal amount of rice. The sashimi was average and did not taste very fresh. The spicy pizza came with spicy salmon on top, and was very savoury and crispy. As for the fire viking roll, it came out wrapped in tin foil, on a sizzling hot plate. The chef then lit the plate on fire. To be honest, it was cool to watch but I feel like the fire did not add to the taste at all. 

In terms of service, the waiter and waitress were friendly, but they didn't come back to check up on us at all, after serving all the food. I suppose we were expected to use the 'call' button to request for service, but it would be nice if they came back to check up on us at least once, considering the restaurant wasn't even that busy for a Sunday night.",2016-05-01 03:20:37

I called in an order for pick-up. The guy put me on hold but I hung up after hearing him chat the whole time with another customer about irrelevant stuff. Second time I called the guy took my order and I liked how fast he turned around my order, said it would be ready in 15 minutes. 

The restaurant is a bit small but it's really cute. It has an outdoor seating area with shades and a water fountain. The inside looks very clean and organized. I ordered two gyro sandwiches and a combo which comes drink and fries. The guy that took my order was a lot nicer in person and very cute I must say. When I got home I chowed down and it was satisfying but not out of this world. The amount of meat was good, how gyros should be, but it was not that marinated it was bland. The tzatziki sauce did not taste much like cucumber or the fresh dill it's described as but it had a lot of feta which made it taste better. The fries were ok.

I want to give the greek bowl a chance. Place is convenient for Hendersonians but I rather drive and use my gas tank to Las Vegas and go to The Fat Greek on the corner of Flamingo and Decatur.

Now for the positives.  The pizza we ordered was very good.  The wait staff was polite and reasonably on top of things.

First, I love the atmosphere. They completely opened up the ceiling with sky scrapers placed throughout the restaurant.

You can see the chefs making the food in the kitchen and an open bar area holds comfortable couches as well as high tops. It's very fresh and airy for being inside a corporate building! 

Now let's move on to the food, oh my the food! I can only review the lunch menu since I've only been for lunch, but if the dinner menu's anything like lunch, then I'm a fan. My two menu highlights are the Havarti turkey sandwich and the delectable chocolate caramel peanut bacon sundae! That might not be the correct name, but that's how I like to describe it! The Havarti Turkey sandwich has freshly roasted turkey with a cranberry jam, sprouts and fresh cracked wheat bread. It's accompanied by a salad and a perfectly fresh lunch.

We also tried the homemade cold tofu, which was brought out and served at the table.

We tried the small crab and tofu soup and this was very good! Lots of crab meat in the bowl, the broth was thick but very light, definitely a healthier option. We got the Napa Cabbage in egg yolk sauce... We were skeptical when it was first brought out because it looked like a big plate of boiled cabbage, but this was delicious! It tasted like they used salted egg for the sauce, you can clearly taste the egg yolk, creamy but not too much where you get sick of it. Definitely should try this item!! 

We got the Triple Chili Pork which was alright, it had lots of chili and chili oil in the dish which made my tongue tingled! Not gross but not very flavorful either. 

Now let me talk about the Pork Tenderloin Fried Rice... Oh my goodness... So good! It smelled amazing and tasted just as good!! The pork was very tender and soft, the rice was perfectly seasoned, lots of black peppers on the rice which gave it such an amazing taste!

For this reason, i'm really trying to resist the temptation to review a spot after just one visit.  This weekend i hit Beckett's for the third time.

Everyone is raving about Beckett's and with fair reason, it's pretty good.  But let's drill down a bit further and see if it's really all it's cracked up to be.  

Apps: 
* Brussels Sprouts are good, but i think it's just a trendy item to toss onto your menu these days.  
* The enchiladas are alright, but they don't ""wow"" anyone.  let's face it... this just isn't the place for enchiladas in the PHX.  
* What is wrong with this: ""beckett's original grilled cheese with pancetta (aka bacon)""  [Hint: ""aka""] Pancetta is not Bacon.  Pancetta, like bacon, is also made from pork belly,  But pancetta is rolled and cured, bacon is smoked. The flavor is decidedly different.  

Mains:
* The short ribs are great... but then again, i never met a short rib that i didnt like.  I'm a sucker for short ribs on a menu.  
* Chicken & Dumplings... major let down.  (They were out of short ribs, so i asked the server for a reco.)  Dumplings were pretty uneventful.  Chicken was tender, but dude... its chicken.  
*  Tasted the Osso Buco and it was pretty tasty.  

Cocktails and Beer:
Drinks are well poured and fairly inventive.  Not too shabby.
Beer list is so so... some 4peaks and a Stella.  nothing really exciting.  

Dessert:
i *love* the hot/cold combo, so i'll practically make love to anything ""a la mode""   ....naturally the poached pear & blueberry cobbler with ice cream was on my list.   It was about 6000 degrees and you couldnt really taste it.  Also, the icecream was tiny and you need more for the cobbler.

However, the chocolate covered bacon (note: not pancetta, so they clearly know the difference, they just think you are dumb when you read the apps menu.) and PB s'mores were to die for!  

Seriously... this desert is creative, delicious and hands down the best $5 you'll spend all night.  

Bottom line is... Beckett's is pretty good grub, nice ambiance (for a strip mall) and a pretty good menu.  The food isnt amaaaaaaaazing, but it's worth checking out.  If you do anything, come for the s'mores.

Shannon said that when the technician is on his way I will get a call to let me know and that I don't need to keep calling her. Guess what?! I never got a call and the tech showed up.

Qh0_pO1gSoD6fvuOi63ZbA,HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg,37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg,4,8,1,3,"I have been meaning to check out Edulis for sometime, even before enRoute magazine named it the top new restaurant of 2012.  However, my list of ""must-try"" restaurants seems to never die, but I finally made it.

There are several approaches you can take with the menu; such as a 5-course tasting menu for $50; or the larger 7-cousre menu for $70; or simply à la carte.  We ordered 4 dishes, 1 dessert and 2 drinks (1 non-alcoholic) between 2 people and the bill came to about $120 including tax and tip.

It should be noted that the menu does not differentiate an appetizer from a main.  The server explained to us that the size of the offering depends solely on the dish itself.  This presents a bit of difficulty in terms of gaging how much food would fill you. I was comfortably full with what we ordered.

I must say that there was not one dish I did not like at Edulis.  Everything we ate here was rich, flavourful, and a mouthful.

I started with a glass of housemade Szechuan Peppercorn + Ginger soda made with filtered Q water ($3) but found it lacking in either of the signature flavours.  It could've been sweet tea for all I knew.

My partner in dine opted for a glass of Coat Albret Cidre Brut from Brittany, France which I thought was a great drink at $6.

A bread basket along with an olive amuse-bouche was brought out shortly after ordering.  While I loved the crust of the bread, I did not care much for the almost injeera-like texture of the centre of the bread.  

To start we ordered a plate of the Black Perigord Truffle Poached Lobster, Jellied Veal Tail ($32) which came with a fair serving of lobster meat, thin slices of veal tail and large shavings of truffles.  This dish was served lukewarm and the lobster held up against the truffles.  NB. Black truffles are less pronounced in flavour than their white counterparts.

Next up was the Octopus Croqueta, Rice Morcilla, Roasted Onion ($13) which I already knew would be good because the moment they set it down on the table the aroma of this dish filled the small nook by the window where we were seated.  Lightly battered and the paper-thin slices of octopus were done perfectly (read, not overcooked and chewy).  

My 2nd favourite dish of the evening was the Rabbit Porcini Boudin ($15) which was a housemade sausage that was very tender, extremely flavourful and had a nice smokey flavour to it.  Yummy!

The highlight of the evening for me was the Roasted Duck Breast ($19) with braised turnips, Black Trumpets, white bean purée + wild cranberry mostarda.  The textures and flavors just married together very well.

For dessert I opted for the Baba au Rhum ($10) with Chantilly cream and Appleton rum syrup.  The cake soaked up the syrup and the Chantilly cream was a nice distraction from the boozy dessert.  

Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Edulis.  While the ambiance is not the most exciting or fun, it makes for a relaxing meal as the chef takes his time to prepare your dishes from course to course.  When asked what style of cooking they would classify themselves as, the term Bistronomy was used and they prefer to think that they are a Continental European joint not being loyal to any one country's cuisine.

I would definitely come back if good food was the goal of my evening - I'd be extremely interested in coming back for the tasting menu as I spied some delicious dishes being served at the large group table next to us who opted for for the tasting menu.  

P.S.  If you don't like mushrooms, you probably shouldn't come to Edulis.  I love mushrooms and so do they.  Most of the dishes I selected tonight came with some sort of mushroom.",2012-12-20 21:06:49

Some restaurants in this part of town can make one feel a bit weary about actually giving them a shot and trying their food.

Although Pho #1 may not look like much from the outside - it is very nice and extremely clean and well-kept on the inside.  It was a pleasant surprise.

We each tried a few of the shrimp/pork spring rolls, then a few of us tried the pho and one of us went with the chicken fried rice.  

Everything we ordered was very fresh tasting ... I wasn't overly impressed by the spring rolls/fried rice ... They seemed pretty average for the most part.

The only service issue we ran into had to do with the language barrier - the person who ordered the chicken fried rice requested that it be made without eggs, since she was allergic, and it had to be sent back to the kitchen twice before it was properly made without eggs. The 3rd time was the charm, yet having the send food back to the kitchen several times is not so charming. 

The PHO was AMAZING though - I tried the meatball, brisket, steak pho and there was plenty of meat, the broth was hearty, and it was absolutely delicious - out of all the places in AZ that I have tried pho I would say that this is by far the best ... As I said everything we ordered was ""good"" but the PHO was SUPER!  I will definitely be back and will recommend others to try out the best pho in town! ;)",2016-11-29 07:07:42

There was a guy working who was half hipster, but in spite of that, he was cool.  I told him I didn't have cash on me and he said since I live in the neighborhood, I could come back the day after and pay.  He must've trusted my aura and guess what?  I trusted his.  

I saw a red velvet cupcake on the back counter and I wanted it, but I could not have it. This was because they demand perfection and that particular cupcake was only at 98% perfection.  He let me sample it and I almost fainted; It was so good.  It made me a better person in that moment. I also met Jenny the baker who was just lovely and modest about her abilities, and then I got a slice of Carrot Cake.

The first bite was controversially good.  I shouted ""KELLY CLARKSON!!""  and fell back into my seat.  I shoved a spoonful into my boyfriend's mouth while he was playing Candy crush and the game shouted ""SUGAR CRUSH!"" instantly. Then a crumb dropped on the ground and my cat ate it and started shouting it's own name repeatedly, you know, like pokemon.  Basically I'm just trying to say, it was amazing. Because it was.

Located in the Fremont East area, a block or so from Container Park, the outside is inviting just by the shear whimsical flair of the neon monkey sign and brightly colored flowerpots lining the walls as you enter and finally the traditional Virgin Mary of Guadalupe statue.  
Inside is equally thoughtful in the Mexican design.  The bar area, stocked full of different tequilas  (and other liquors and beers) is adorned with rustic wooden and stained glass cathedral pieces. The walls with weathered wallpaper and tons of rosaries surround wooden tables with a mish-mash of Mexican style chairs and benches. A+ in decor. 
Food, it's good, but not fantastic. The chips and salsa they provide are very good, the guac is also very good. However, the other dishes we've ordered are not so fabulous. The pozole was decent in flavor, and quite a bit of chili was added to bring more flavor. The burrito was commented to be good, but nothing spellbinding. The chicken fajitas were definitely tasty, but I was disappointed that they seemed warmed and served on a regular plate. Traditionally, Tex-Mex fajitas are usually served sizzling and steaming hot. The chicken tacos have some strange green guac-salsa verde that is not very appetizing. If we go again I will ask for no green salsa on top of the tacos. The house margarita was very tasty, though! I like how they serve it in a mason jar, keeping with the artsy-rustic feel.

Upon arriving we sat ourselves as the sign said and our bus boy/ drink runner came to the table right away to get the drink order and drop the menus..

Our waiter showed up minutes later and told us the specials.

I chose the calamari, side salad and fish and chips as the menu said it is a guest favorite.

The salad was a good size and very fresh. The calamari seemed very overcooked and a small portion for the price. Maybe it was a new chef? Also, I ordered a side of tartar sauce that never came. The pesto aioli was good but not the same. Also they do not give you lemon wedges with this dish.
The fish and chips came with steak fries that were super hot and really good. The fish also had some burned spots that were not so good. I ended up only taking the leftover fries home. 
My companion said that their chicken parmesan was good but the noodles were really short.

And I learned another reason--I am completely freaked out by blood, especially the idea and action of someone taking blood from me.  If you go, and see Tony, shake his hand, because he had to put up with a lot from me.  (I quickly learned that I need to be lying down, and that I will hyperventilate and collapse into hysteria... for about 10 minutes).

So yeah, if you want somewhere clean, professional, not pretentious and yet still pretty cool... Allcare is highly recommended (at least by me).

On a side note, I plan on transferring my primary care to Dr. Gerace as soon as I get un-lazy enough.",2009-01-16 20:01:00

The community is gated at night which makes me feel a little safer that people can't drive in while I'm sleeping. Someone broke into a bunch of cars in parking lot at my last apartment while we all slept. The apartment is very nice and I have an older model that is not upgraded. When we were doing a credit check and lease Angela was so kind and helpful making our move much easier than it could have been. If you need maintenance you can put in a request on the App and they show up usually by the very next day. The maintenance guys are very nice, down to earth but still professional, we always enjoy being home when they stop by to fix something. I am never made to feel like a bother when I call in and I love that my apartment came ready with security system to protect my home. There's lots of side walk area throughout to take walks and the trees make it feel like a community not a shoe box apartment property. The only thing I'm not totally happy about is the parking. We have one reserved spot and all opens spots are first come first serve. Sometimes we have to park half way across the complex when we get home at night with the 2nd car. I have seen that someone has been parking 4 company cars at a time in parking lot with big huge noticeable decals on side. So I wish they were more strict about those rules or provided 2 reserved spots per apartment.

ps79_Zvusbum_EtrOXFJ4w,r98FaAOAoJDCPp384XpcYA,KTPRYqiFdLowAUEAnN7e3g,4,1,0,2,"Wow, we finally got to try out this gourmet burger craze!  What an experience!

We went to Burgatory for a friend's birthday.  First things first, they don't take reservations, and if you go on the weekend, it is CROWDED.  We had a big group, so they told us to get there around 5:30, which we did, so we were able to get a table together.

The good news is, if you get there early, you get to take advantage of happy hour!  There are discounts on booze and appetizers up until 6pm, so hold off on putting your burger order in until you've had a snack first.

We got the nachos, which were huge and slightly overwhelming.  If I had to do it again, I'd ask for the chili on the side, because it kind of made the chips lose their crunch along the way.  But the flavor of the chili and guac was really good, and it was just the sogginess of the chips that took away from the dish.

When it comes to ordering your burger, you can choose from a number of pre-determined options on the menu, or you can do a 'build your own' from these sheets at the table.  You choose from a checklist the type of burger (and they've got a wide variety, from beef to chicken to veggie or crab), the type of 'rub', type of bun, and then pick from a list of cheeses, condiments, and toppings (some of which are free, and some of which cost).  Finally, you check off how you'd like to have the burger cooked, hand it over to your waiter, and anticipate the arrival of your burgerly beast.

I got a beef burger (hormone-free, woo woo) with mozzarella cheese, garlic mayo, onion straws, chives, and grilled mushrooms.  It was gigantic and delicious and pretty much the most perfect burger of recent memory.  All burgers come with a side of homemade seasoned potato chips, which were delicious as well.

The burger will be huge, so get ready for it.  After dinner, if you've got any room left, feel free to enjoy one of their many creative milkshakes.  As we had a birthday at the table, they sent over a birthday cake milkshake, which we passed around for everyone to sample.  It really tasted like birthday cake!  They also have a selection of 'adult' milkshakes with alcohol in them, but after my happy hour margarita, I was trying to stave off a food coma and stay awake!

Overall, the only thing we didn't like about Burgatory was the other patrons.  Yes, we were a large group, but we'd called ahead and done the process as the staff recommended, and we weren't just sitting around taking up tables after we were done eating.  Despite this, two middle-aged guys with attitudes thought it was appropriate to ask us questions like, ""When the f*ck are you guys going to leave your table?""  So, you poor Burgatory servers, I assume you must have to put up with a parade of douchebags on a regular basis.  It was REALLY crowded, but we weren't the only large party there, and although our server made us feel super welcome, I felt a little awkward with some of the other customers.

So, that said, get there early, and plan to eat fast, if you don't want people eyeing you up the whole night :)  However, these burgers were meant to be savored, and it's probably worth a staredown from a jealous hungry  dude in order to make your burger last as long as you can.

Prices are quite reasonable: for two drinks, an appetizer, and two burgers, we paid less than $40.  I also can't say enough good things about how attentive and accurate our server was, attending to a table of 8 guests, plus his other parties.",2011-05-10 03:36:12

Recently I had a chance to eat some of the food so it's time to chime in on the full experience.  I love the creativity of the place.  Crazy promotions like, Fish races on Thursdays, shirtless shots at 1, wearing sombreros for discounted tacos and other similar wacky ideas make the atmosphere fun.The prices are reasonable and they always have great specials.

Recently I had the Spanking Monkey Sauce, Grilled.  A combo of the BBQ and Buffalo sauce combined.  Very Good.  I have also had the Tacos, Although they are very generous with the taco meat, filling the shell more than halfway to the top. The taco meat itself was only average. 

Another thing that was unfortunate for me and I am sure it was an isolated incident, but recently when I was there the service was below average.

I don't understand why their tables are so high. I mean I'm 5'3"" I get it--I'm not tall but when I sit in their booth the table is like at my chin.  I can't even imagine what little kids have to deal with. I almost asked for a booster chair if I would've thought my butt would've fit in it [should've tried anyhow]. Strike 1

When we originally sat down it kinda smelled like cat pee, so we asked for another booth by the window-it was THAT bad, that one smelt much better; however, I was still chin deep in table.  Not the most comfortable way to eat lunch. Strike 2

I asked if they had a calorie menu so that I could at least try to eat healthy, they did not. Strike 3 next batter.

Our waiter was a little behind so another guy came over to take our drink orders. By the time he was done our waiter came over and took our order but basically asked all the same questions twice. So that was kind of annoying but we made it happen.

What saved this place today [otherwise the stars would be much lower] was the food. I got the chicken tortilla soup [no tortilla strips-extra limes] and the fish tacos, ancho cream sauce on the side.

to approx $32-35 + tip each time for 2 people and we were both full. Plus we got tea and lots of frequent refills (unlimited it seemed).

This is our first time here and we are booked for 5 nights. This location is the same apartment style as the one in San Diego but has a different decor and the building is older. Normally we stay in a one bedroom in SD but none were available so we took the 2 bedroom. The price is excellent and we have our dogs with us for a flat rate of $75 which is chump change compared to other hotels that charge and additional $35 a night. My two sons have their own room and bathroom, the hotel offered complimentary travel crib for my 1 year old daughter, and they even have treats out for our pups. The staff was very friendly, the eating area was nicely laid out with plenty of indoor space. There is a nice pool which I think is salt water and a little nook with a fire pit and grill. There is plenty of trees and tall hedges for privacy and shade and so far it's been nice and quiet. Now understandably this is old town and people party so I'll update in a few days once we've experienced a Friday and Saturday night. As for the food, it's exactly the same as the location in SD with well balanced and delicious options. There are even ""to go"" boxes to take meals to the room if you'd rather eat there. There is a nice bar area as well that we are going to try out today.

The first time we were here, the cashier didn't really speak English. I wanted to order a hot grass jelly and she told me it was ""burning"". I wasn't sure what she meant so we went for the cold instead. We ordered a Meet Fresh signature and a #4. We were given a beeper and was told to go upstairs. We waited around 15 minutes for the food to be ready. Would've expected it to come quicker as everything is pretty much premade.

The grass jelly was very smooth and not too hard. I was quite surprised that there was ice on the bottom of the grass jelly. I would've preferred it if there was less ice or none at all as it made the grass jelly very watery. The sweet potato/taro balls are basically a chewy glutinous rice ball with pretty much no flavour. Not a fan of them. 

The second time we decided to give the hot grass jelly a try. We ordered a #4 grass jelly again but substituted tapioca and taro/sweet potato balls with mung beans and peanuts. We also tried the tofu pudding in almond soup.

I finally know why the cashier told us the hot grass jelly would be ""burning"". Rather than firm grass jelly, when you order it hot, it is almost completely liquid. To better describe it, the grass jelly was all melted. After a while it became more slimy. If they offer hot grass jelly, they should make a firmer variation suitable of serving it hot. They used the same grass jelly as the cold one. From my pictures, you can clearly see all the toppings have sunk as it wasn't firm enough to hold up the toppings.

The tofu pudding in almond soup wasn't bad, but the tofu pudding wasn't smooth enough. It was also a little too firm for my liking. I liked the almond soup. On its own it's pretty sweet, but since the tofu pudding was pretty much unsweetened, the combination was great.",2018-05-25 00:16:48

Reviews emphasize the pizza but they have one of those menus with a little bit of everything from burgers to salads to wings and sandwiches, and even pastas.

Ordered takeout a couple times: first order of a salad and grilled cheese was dismal, with large, rough-cut veggies in the salad and unmelted cheese on the sandwich. But there was tons of chicken on the salad and their prices are reasonable.

Returned for the pizza, specifying half Spinach and Feta and half Philly Steak. Happily, they were able to accommodate this though they later told me they typically don't do half styles. The pie was loaded up with toppings and both sides were tasty enough to make it difficult to pick a favorite. However, the crust was somewhat soggy in the middle, which I didn't care for.

Staff have been friendly and the location is clean. I'll likely be ordering again (specifically the eggplant parm sandwich!) because they're quick, cheap, and convenient.

The bread basket was fantastic (as is most). There is Epi Baguette, Sourdough, Pretzel, and Cheese Crisp Crostini. The baguette had that wonderful chewy, moist interior, crusty exterior, and a great distinctive flavor.

We started with Fried Calamari ($15) and it's served a little differently now. They drizzle the spicy garlic aïoli over the calamari and it's served with a sweet chili dipping sauce along with the usual fresh lemon. I thought it would be too much with the aïoli and the chili sauce, but they really complemented each other (though you do need acidity from the fresh lemon juice to cut through the creaminess and sweetness). I would prefer the calamari to not be pre-sauced, but it was still tasty.

The 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye ($59) was decent; it was cooked a tad over our request of medium rare and though it had nice strips of fat around the edges, the cut lacked a lot of marbling. It was still tender and mostly flavorful, so we enjoyed it.

I really liked the cut and size of their Chilean Sea Bass ($51) and it was good, but it didn't have that super buttery texture that I've come to associate with this fish. It was a little disappointing and I'm not sure what attributed to its non-characteristic texture; perhaps overcooked?

As it as been said many times, the Lobster Mashed Potatoes ($38) is absolutely divine! The super creamy potatoes are combined with large pieces of fresh Maine Lobster and finished with a pool of butter. It actually looks more like a buttery lobster broth, but I guess it's just lots and lots of butter! Either way, it's obviously delicious.

Not something we would normally order, I was pleased with the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi ($34). The chewy, pillowy gnocchi is tossed in a asiago alfredo sauce and finished with black truffle and King Crab. All of these flavors worked together nicely and nothing was particularly overwhelming or too heavy.

Lastly, we ordered Sautéed Broccoli ($13). I was surprised how little it was sautéed, however, it was crunchy and a perfect accompaniment to the rich potato dishes and steak.

Since we were here for my birthday, they brought out a complimentary slice of their Triple Chocolate Layer Cake (I believe it's half). Not typically a chocolate cake fan, I loved it! The cake was really moist, wonderful mousse, and I loved the crunchy chocolate shavings and fresh raspberries. It's also served with a mountain of their wonderful fresh whipped cream (there was so much, we thought it was ice cream!).

From the moment we stepped into the restaurant to the very end, service was phenomenal! We were tended to by so many individuals and everyone was on top of their game. Everyone helped each other and we never had a moment of need.

The prices are mid- to high, but the portions are very generous! I assume most people leave with bags (we walked out with a large one as our food would've been enough for 3-4 people). Overall, we had a really wonderful experience and the food was good (above average).",2017-09-16 08:13:31

I was a little concerned driving in because parking is limited to a small lot behind the building (half of which are reserved for apartment owners and other businesses) and the street spots, while free, were being utilized for an ""Antique Car Show Sunday"" Show. But, I arrived just before 9am and by 10am, those cars were cleared. And on the plus side, all this parking is FREE.

Between the time we got a table to when we actually received some service must have been 10 minutes, which would have been longer if we hadn't waved down a server and made a face of frustration a couple of times. 
Prices were on the high side and as for the decor, they made it pretty high-endish with private rooms, each consisting of around 2-3 tables.
I asked for the chirashi bowl and a friend got the soba noodles. The food took a pretty long time to make, around 20 minutes! While waiting they served us some complimentary seafood broth soup with crispy noodles, which was quite flavourful. Once the food arrived I was in shock by the size of the chirashi. I've never seen such a huge serving of that dish before, where I think it could be good enough for 2 people. However my friends soba noodles were a an average size, a bit too small for my appetite. As for me, I had to remove some of my rice but managed to finish all of the sashimi. I did however find that my meal was a bit bland compared to others that I've had. 
One thing I did appreciate was that when I asked them to add extra ginger into my meal, they definitely obliged and piled it on!
I didn't really get much of a reaction from the soba noodles, other than that they were fine and nothing exceptional.

I have been to their drum circle events at the Club Aruba. There are a lot of ""spiritual"" and sometimes off the wall hippies that roams around and dance to their inner spirits. Entertaining but sometimes a little too much, but appreciatively fun!

My favorite which this review only applies to is....swing dancing! Yes!!  
Before, I never experienced swing dancing until one night after getting tired of seeing all of the drum circle chanting and everyone just being so freely spiritual....so we went to the next lounge called the Thunderbird Lounge in the Aruba and there we found awesome 50's music and people swing dancing to the tunes.  

I love to dance but I don't like dancing with others because I don't like to be touched. Watching the swing dancers looked so amazing and fun.  After smiling and watching to a few songs, I noticed an overweight older man in his 60's get up from his table where he sat by himself and walked towards my way.  I was a little petrified, but he respectfully came up to me and was such a gentleman and said, ""Lady, may I have this dance?"" I felt like I was in the 50's and very timid! I told him that I do not know how to swing dance at all. He assured me that it was okay and he will teach me. So, I trusted his sense of kindness, respect and danced with the fellow.

WOW!!! I had one of the best times of my life dancing. He taught me and I just went with it. I messed up a little but it was so fun and although there was physical contact; I did not feel uncomfortable or groped at all which was great! It was pure dancing in a non sexual way and all in fun! Then, people would switch partners in the midst of the song which was really interesting! Again, none of the gentlemen that I danced with that night made me feel uncomfortable at all.

The best thing which I have to try is that on Fridays and Sundays at 6pm, they have FREE swing dancing lessons for 2 hours and the rest of the evening is just PURE and FUN swing dancing!

(If I could JUST get this great food, but served up by the hardened service veterans down the street at the Chateau d'Oeuf, with God as my witness, I would never make my own brekkers again.)

24 April 2010 Update
Returned for lunch.  Same deal:  food was so wonderful, time from ordering to table WORSE.  Now, come on.  Seven tables, two servers, three in the kitchen, simple orders.  Let's say I had to get back to work, and had an hour.  Ten minutes there, ten back, we're down to forty minutes.  I'd like a half hour for eating, chatting, complaining about Goldman Sachs' Culture of Greed.  You make me wait a half hour for food, I'll never come back, no matter HOW much I like the grub.  Okay?  (Back to two stars.  And I WANT to love you.  I really do.)",2010-04-11 14:53:20

So it has been about 10 years since I last purchased a vehicle.  I have had 2 Nissans, 2 Acuras, and none Toyota/Lexus that I want to give it a try.  So I stopped by Bell Lexus North Scottsdale right down the street from my house.  I thought since this dealership moved from Phoenix to Scottsdale, their attitudes would be better and have higher quality of service, oh, was I totally wrong about this.

To begin the whole process, I've been in communication with one of their customer service rep over the Internet about what I want in my car, we kept writing e-mails back and forth to each other with the changes and exactly what I'm looking for.  One day on my day off, I stopped by the dealership for the first time.  There wasn't many people looking in their lot, one of the sales rep came out and I told him I was looking for a gal which would remain nameless because it's not important in this case.

Then this gal introduced me to the product specialist that serves as sales rep as well.  He went through everything with me, trying to find me the color that I had previous talked to this gal about, and then he told me, I'm sorry, but the car you want is no longer available to you.  So I asked to see another similar vehicle and asked for a test drive.  He said he'll drive the car off the lot and let me drive the rest of the way.  I thought he meant he'll just drive the car out of the dealership and park it at the near-by street for me to take over.  No, he drove the car for like 5 minutes and about 2 miles away from the dealership before letting me take control of the vehicle.  What type of test drive was that?  Is he afraid that I might wrack the car or he is not sure if I know how to handle a Lexus?

Back to the dealership after the worst test drive ever, we sat down to talk numbers.  He talked to his manager while I sat at his desk waiting for him.  He would not give me the final cost on how much I would need to pay, instead, he asked for $3,000 to locate the car that I requested with the gal earlier from another dealership.  Seriously, why the heck do you think I would give you $3,000 to locate the car for me when you can't even give me the final number on the car.  You can't be serious.  That's not how you want people to buy car from you.  Instead I think they are driving people away from their dealership since people are very afraid to go shop there.

I have purchased the vehicle I want from Earnhardt Scottsdale Lexus.

Seriously people, STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP.",2014-04-07 08:11:22

I was first excited to learn of Solon being a Market District site, figuring they'd first go with the new Broadview Heights store.  During construction I figured there's no way they'll have the floor space for anything close to what they have at Robinson in Pittsburgh and I was correct.  They lack in space, product offerings, quality, customer service and technology.

They don't offer anything at a discount compared to others, and they don't offer anything truly unique that you couldn't get elsewhere...so why bother?  Unless of course you're a huge fan of frozen baked goods made in Pittsburgh, trucked to Solon, and finished to appear as if this was point of origin.

This store will have to appeal to a certain kind of consumer to survive.  They're 24-hrs now, but expect them to close at midnight at some point or scale back hours significantly. Anyone that knows Solon, or Cleveland for that matter knows that 24-hr locations do not do well here.

My grandmother hates the new place, says it's too big.  So they've alienated their loyal locals, and they've alienated anyone that's experienced the true Market District store at Robinson, PA, by not being big enough.  Here's a perfect opportunity for Marc's, Heinen's, Miles Farmers Market, and WalMart to grab precious market share.

I think it's yet again where the Cleveland version of a franchise gets the shaft.

Right now the place is crowded.  Expect to wait for counter service as they lack a number calling system or even a stantion for some order to queue up.

Parking's a nightmare too.",2013-09-17 16:07:39

When I got into the theater there was a woman sitting in my seat when I asked her to move she told be someone was sitting in her seat so she sat in mine and would not move. So I left to get a ticket to the next 11:30 am showing. The staff did offer to have the person move however I felt that would be more disruptive so I just changed my ticket. After I walked away from the desk one of the staff members did approach me and offer a free popcorn voucher which was a nice gesture.  When 11:10 came I got my concession items and headed to the 11:30 showing in theater 8 and got settled, and everything was going great until about 11:52 am then the screen goes black while the movies audio track continued to play. At 11:56 am I got up to find out if the staff knew of the issue. They informed me that the entire suite of theaters 6-14 all had blacked out screens and that they were going to attempt to reset the movie. At this point I had already had a poor experience with the new Camelview location so I just wanted my refund and was ready to go on to my next task for the day. I know that things happen but for a $14 charge for a show before noon I expect better. And I was no longer in the mood to watch the film.

We showed up around 12 or so on April First Friday.

Parking is a disaster here too. Hello Shasta. Lots of people park anywhere else BUT the Vig lot. At least you don't have to park across the street, just next door.

The door guy does not really check ID's. He just looked at us & waved us in.

The architecture is cool. It's open & the ceiling is tall. It's not as cramped. Lots of gray, concrete, rust colored metal, & some wooden accents. So, the inside is ok. Better than the other Vig.

Put up a clear, easy to read sign pointing to where the restrooms are! Do it NOW. Everyone wants to walk back to where the kitchen is. Nope, restrooms are right where the patio starts in the back on the left.

The patio sucks. It's more like an extension of the inside. Not as lounge-like as the other Vig. It's closed in with tons of glass & block. It's freaking LOUD out there. Everything reverberates. Not good. Only awesome thing is the fireplace. More people can sit around it & it's really cool looking.

The servers pay attention to you here! Are there more of them at this location? I saw our server tons of times & she checked on us at least 5 times, maybe more. That's great!

I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich. I didn't know you could mess 1 of those up. The bread is HUGE & fluffy. I could barely taste the cheese past all that bread. Saving part about that meal are their fries.

- Moscow Mule was yum :)
- Glass of Next: Pinot Nior was very good.
- Trout Slayer on tap! My friend has property in Missoula Montana & was a little surprised it was on tap here. This was my first time trying it. I don't normally like beer. I'm picky with beer. This stuff is GOOD! Who knew I'd like a beer with a fishy fruity flavor lol.
- Tic Tac the bartender gave me when I asked for a recommendation was gross. 1. No one orders those. 2. That wasn't made correctly. Thankfully he didn't charge us since I hated it.

The people who were there are a lot more casual. Older crowd too. Not nearly as attractive as the people at the other Vig. Sorry, but it's true. I watched 1 woman who was so drunk she nodded off in her chair.

The duck was very good.  I loved the panang curry.  I thought it was spicier than medium but these things are subjective.  I would order mild next time.  The portion was very good.  The duck was as tender as I have ever had in this dish.  It melted in your mouth.  I think there was a coating to it or something that didn't really stand up very well in the sauce.

After my first appointment - at that time to be my last appointment - he doggedly tried to contact me to make the first appointment right.  Emilio and I had quite a lengthly and productive conversation.  He cares very much about making the customer happy AND correcting the situation that was unsatisfactory.  

I did go back and was very pleased with my cut once again.  Because Marshall was running late (20 minutes and counting) Caesar cut my hair this time.  Another great cut!

Again, however, the desk needs training in customer service.  After a 20 minute wait, the receptionist still hadn't notified Marshall that I was there.

Bought a new RIA 1911 here the day after Christmas. I didn't dink around wanting to see and touch everything in the shop; I knew what I wanted and didn't waste time. Did the paperwork, paid cash, out the door in less than an hour.

Except that the gun was assembled with incorrect parts, making it impossible to take down for cleaning. I took it back it the next day and asked them to confirm that I'm not an idiot. They said they'd send it back to Armscor for repair. They didn't say that they were going to sit on the gun for two weeks before sending it back. ""We had to wait for authorization from Armscor."" Funny, when I called Armscor for a status check that same day, they didn't say a word about that to me.

A moderator sends my complaint to Ivan and Gene at Armscor, who immediately jump on the problem and fix my gun, admitting that their QA had screwed the pooch. They shipped it back last Wednesday (side rant: according to UPS, Wednesday + 2nd Day Air = Monday). It arrived this morning. Having worked for an FFL, I know exactly what's involved in processing incoming and outgoing firearms, so I gave AZ Firearms three hours before I pinged them.

""We have a shop full of people. We're working on the incomings and we'll call you when it's ready!""

It's now 1715 and they close in 45 minutes.

Every gun shop in the entire US has had a shop full of people every day since November 2008, so don't give me that excuse. Logging the incomings, unless you're talking about shipping levels on par with SHOT, doesn't take all damn day. If it does, you need to hire more help and/or streamline your process. What you don't do is tell your customers that you're too busy to deal with their piddly-ass warranty work.",2013-02-05 00:21:05

This restaurant is pretty much a carbon copy of Chipotle (2 of the employees on duty actually worked at my former Chipotle of choice).  I had a chicken burrito (my Chipotle norm) so I could make as direct of a comparison as possible.  

The food was great, and afterwards I didn't get that ""punched in the stomach"" feeling that Chipotle gives me for some time after I eat it (I am convinced their rice expands in your stomach, but it tastes good so I suffer through it).  

I also picked up their frequent customer swipe card (buy 10 burritos get one free + free chips and salsa after activation).  This place is closer to my place than any Chipotle, so I will be coming very often!

I got the Bear Hug on sourdough and she got the Thunderbird on the dutch-crunch. The Thunderbird comes with thunderbird sauce. It is so good, you could taste all the parts; pastrami, gouda, & thunderbird sauce. The thunderbird sauce has a little kick to it, which is why I prefer it. And now let us discuss the dutch-crunch bread, it is a little sweet so the thunderbird sauce goes on that sandwich in perfect harmony. 

Then we get to my sandwich. :-( The sourdough was great and I am sure the dirry-sauce is good (I had already got blown away by the thunderbird sauce) but the sandwich has way to much going on in it. Roast beef, jalapeno poppers, lettuce, & some other yummy stuff in there I can't even remember. 

Because they will pretty much make any kind of sandwich you want, I want to try meatball, gouda, lettuce, with thunderbird sauce on dutch-crunch bread. I believe it will be ""out of this world"". In fact Ike, here's a new sandwich and title for you.

One sandwich can pretty much fill two normal appetites up. Unless you are like me, a ravenous creature. Get one and share ot get one for two-three meals.

We were called for our table upstairs, and asked if we wanted Bob to come by, which he did, which was a really nice touch. 

We had two cocktails each, that weren't really great. Sure they aren't a $9 vodka, but I didn't really think they were all-that.

The panang had notes of sweetness balanced with just enough heat to make it fun but not so much that I couldn't enjoy it. The veggies in both were fresh and crisp - not over cooked.

We were told the wait would be 15 minutes so we sat at the bar for a drink. The bartender was friendly and the drink came out promptly. Lots of TVs made it easy to catch a game or the UFC fight if we wanted. As we continue to wait 20 minutes went by and still no one came to get us for our seat we waiting additional five minutes before going to the hostess desk and as were walking up with the manager said ""oh there you are we will go ahead and place you in your seat now.""
It's funny that they didn't know where we were when the hostess was the one who set us at the bar. Anyway, we sat down and looked at the menu we ended up ordering within two minutes of seating. Our drinks came out and after another 20 minutes of waiting we still haven't gotten our meals. The waitress came about and said I'm so sorry but I threw away your ticket can you remind me of what it was that you ordered sir. My husband explain that he wanted the nachos and inquired how if she threw away the ticket my Caesar salad had arrived. She said should probably work on getting our food out. We waited about another 30 minutes before meal finally came. The problem with was that two other tables got seated after us and receive their drinks in their food in their entirety before we did. We didn't complain considering we were just there for a chill laid-back dinner but in general that's not good service.

Now it's crunch time. Now it's time to see if the food is worth the money!

There was literally nothing in those fajitas that were Yum worthy. I got bored with my food and start eating my husband's nachos and again nothing spectacular.

I have always struggled with in grown toe nails. Eve giave me tips on how to care for it and she is also an amazing nail artist.

I do like the ambiance of the restaurant and the service typically seems to be fine, but for the price I'd rather go to another one of the more expensive places that Phoenix/Scottsdale has to offer, even in the Kierland Commons area. 

I have eaten here probably 3 or 4 times and never been blown away by anything I have had. My main issue with some of the seafood dishes is that there is too much added flavor (sauces, etc).

Walked in to the joint and it was super busy like packed. Everyone in there looked like they had been swimming all day...hot pink faces, raccoon eyes, and that I'm so hungry I could I eat my hand look of hunger. Wile in line we were able to watch the tortilla ladies work their magic. Um SBL and I watched the tortillas spin like a record player and instantly felt like we had gone on too many rides at the fair. Kudos to those chicks who work that crazy invention on a daily basis, gesh! 
Ordering at Cafe Rio makes you understand what a traffic cop feels like when he blows his whistle and holds his hands up. It's loud in there and there is so much going on down the line it's amazing they can even focus. 
SBL ordered the taco chicken salad and I ordered the sweet pork quesadilla, oh momma!! That sweet pork measures so good it's on the stupid meter. I love it, and we get each other. SBL wondered why all the lettuce and everything else had to be placed on the top. I said because it looks pretty, but I'm sure there's some science behind it.
In line there was so many orders being filled at once, our food turned into keep your eye on the white ball under the cup game. We lost Mini Mi's quesadilla a couple times, but it always found its way back to us. 
We finally made it to the register and upon checkout we were pretty sure they didn't charge us for everything, but honestly we couldn't tell you what they missed because it was so dang hectic in there. We were so glad to walk out the door. Not all Cafe Rio's are created equal I guess. 
The food was super tasty as always, not sure SBL was sold tho.

Rachel suggested Caffe Mona for a brunchy kinda get-together, and due to the establishment's hours, it made for a perfect Sunday afternoon fit. 

As I write this, my dilemma is whether or not to give Caffe Mona a 3 or a 4.

First off, the service, while friendly, was somewhat flighty. Our server brought us a dish that none of us had ordered, and at the end of our meal, mixed up our split checks. 

Secondly, the food seemed to be just a scintilla astray. 

Acting as a starter was a tastefully simple plate of freshly cut fruit. Granny Smith Apples, pears, and watermelon triangles did wonders for my produce cravings of late. The watermelon in particular was gushingly ice-cold and made for ideal, wholesome snack. 

My minor issues with the food began with my breakfast entree. The Potato Scramble, a dineresque ""garbage-style"" jumble of cubed tubers, Applewood bacon strips, Roma tomatoes, and Swiss cheese filled my stomach but failed to excite me much. An online search indicates a bit of controversy over whether or not to season scrambled eggs, but in this case, I felt a pinch of salt and a crank of the pepper mill would have lifted this dish from mildly palatable to positively epicurean. The textural admix of light/fluffy/crispy/chunky/creamy/gooey was bold while the flavors were a little shy. 

Desiring a dessert of some kind, I also had an Oreo Crepe, which was supposed to contain within an ""Oreo-infused"" blanket both Oreo fragments and marshmallow. The crepe itself somewhat resembled a gourmet Pop-Tart in appearance, toasty taste, and mouthfeel and didn't seem to have any Oreo origins to speak of. The filling did have an Oreo gravel inside it but seemingly lacked the marshmallow, making the crepe far more timid than the decadent mess of a treat I expected. I did enjoy it but not as much as I thought I would. 

So, perhaps a 3 is appropriate after all. Mona's got the looks with her modern, brick-and-wood-laden decor and welcome-to-my-new-loft ambience but could use some fine-tuning in terms of service and culinary technique. 

P.S. All of us had a pleasant, chatty time together despite the uneven dining experience.",2012-07-03 02:28:53

The food was AMAZING! For our appetizer, we got the baked garlic shrimp. Despite this dish being delicious, I felt like the bowl they used to make this dish was bad. It was pretty hard to take out the shrimp and as it was small there was hardly anything in there, so you can say it's not worth the price. However, the steak here is to die for! I got the teriyaki sirloin with mashed potatoes and vegetables. It was delicious!! I love coming to The Keg for steak. 

Our service was not so great. Despite our waitress being kind, she hardly checked up on us. Also, whenever we needed something, we had to call someone over to call her because she wasn't coming towards us.

Overall, I would return if I'm in the area! If there is a special event, you will want to come celebrate here. A bit on the pricy side, but it's worth it.",2018-01-03 00:18:20

They have two different areas, I only ever been in the front and yet the back looks big big and well, rock out, jk.

+ get their before 8pm and get in free and then they have half off drinks for a bit, so cool, way to save and still get your drink on and dance on; I think that's a great deal

+ two bar areas and people that walk around with shots $1-$5, a shot?.

+they have an outside area, where you can smoke and get some freash air, 
-no out side sitting.

+ have a big dance floor that has bar sitting around it and you can get on the dance floor with ease, as I think they have a while chair rape for 1one of their dance floor entrances

- -they do have a dress code, as it is a theme of Cowboys and around the western feel, so if you plan on wearing something sliveless and be a guy, you will be asked to leave or put on the jacket that made you feel like you are going to pass out; simply, it maybe sexist or kinda like WTF, and still, it's all part of the DND way, so if going got to be more streamlined for the whole back in the day...so they could be more open, and still a Coybow themed place.

/ the CS, it can be great and yet a little spacey, lol, kinda their to help and yet, their is a lot of drink making and liquid fun being ordered; so it has a lot to do with how bizzy and I think simply, it almost seems like the more you spend the more you get helped. Over all, other then that, they do CS, with a smile and well, it's kinda a means of what can happen at any bar, as I never been a service in a bar area so, the is a means of first come, kinda thing.

+they do, beer pong tournaments and have some kinda event going on that sure to be a DND delight and you are bound to have a fun time, plus, even if you want to just hang with friends they have pool tables and well, even when it gets popping their is always a sit some where. 

+ even a great place to have a birthday party, as I dont know what kind of means they have to a Happy Birthday and yet host or not; you will still be able to have your cake and dance it off the same day, lol.

+ the people that go their, are fun dn well, it's has such a culture to it that really, you will soon become part of the DND family and just start leaving your stuff as to watch your table and it will still be yours

Tip = when planing on dancing, make sure you dress in away that you walk out with what you walk in with; as I, been dancing and lost a necklace before; well, enjoy who ever got it and whipped to see if it was mine well, you got your answer, through silence. Lol

@over all, it is a fun place to go and dance and have a great time, as they have the able and they do to be a cowboy theme tell it gets latter and they start seeming like a club; as more cowboy in their early means of opening and then they, later on, when all the party animals come out to play, it will start getting a bit less country and a bit more rock n roll, lol

Simply, they are a well, worth it place to go and hang, dance and have a great time doing it

Tip = right by the Wok in, so they got great food and a great way to dance

So, this was a no-brainer. Initially, my experience at Tiffany & Co. was leaning toward a solid 3-stars, when the lady who initially offered to help us out had no idea that they carried ID bracelets and then disappeared. Then, the next lady who helped us out was, while very knowledgeable about their catalog, was (at first) rather aloof and almost snobby.

Toward the end of the visit, she started to unwind a bit, cracked a smile and made us feel at ease. I get it. I'm not the warmest person at first meeting myself. So, winning her over was a bit like making friends with your sister's cat that hisses at you from underneath a table. We were later assisted by another lady who was also friendly and funny. When you're dropping stacks, having someone fun to talk to that knows their ish is everything. Otherwise, you start to feel like you're in a fancy Best Buy. 

When I came here a couple of weeks later to pick up the bracelet that I had custom engraved, I was greeted by smiling staff and the lady that got my bracelet for me even helped me to put it on.

Pro tips: For the most part, this Tiffany's is kind of like a warehouse. Any custom work like engraving or resizing is not done in house, at least, not yet. It's sent to their location in Toronto, so if you're shopping for that special someone's present and want to give it to them on their birthday; plan ahead.

Tiffany's silver also is a bit on the soft side, so if you're thinking that maybe you can save yourself the wait time by getting it engraved over at Things Engraved: forget it. Things Engraved refuses all items from Tiffany's full stop, because the machine that they use for engraving has destroyed one bracelet too many.

If you're shopping for, say, an engagement ring, but you don't want to support the terrible Blood Diamond industry; Tiffany & Co. owns their diamond mines to ensure that all of their diamonds are conflict-free. While this may make the diamonds you purchase slightly more princely, you can be safe in the knowledge that no one was murdered or mutilated for your bling.

We sat at the bar and had awesome service. Nice, attentive, knowledgeable and visibly working hard. I ordered the fruity margarita and it was pretty good, nothing wrong with it but I generally don't do sweet... my own fault. My husband ordered the flight of bourbon... good choice. He LOVED them, was really happy with the quality. 

Food- we ordered two apps to share and that's it. We ordered the Sticky Ribs and Potatoes. Um I am still thinking about those sticky ribs. They were absolutely my favorite.. I almost liked the bowl. The flavors were spot on to my taste buds. Potatoes were also on point. They also served some complimentary bread with a special spread.... I never wanted the basket to end :)

The dressing is SO good, it has a slight sweetness to it and its thicker than just regular balsamic.  The bread is good, the grilled veggies are great, the whole dish is just fantastic :)

This time I decided to try something different and I got the Tre colore pasta (fusilli tossed with grilled chicken, roasted red peppers, and asparagus in a basil pesto cream sauce).

The food was good but I've had better Spanish food/tapas elsewhere. We started off with the Mixta Iberico (Iberian sausage, chorizo and ham platter). I really wanted the Iberian ham... it's similar to prosciutto. It was good but I've had it better elsewhere. For example, the one at Bocata in the old port is delicious!!  The chorizo and sausage were nothing special. We ate the cold cuts with Coca con Tomate (coca bread - tomato - olive oil). It's basically a baguette cut up with olive oil and the juice of a fresh tomato. Normally I wouldn't order something so simple but the waitress recommended. It really filled us up and helped us coat our stomachs for all the alcohol to come so I guess it was a good idea. We had the Pinxo de Cordero Alhucemas (Quebec lamb brochette). It was so good! I loved the spice and how tender it was. I wish there had been more than one brochette. We also had the Mc Foie - Burger which was also very tasty. t was basically a hamburger with a sesame seed bun, beef patty, onion, and foie gras. They put the foie gras on the side and it was a good size. The burger itself was smaller than a regular hamburger but slightly bigger than a slider. To accompany the burger we got the las Bravas (triple cooked fries - aioli - brava sauce). They were thick rectangular fries... nothing special. I tried my friends Bikini de ""Carles Abellan Tramezzini. This was so yummy! Its basically a grilled cheese with Iberian ham,mozzarella di buffala, and truffles.

It was pretty packed on a Saturday and the music was good. I would come back for drinks and maybe one or two tapas for like a 5 a 7. Go with your colleagues or friends after work! The drinks were good. I want to go back and try their sangria.I tried the French Canadian Bloody Caesar which was made up of Gin Piger Henricus, clamato, lemon, and rimmed with steak spice. It's not often that I see a bloody Caesar with gin. Gin is my drink of choice so i was excited to try it and it did not disappoint! I also tried the Peruvian bloody Caesar which was also very good!

My daughter was having some breakouts, and I thought a facial would serve her well.  I immediately became a member because I thought the $59 membership would ""force"" me to get out and do something for myself.  (Although I have not been a stay at home mom for 9 years, I am still accustomed to not spending much money on myself.)

My daughter's face cleared up quickly.  I followed up with some express facials, but eventually I signed her up for monthly facials as well because her skin only stayed clear with consistent facials.  I currently have both daughters (14 and 16) getting monthly facials.  

The place is clean and very welcoming.  I never had regular facials before coming to Fuchsia.  I had one facial at Dolce salon.  It was nice, but I thought the people were snotty.

I later had a second facial and massage at JC Penny salon.  It was also nice.  However, when I went back for my second appointment, I waited for 20 minutes before leaving.

So mostly the facials I have had have been at Fuchsia.  From what I remember of the other places, Fuchsia's prices were much better and the quality was better as well.  

Never once did I feel pressured to get memberships for my daughters.  Most of the ladies there do not pressure you to buy products either.  Some of the products are expensive, but Eminence products last a really long time and are worth it.  

We started to get pedicures at Fuchsia to last year after my daughter got an infection in her toe after getting a pedicure at a ""hole in the wall"" place.  The cost for pedicures is a little more at Fuchsia, but the infection on my daughter's foot taught me to not be so cheap in that area.

Fuchsia is a great place, and I am so happy with the service we've gotten.  They're flexible and are great when we have to make a change in appointments due to my daughter's busy school schedules.   

My girls still have some breakouts at times, but regular facials and extractions have really helped their skin and confidence with their appearance.

**After being a member for quite some time, we finally cancelled last summer when we had problems scheduling.  Once the receptionist scheduled us on the day of a big event and when we showed up the day before for facials, manicures, and pedicures, she told me that we were scheduled for the following day.  That happened twice.  Then they could not coordinate three of us together without one of us waiting, so it became a hassle with scheduling.",2012-03-16 21:44:02

Best roll was the blue flame roll. It is very reminiscent of a Las Vegas roll but without the cream cheese. It is not spicy at all despite the warnings. Very heavy roll due to it being fried 3.5/5

Spicy tuna roll is not spicy at all. The fish quality is not very high either. Very forgettable. 3/5

The worst roll is the salmon skin roll. I have ordered this dish from other restaurants before but this is the worst iteration I have ever tasted.

I detest beer, or rather I can't seem to like it no matter how many I try. I prefer and can drink a cider and I'm also not a wine person but oddly I enjoy port wine. Why am I starting out with this is; Wvrst is most likely best enjoyed something akin to an Izakaya, which is beer with fatty, fried, and or salty food to compliment said beverage. 

Since we (my partner and I) do not drink I cannot give a review that would be able to connect with those that can appreciate beer so I apologize if I can't give more than just observations. This place has a wall of taps and a whole menu of exotic canned beers that are divided by colour as if we're wine and by other descriptive words, however I didn't pay too much attention. 

What we came here for was the game meat sausages. I have a lot of confidence that if they got the game meat sausages down that their traditional sausages must be just as amazing. I got the wild boar sausage which is a mix of boar, mushroom, and tea from how the menu describes it. The sausage was topped with onions and sour kraut (although I could not find the onions or taste them). The sausage was well cooked and it was juicy with the delicious animal fat that leaked out as you take a bite. The sausage is well seasoned but is complimented by the tartness of the sour kraut and the horse radish mustard I added. 

My parter got the Merguez, which is lamb and harissa and she got it in the style of currywrst. Which means that the sausage was cooked and cut up for you and served with bread and a tomato curry sauce. Now on the menu in house it just explains the currywvrst as I have and on the online menu it says in parentheses that this style is not recommended with game meats, and that double portions are available. We found that this might be the case because of the strong flavour of the spices in the curry but if the Merguez might be the exception (or at least for us it was). The spices that flavour the lamb in the sausage and the curry seems to remind us of a shakshuka without the egg. The curry is sweet, tart, and taste or the herby spices. 

We also got the pretzel with cheese sauce (made of Raclette and Gouda). The cheese sauce enhances the natural saltiness of the pretzel but doesn't make it too salty unless you eat a bunch of it bite after bite. Again seems like beer would be a good accompaniment but at least we had water. I also found that the accompanying horse radish mustard added another level of complexity to the cheese if you're okay mixing the two sauces. Oh yeah the pretzel is made really well soft in the middle but with enough of a greasy texture to hold up again the cheese and mustard sauces. 

We finished our meal with a salted rosemary and maple soft serve ice cream. Now I couldn't tell or taste any hint of rosemary. The ice cream was a well rounded flavour of maple because of the salt, that almost reminds you or caramel but with the woody earthiness that maple brings. I found it sweeter than my liking but because of the roundedness of the taste I ate more than I normally would. My partner said that the rosemary is very subtle and didn't too sweet but did acknowledge the sweetness. 

This place would get a five star from me but and here are my critiques. The portion sizes are small, in fact when the currywvrst Merguez sausage came out my partner didn't think it would fill her up. It was surprisingly filler (for her) but I would imagine this would not be the case for most people unless you natural have a small stomach or appetite. Despite the really well made sausage I don't know if it's worth the $12 price tag for the game sausages. The same applies to the pretzel with cheese sauce which ran me a little over $7.50. Btw not a pretzel shape. This is not to say the food doesn't warrant the price but it hard for me to see the size worth that price. But I mean it you understand, enjoy, and appreciate the value of really well done small portioned food available at Tapas and Izakaya you should be able to appreciate this. But if you're think I can get a bratwurst or Italian sausage on the street corner one block east for $3-5 than this is going to be a tough sell to your wallet.",2018-05-12 21:58:47

Be honest, who are you going to force into watching you... walk... I mean, I don't like being forced to watch babies take their first steps.  Though now that I think about it, perhaps I'll send this along to the next person that sends me one of those.

If you want a CD of digital pictures for Facebook updates (because lets face it, half the reason we do things is to show them off to others), it's another $16.99.  I think they could've at least given us the option of if we wanted the DVD or CD.

Service was swift and polite.   Knowing Mandarin Chinese or having a friend that knows it woudl help.

Overall, the plating, restaurant decor, and serving amounts appear dated. My recommendation would be for the owners to take a look at the meal's accessories and repackage, smaller portions (actually you could take the existing sides and, without changing them at all, make them 'family style' sides (they really are that big).

I met a friend here for coffee one morning and we sat outside (no misters, at least not that 110-degree day) sweating our bodies off because the indoor seating was super crowded. The place is super hipster, cute as a freaking button and packed. Lots of people on laptops ""working remotely"" and doing what people do during the day at coffee shops. That also meant we were stuck outside, but anyway. 

The iced coffee and my friend's chai tea latte were pretty good, but the nutella croissant wasn't super amazing or anything.

It's not too expensive, costing around $6-7 for a HUGE calzone that can easily be split up into two meals.  The calzones are packed with fresh ingredients, and you can even make your own calzone including up to 5 ingredients of your choice (more at an extra cost).  

Most people pass over it too, and while it doesn't look impressive, I definitely recommend paying the extra 60 cents for the garlic parmesean dough.  It adds a ton of flavor.  Much better than the original dough used for the calzones.    

Even more surprising, the cookies are absolutely amazing, and HUGE.  I would prefer these over the renowned Insomniac Cookies anyday.  They only cost about $1.50 each, but seriously, the cookie is huge.  Something like a 6-7 inch cookie.  Some days even bigger.  For only a $1.50, it's like 3 to 4 times the size of an insomniac cookie and tastes just as good in my opinion.  They even have a special where you can get two free cookies with two calzones.  Don't skip on the cookies!

Location & Aesthetics - located in Goodyear off Litchfield Road.  The business is difficult to see and/or notice from Litchfield Road and there weren't any signs that I could see. (-1)
As you enter the shopping center/area, there's Target and Michael's in front of you.  I proceeded straight and took a right toward the Starbucks and only upon doing so we saw a sign with an arrow that the business was ahead.  
Once you turned right toward Starbucks, you will make a left turn as if going to Starbucks, then you will see the restaurant.
Parking can be difficult to secure as the parking is shared with many of the surrounding businesses to the left and right, e.g. Starbucks and a tanning salon.
The restaurant was clean, and well lit from the indoor lighting and from outside as well.
Noise was minimal.  There's a TV in the corner but was muted with subtitles on.
The restaurant is on the small size so if you're bringing a large party or gathering, I'm guessing the staff will have to join some of the tables together.
As you enter, the checkout is directly in front a few feet away
We were promptly greeted and asked if we were dining in, how many, and directed to sit.  Menus were brought to us immediately.

Menus - the menu was extensive and many (if not all) of the dishes were in their Vietnamese names though with english explanations beneath.

Service - a waitress appeared, greeted us, was very friendly, and took our drink and food orders.  It's not a big deal but I felt that she could've asked if we had been there before or if we have ever tried their dishes, etc.  Or perhaps she could've offered some suggestions to try even though we didn't ask for any.
My only gripe - offer eating utensils that is individually wrapped in napkins versus being given to you by the person who brings out your dish to the table and rests your eating utensils on the table. (-1)
Food - I had the Cm tm (#40 on the menu) which consisted of rice with fractured rice grains, with grilled pork plus the Vietnamese dish bì (thinly shredded pork mixed with cooked and thinly shredded pork skin) over broken rice.  The rice was steamed well and wasn't dry but very moist and sticky as it should be.  The pork was cooked well and wasn't chewy but very flavorful and well seasoned.  The thinly shredded pork wasn't for me as it's apparently served cold and had a somewhat of a burnt smokey taste to it which I didn't quite like.
The rice and meat are served with various greens and pickled vegetables, along with a prawn paste cake.  The vegetables and greens was fresh, crunchy, and well cooked though I didn't get much of the pickled taste I was supposed to pick up from them.  The prawn paste cake was interesting in terms of taste and texture but was palatable, edible, and I enjoyed it.
I've been told that the dish can also be prepared with trng hp (steamed egg), and grilled prawns however I didn't see any of these on my plate.  
The dish also came with a small bowl of, what I believe is called, nc chm which I'm told is to cleanse the throat or can be used for dipping as well.  Well, it did exactly what it was supposed to do - cleanse the throat.  It was much too strong for me and unfortunately I had to leave it back.  I'm guessing it must've been from the vinegar in it.
The dish also had a fried egg as well which you can request to have cooked well done as I did.  I'm told that instead of the fried egg (though I can be incorrect) the dish is served with a ch trng egg meatloaf.
For drinks, I had a strawberry smoothie (don't know the word for it in Vietnamese).  It was freshly made and was very tasty.

I think this place is worth coming back to particularly in winter and fall when the temperature starts turning cold so that I can try their Pho so to be continued....",2015-08-02 05:53:03

The aroma of the spices in the soup when they first sit the bowl in front of you made my mouth water. The place was busy but there were tables available. Still, it took quite a long time to get our food and the waiter - though very friendly and helpful - seemed overwhelmed with cleaning other tables, etc. contributing to the slow service.

We ordered a large pizza topped with just pineapple (a favorite of a girl in our lab, who's vegetarian), an order of chicken wings spiced medium, and a 2-liter of soda (Sierra Mist). When I arrived to pick up the order, we were greeted by a gentleman who told us that he had just called Tim (the guy who placed the order) to let him know it was done- he didn't want to take it out of the oven and let the food get cold. ""Cool!"" I thought, as I paid the man and picked up our food, which came out to about $28. So while we were carefully juggling all the food, he asked us where we worked and asked us to hand out some menus and call him after our meal to let him know how everything was. They get an A in guest service, I really appreciate when an owner cares about the guest, but the food wasn't all that special.

Pizza: The dough wasn't that bad, but the sauce was lackluster. Unfortunately, bland sauce typically means bland pizza. Cheese was adequate and there was plenty of pineapple on the pizza. It was nothing to write home about, but it wasn't terrible either. I don't know that I would come here for their $3.99 2 slice pizza special as others have come for, since I imagine that re-heated ordinary pizza is probably worse. 

Wings: The wings weren't bad. There was no spice to them at all, and they were overcooked a bit (I think the restaurant probably par-cooks them before then refries them to order to make sure everything is cooked). Although I appreciate them taking the time in serving fully cooked chicken, they would definitely be better if they were cooked completely to order. There was many more wings than I had expected, although they were small. One more bone to pick, if I must, there weren't any carrots or celery served with the wings. :(

THE RANCH HERE IS DELICIOUS!! It probably knocked the wings up from 2.5 stars to 3. 

Overall, it wouldn't be my first pick for pizza. HOWEVER, since the place is right across the street from UNLV, I imagine we will be ordering from here at least once more. I plan on calling the manager/owner tomorrow and letting him know how lunch was. Who knows, maybe they'll impress me next time. :)",2013-12-20 06:04:39

I do understand what other reviewers have said about profiling, as I am a white, middle-class woman, and am hardly ever asked for my receipt.

The jets in the tub weren't functional. The bath is huge and comfortable all by itself, but some jacuzzi-like action would have been amazing.

The water pressure in the shower is dismal, and the sensor is faulty. We couldn't get the water a decent temperature -- it was either super hot or really cold. 

The train. Oh, the train. Our room overlooked the tracks, and the noise from the horn blaring was unacceptable. If Trump knew that this was happening, there should have been better sound-proofing on this side of the hotel. My other friends didn't have this issue with their rooms, since they were on a different side of the tower.

Now the good.

The hotel itself is pretty.

There is no casino, so it's quiet and convenient to walk from the front up to the room.

There is a free shuttle that runs to the Wynn and to Caesar's Forum Shops (and to some outlets, I believe) every 10-15 minutes. We spent the majority of our time at the Wynn, so this was awesome. 

Room service at 4am was amazing. The chicken noodle soup was a group favorite.

The food isn't life-altering, some of the time it's not even good, but then you'll have that relative come into town who's the pickiest eater in the world and you don't know where to take her.

In my situation, I took her to Milestone's. And she STILL couldn't find anything she liked. Cheese pizza (!!!). That's all she liked. But I digress.

Milestone's isn't awful. I generally avoid going to it because it really does nothing for my appetite, but when I get dragged there, I'm not going to cry about it. They've got a menu with enough choices for me to find something that I like. Prices aren't super cheap, but that's to be expected here, and generally when I'm here, someone else is paying.

And in the summer they've got a decent patio that they cram with people who all want to see what's going on outside.

iqOXA7i31INQ-L1HD8-FHg,F-1ClQ8bSEp2T7NSnVYNRA,cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg,1,11,11,7,"After my prior experience, I ended up going back to this place out of desperation for some Mexican food, several times in fact, and as of this writing, I still don't have a suitable substitute. That said, I'm pretty sure I won't be going back at all anymore. I'm done, just utterly and completely done, with this place. 

Why? Well for starters, the service has not improved, despite numerous complaints and having spoken to the owner personally. Same servers still working there, still delivering crap service. Same waiters pulling the same tactics (start good, then disappear) and always the same excuses (I got busy, they have me all over the place, etc.). Latest hilarity ensued when a regular server, whom we've been tipping 20%+, handed us off to another gal because, in her words, she was pretty busy and wanted to make sure we didn't get bad service. The other gal gave us worse service than we'd had in a long time. Good intentions don't really help me get my drink refilled or bring the check this century. 

Secondly, the food quality seems to be taking a dive. I say this as someone that regularly orders the same stuff, to the point where it was sometimes awkward because the server would ask me if I was having my usual meal. So you can imagine that it's not too difficult for me to perceive a trend over time, at least insofar as how they prepare the dishes I keep ordering over and over. The meat? Seems to have less flavor and taste less fresh more often than not, especially the beef. Sauces? Unpredictable amount of heat. Some days you burn your mouth off on the green sauce in the ""Three Amigos"", other days you get more kick from the free chips and salsa. Go figure. I also noticed the steak in the ""Tampiquenas Dinner"", which used to be excellent, is now served straight out of a microwave and is limp, tasteless, soaking wet and completely inedible. They ask you how you want it cooked, but no matter what I have said, it comes out well done and clearly microwaved. In a word, it's just disgusting now and I've had to stop ordering it. Most recently I ventured into their ""Chimichanga Dinner"" item, opting for chicken. First time it came out with beef, but I was so hungry I ate it anyway and didn't complain. Second and third time, consistent with the first time, it came out less than adequately fried and soggier than I care for. If it's just a wet tortilla with semi-crisp/crunchy end pieces, I hate to break it to you, but that's not a chimichanga. If I wanted a burrito, I'd have ordered one, right? Beyond that, even the rice doesn't come out consistent. Sometimes mush, sometimes perfect, more often than not, though, it comes out hard and chewy. How do you screw up rice at a Mexican restaurant? 

Last but certainly not least, I need to point out the recent renovations to the dinning area. I once considered this place to have some of the nicest classic Mexican restaurant ambiance I had found in the valley. The floor tiles, the wall full of photos, the artwork and the decor, the wood beams and wrought iron adorning the walls and ceiling outcroppings, the circular corner booths, subdued colors and walled off drink/check stations. Heck, even the paintings hanging on the walls and the murals and artwork painted on the walls themselves were true to the theme. You walked into this place and you knew you were in a Mexican restaurant. Now, however? They've ruined all of that. Utterly and completely ruined it. 

You step into the dining area today and you find green, yes light green booths (mixed with a few dark chocolate colored ones) bright turquoise and white walls, dark brown/grey roof paneling and even faux-wood laminate on the walls. The pictures are gone, the murals are gone, the overhead decorations are gone. If it were not for the Mexican tracks pouring out of the speakers, you could be easily forgiven for thinking you had wandered into some kind of ridiculously pretentious coffee and sandwich shop, designed to attract millennials and hipsters. What in the heck were they thinking? To add insult to injury, or perhaps the converse would be more apt, the booths are horrifically stiff and remarkably uncomfortable. It is bad enough that we actually witnessed a couple of geriatrics get up, tell their server ""this (booth) sucks, we're moving"" and proceed to take an open table next to a screaming baby instead. 

These people should be ashamed of themselves for what they've done to this place. It no longer looks at all like a Mexican restaurant, no longer feels like a Mexican restaurant and, even if you could get past the pretentious, hipster coffee shop ambiance, the food is sub-par at best. I really have no idea what they were thinking, but they better hope there are a lot of pretentious hipsters out there looking for over priced, below-average Mexican food and shoddy service in a restaurant that is, like them, trying too hard to be edgy and different.

The gist of our take: good food, but sorely overpriced and the music is always too loud, to the point where you can barely hear yourself think.

As a vegetarian, the options for me there are incredibly limited. It's either a risotto ($32 for it with no meat) or a $14 tomato/avocado salad with fried cheese (expensive but very good).

Going down the whole menu everything seems grossly overpriced.. the main one being the Lobster poutine ($20)... the portion is way too small for that kind of price.

Expect to pay $50/person for a 2 course meal, without drinks. 

The food is solid but I have a feeling Chuck's fame is adding too much perceived value to his restaurant, and for the price there are much better places to eat in Montreal, even in the Old Port area (DNA for example).

Overall, I was impressed with their brunch considering its bar atmosphere. They have a wide selection of items, from the traditional ""big breakfast"" to breakfast poutines, stuffed french toast and duck benedicts.

I opted for the ""Mexican Waffle"", which turned out to be a good choice. It consisted of 3 eggs, cheddar cheese and bison chili served over a crisp waffle. It's served with fresh guacamole, crema and salsa which added a nice sour component to the otherwise savory dish. It's a bit heavy, but oh so good. There were no leftovers. 

They had a decent selection of draught beers and ""brunch libations."" I ordered a ""Gastrohouse Caesar"". It was a little pricey at $10 but it had the perfect amount of heat and saltiness. The green bean garnish was also a nice textural and tasty touch.

There are signs posted on the wall telling you not to use your cellphone when you are ordering, They accept credit cards not debit with a minimal $10.00 purchase. That is never a problem for me since my banking cards have both options attached to them. They also won't service you if you are in line straddling a bike.

The size of the cones they serve are reminiscent of Isaly's. Prices are reasonable for the quantity you get. Believe me when I say unless you are very hungry order a small. It is huge!

in addition to soft serve cones and cups they also offer hard ice cream in various flavors. I got to chat with the owner Mary who makes these flavors up herself and adds her own special touch to them. Yes, you can sample them. Since I prefer hard ice cream I settled for two scoops of Black Forest ice cream complete with cherries. She offered me a lid and explained the things the business does.

In addition to selling ice cream and the usual flare every Fri and Sun evenings when it is nice they have a DeeJay come out and play music from the 50s. Once a month they have a special event. Recently they had a group of students from CMU come out and teach people how to line dance. They have a car cruise in the works. More information she told me can be found either on their website or Facebook page.

My ice cream was very good and quite filling! There are a couple of picnic tables you can sit at if you wish. There isn't very much parking in the area. They also have a rewards card. You must spend a minimum of $3.00 to get a hole punch and then after 10 punches you get $1.00 off your purchase.  They also have ice cream for purchase if you want a quart, half gallon, etc. Costs a bit more than the grocery stores but hey if it's good then it's worth the money to me.

This place is close to home so I definitely plan to return to check out more of the offerings. Next time I may bend and try a soft cone dipped in chocolate. So much to choose from. Definitely 4 1/2 stars in my book.",2016-06-19 18:17:53

First off I will agree, the staff are friendly.  That is pretty much all this restaurant has going for it though.  Never having eaten here, my husband and I decided to give it a try for takeout.  We were told 10 minutes on a to go order which ended up taking about 25 minutes.  Seriously 3 other people placed to go orders, received their food, and left in the time we waited.  The staff was very apologetic and threw in an order of egg rolls for free in spite of the fact that we had not complained at all about the wait time.  So service is good, but what really counts is the food.  I really had a good idea when we unpackaged the meal and took out the glow in the dark pink sweet and sour sauce.  If a restaurant is going to serve over processed, sub par condiments there isn't much hope for the food.  The egg rolls were extremely greasy and rather tasteless.  The pork fried rice was over all rather bland and had a previously frozen quality to it.  Nothing tasted remotely fresh.  Finally the coconut chicken we ordered was inedible.  The chicken was stringy and so hard you could not stab it with a fork let alone chew it.  The sauce again appeared to be processed but since we couldn't eat the chicken it was hard to really gage it's quality.  To sum up we paid over $20.00 for some rice that tasted like what my mom used to make from a box in the 70's and greasy egg rolls.  We could have gone down the street to Panda Express for half the price and twice the quality.  Pretty sad when the fast food option is better than the sit down.",2011-04-04 10:17:31

On my first trip to Paris 66 I tried their Beef Bourguignon and it was pretty good.  I also tried their Quiche Lorraine and their French Pizza.  The quiche makes me happy.  Like so happy.  Finding a quiche place in Pittsburgh.  Om nom nom nom.  The pizza was eh; I'd never order it again.

On my second trip I decided to get their savory Paris 66 crepe (mushrooms, tomatoes, ham, and an over easy egg.

Good to know because the downtown location told me the sauce was vegan and safe, it clearly isn't if they are using mayo. She then went on to inform me that they fry the vegan falafel in the same oil that they fry their chicken in. Um... Wait what? I had to ask her how this was even possible... And why on earth they would have the nerve to use the word vegan in anything on the menu that was being cross contaminated with animal products. In all fairness... The ingredients uncooked are vegan... But the second they hit that fryer... They are contaminated with fat and oil and enzymes from chicken. It's vegetarian at best...

The veggie crepe has tomato, spinach, cheese, and basil sauce (which I asked them to go light on). It was hot and delicious, though maybe a little too cheesy for my taste. The sweet crepe was made with fresh diced strawberry, a little powdered sugar, and the perfect amount of Nutella. It was also delicious.

So I have strong opinions about Brazilian steakhouses in general...take that for what it's worth, and please believe me when I say that I actually was looking forward to the dinner, as I'd heard good things about Chima despite my reservations, and heaven knows I LOVE me some meat, so I didn't go into this experience with a bad attitude. That said, Chima is specifically doing a number of things wrong that I just can't overlook:

1. What are Brazilian steakhouses known for (hint: it rhymes with BEAT)? Yep, you got it: MEAT. And not just any meat - BEEF. Yes, they have pork and chicken and all that, but the vast majority of the meat that they're pimping out at every table are beef. And what goes well with beef? Wine. WINE, people! Red, red wine. Steakhouses have a unique opportunity to showcase stellar red wines, since most patrons or eating red meat, so I would expect Chima to have amassed a wine list chock full of big, full-bodied, anvil-on-your-tongue-type reds with a lot of character. Sadly, their wine list has a fairly paltry selection of reds, both in quantity and quality, and the by the glass selection was a completely joke. I mean DEPLORABLE. I tried three different glasses in hopes that SOMETHING would be palatable, but alas...I was disappointed at every turn.

2. In my opinion, very little of the meat selection is worth what you end up paying for it. Even if I'd stuck to only the bacon-wrapped filet, I'd have ended up feeling robbed. Don't get me wrong, it's not TERRIBLE; price entirely aside, the meat is fine...but I'm telling you, it's not worth the premium they're charging you for it, not even a little bit. Again, this is an issue with most Brazilian steakhouses, which is why I say...just go to a real steakhouse. Get ONLY the steak you want (instead of a 1 you want and 10 others you don't want), and pay less. I'm not trying to be cheap - I've been to Wolfgang's CUT in L.A. and paid out the wazoo for the wagyu - but you know what? THAT WAS WORTH IT. I paid a premium, but got a stellar steak. I can't say the same for what I got at Chima.

3. The servers are mostly inept. There just seemed to be...confusion. I tried to order a glass of wine before the last 2 people in our party arrived, and the server seemed to not understand that no, I did NOT want to wait for them...am I not allowed order a glass of wine while I wait, for crying out loud? The real issue came, though, when we tried to split the check. We have 13 people in our party, and were initially told we could only split the check 2 ways. Then, inexplicably, we could split it 6 ways. But the punch-line of this whole ordeal was that they were USING AN IPAD. I'm fairly certain that laziness - not system limitations - was the culprit of our check debacle. And after all that, our server couldn't even get the check's right, so one of my co-workers ended up paying for one of my glasses of wine. Ridiculous. 

Needless to say, I will not be back nor will I ever recommend or say anything good about Chima to anyone I know. Overall I find it to be a poorly executed steakhouse of sub-par quality, and I can think of at least 50 restaurants within a 5 mile radius of this place at which I would rather eat. Again, this is merely my opinion, bu hey, that's why you're on Yelp, right? Take it with a grain of salt.",2013-12-17 20:54:10

Well, it was a Sunday so being in Calgary, we obviously had to go for brunch. I still can't get over how much Calgarians adore brunch - it reminds me of Montreal so much. We decided to check out Dairy Lane Café, which apparently has been in the Hillhurst  area since 1950! Wow, 65 years and going strong. 

The place is tiny and packed. DLC is one of those places where you're right in the grill of your table neighbours but the chatter is loud enough that you can carry on a conversation without feeling like others are eavesdropping on you. People were constantly putting their names down on the wait list. Crappy weather meant the patio was closed and inside can fit about 20 people or so. 

Arriving around noon (way too late), we were told the wait would be about an hour. At least they give you coffee/tea on the house while you wait outside. Or more like death stare the people sitting by the window and will them to hurry up and finish their last piece of toast! 

- Stuffed French toast ($13.50) - two options to choose from (sweet vs. savoury) - we went with sweet. Cinnamon cream cheese and field berry compote on French bread with a side of local potato hash. We were both a little skeptical about cream cheese in French toast but the dish was well executed. Just enough that you could taste the cream cheese without it being overpowering. The French toast is huge with two slices topped on one another. The hash was good - nicely seasoned.
- Eggs benedict ($15.00) - three options to choose from (bacon/grilled tomato, smoked salmon/avocado or spinach/garlic mushrooms). We went with the smoked salmon! Two poached farm fresh eggs, english muffin, house hollandaise with a side of local potato hash. The eggs were perfectly poached. Smoked salmon and avocado is a great combo. Add that with the heavenly hollandaise sauce, you have a killer eggs benny.
- Marinated prawn tacos ($15.00) - this was on their featured menu. Three prawn tacos filled with roasted poblano pepper and avocado creama, cabbage, black bean pico di gallo, queso fresco and cilantro. It also is served with a side of BC kennebec potato fries. In hindsight, we should have asked to sub one of the sides for something less carb heavy (so many potatoes!) but all good, we know for next time. The tacos were excellent. The shrimp had a great flavour and the addition of beans gave the tacos additional heartiness. We had to fight over the third one, I won. 

Another good spot in town to grab brunch. Heck, they're even open for lunch and dinner. Get there early or else be prepared to wait. Tip - you can wait inside if you walk around the back near the washrooms. Hopefully, next time we'll be able to sit out on the patio.",2015-09-18 15:01:41

My friend ordered the shrimp sliders, and we got the crispy deviled eggs as a starter. The staff was very friendly, no snobbery going on here! The food was fantastic! Fan-fkn-tastic even. My pasta was so perfectly cooked, I'm pretty sure they made the pasta in-house. It was delicate yet sturdy, with the bacon adding a sweet smoky flavor while the French beans provided a tart crunch. It was perfectly executed. The crispy deviled eggs surprised me because I was assuming they would've had sausage on them like a scotch egg. There was no sausage but I'm not complaining. The bottom portion of the egg (white part) was breaded and fried, yet there was no trace of greasy residue, just a tasty crispy crust.

I had gone in knowing the menu would be the same as the other Mercatto locations and had thus assumed the decor and vibe would be the same, but I was pleasantly surprised. The vibe of this location may in fact be my favourite - light, airy, and reminds me of european cafes (whereas other locations are quite small, dark, and crowded). 

SERVICE:
Even though we were a medium-sized group, it took the servers a long time to bring our drinks and take our food order, which was quite funny as there were only 3-4 other tables seated at the time. Otherwise, service was great! They checked up on you about how your food tasted and if you needed more to drink. 

FOOD/DRINKS:
- Their wine menu was quite small, and ordering by the glass can be quite pricy. I had the Riesling which they had mentioned was the sweetest one on their menu. 
- I ordered the orrechiette as usual - nothing beats the savoury sausage paired with the bitter swiss chard. I am also quite a fan of the shape/texture of the orrechiette pasta (they remind me of ear lobes). Note this dish is not for you if you don't like bitter foods. 
- Lastly, I ended my meal with the tiramisu for dessert. It was so light and airy, exactly how a tiramisu should be. I just wished there was more in that ramekin, especially for the price. 

Overall, great place to eat if you're in the neighborhood. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants/franchises but I will come back again and again for their orrechiette as it's such a hard to find pasta these days.",2018-10-01 01:33:17

Before I start this review I want to clarify that the noodles at McRamyun are in fact instant noodles, and it's supposed to be that way. I make this clarification because I read a blog post where the reviewer bashed the restaurant for using instant noodles and compared it to the likes of sansotei and santouka. These comparisons are unfair because that's not what ramyun here means. Ramyun is korean, and often used in reference to instant noodles. Most items on the menu use instant noodles and combines it with a korean soup (ie. doenjang chigae) or a korean dish (ie corn cheese). I thought the construction of the menu is pretty clever. Now that terms have been defined I will move forth with my review!

I ordered the corn cheese ramyun and was too cheap to add a protein to it for extra $$. It was a wise choice on my point because it actually came with pancetta (i believe), and the cheese sauce itself made the dish real filling. Overall I enjoyed what I had. The sauce had strong cheese flavour and was not just plain white sauce and fresh veggies were included to balance the heavy dish. I do have trouble with the price point though. The dish is about $11 and since there were only a few pieces of pancetta I don't think that price can be justified due to low food costs. Unless the cheese for the sauce is really expensive?

What made McRamyun lose points was my friends dish. She ordered the ddeok (rice cake) ramyun, and unlike my dish, hers came in a soup base. It's supposed to be spicy but they were kind and accommodated her with a non-spicy soup base. On their menu they advertise that they will balance the unhealthiness of instant noodles with fresh ingredients. The soup however tasted too instant in both of our opinions and detracted from the restaurant's promise of an ""upgraded"" ramyun experience. My friend also mentioned that the ddeok were under-cooked.

Overall, I think this restaurant is novel enough for a single visit, but I have difficulty imagining myself returning due to the price point and the quality of the soup-based ramyun since that's the majority of the menu.",2015-08-03 04:33:01

The hostess/cashier said it was created after a ""German"" model. That was the first thing that struck me odd...if it's created after something German, why are they serving Italian? I'm sure Italian is more popular, but I could see it working with brats and beers just the same. 

We walked around with the ""debit"" cards, but found it feeling too cafeteria style for us. Plus, if the chefs/servers are waiting for us to order, there weren't any around when we were checking out desserts to sell us on one.

""This place is so over-hyped and overpriced. Don't go, Ev... you'll hate it. ."" 

These were the voices of the masses, but who cares about the blah-blahs of the peanut gallery? Not I. So I went with an open mind, a sound heart and an unparallelled love of lobster. 

I brought my fave Brits, Camilla Parker-Bowles and Austin Powers, and we all ordered different crustaceous treats. I had the lobster roll and the lobster caesar to drink. The drink was really the highlight. I mean, a lobster tail in my drink? Perf. The lobster dinner is only $39 and the lobster poutine was quite tasty, no matter how strange it sounds. 

So there you have it. It's not the best place, but it is definitely better than A-OK. I mean, how can lobster not be?",2013-06-10 18:50:38

If I hadn't heard such good things about this place I wouldn't have ever know it was there. Just a tiny little store front of a shop off the main drag in Dormont. It has a true Pittsburgh feel to it too. Something about it is just so comfortable and laid back. There is a little hutch with various handmade goods, local companies business cards, and interesting bits and baubles. (After further discussion with the AMAZINGLY friendly young man who was making our food, I found out the owner also makes soaps and spa gift baskets too!)

Ordering was no easy task, to be honest. A hot dog is not just a hot dog here. There are so many different combinations of dogs! I finally decided on a Wisconsin Ave dog and a Pizza Dog. My friend is a vegetarian so she got hers as veggie dogs. (Any dog they have they can make as a veggie dog too!)

The smells inside of this place are INSANE. When I think about hotdogs I'm rarely thinking about delicious smells. (I honestly thinking about my grandfather boiling hot dogs and I start to feel a little queasy.) This place is just packed with great smells. From the chili used, to cheeses, to the toasting of the bun when they do the final once over... all so good that it's making my mouth water now.

The Wisconsin Dog was so so cheesy! Four kinds of cheesy goodness and still not greasy. The cheese sort of encompasses the bun in the end too. Mmmm shell of cheese. The Pizza Dog was better than I had anticipated. It had the perfect balance of  sauce, cheese, pepperoni. Perfect ratio.

The restaurant is in a long rectangular room which I suspect is quite noisy when full, which it normally is at the moment. We would recommend the chefs bar, which has stools with backs to them and enables you to watch all the skilled preparation of the food going out of the kitchen. The interaction can be fun too, particularly if you pass over a glass of wine or two.

We had the octopus which is whole - not just a large tentacle but a complete small octopus and is outstandingly grilled on open flames, with a small amount of mint pesto on its arms and a beautiful white naval been base. The portion is big, plenty to share. Probably one of the best octopus dishes we've had in Toronto. We followed this with the mushroom pasta - firm pasta, great mushrooms (hen beak?) and beautiful cheese: Well executed. The pizza was thin, hot and tasty in the extreme. The halibut on the bone was also worthwhile. We found  our rapine to be a bit tough, although it looked good!

First of all, you're in Vegas and you're there to play; it was extremely disappointing to learn that there was no casino in the hotel. What? Trump hotel just off strip and no casino?!? That was a big miss - I wouldn't have booked the place directly, but it's what we ended up getting via Priceline bidding. Anyway, so they have these shuttles to the Wynn and Ceasers to try to make up for it. It works pretty well during the day. The ride to the Wynn is super fast. It's literally a block away on a quiet street. The thing is, the shuttles don't run too late - well relative to Vegas-time.

The lady at the front desk when we checked in wasn't very pleasant. She did a heavy up-sell job on room upgrades. We ended up keeping the room we booked. I noticed it's a trend at these Vegas hotels, but there was this additional $25/night resort fee we had to pay, which wasn't included in our original reservation. I wasn't completely surprised because I stayed a couple nights in another nearby hotel for a couple of nights before this one and they had it as well.

The room itself ended up being fine. It was spacious and had some nice features, like a TV in the bathroom mirror (not like that was practically useful). It was fine and the housekeepers were liberal with the bottled water, which was much appreciated.

I wouldn't stay at the hotel again, because you're paying near the high-end of the spectrum in terms of price, but you aren't getting the full Vegas experience without the  casino and so forth. I'm assuming they're trying to get approved for that as well, but I guess Trump should've played more nicely with Wynn in Atlantic City.

After a long ass drive to the middle of nowhere, shelling out big dough to a 'load-your-heavy-ass-furniture-your-own-damned-self' warehouse, I always try to 'reward' myself with a 'nice' meal - but not *too* nice, since I just spent hundreds or thousands on something for *work*.  Usually, this just means fried chicken or a McDonald's combo - but since I negotiated a 7% discount, I okay with 'splurging' on a $30 meal for my partner-in-crime and I.

We Yelped and found a gluten-free BBQ restaurant in the same industrial park.  I was thinking that this place was going to suck - a GLUTEN-FREE BBQ place in an industrial park serving a captive audience?  But I was too tired and hungry to argue...

But boy, was I wrong.  Sure, the place is small and seats 10 people at most and it's seems to specialize more in take-out/catering.  But the owner/chef instantly greeted us, confirmed that it was our first time there and offered me samples of the pulled pork and the eponymous brisket before I decided.  He recommended some awesome vegetarian options for the lady and we were soon seated and waiting for our order.

The owner/chef clearly has a passion for his craft and dude was a hell of a nice guy as well.  Filling us in on his catering options and his monthly specials (there was an Elvis sandwich with peanut butter and banana).

While the pulled pork sample was good, I had to order the brisket sandwich.  Not only because of the namesake, but because well-prepared brisket is glorious.  The brisket is juicy and tender and had a nice kick from the housemade BBQ sauce on a kaiser roll.  It was a large sandwich for only $7.  I had a bite of the lady's veggie wrap and it had nice hit of curry in it.  The onion rings are housemade as well and the batter was very crunchy and tasty.  I've been served many self-proclaimed 'best' brisket and onion rings before, and some of the finest examples I had was in a takeout joint in a Brampton industrial park.  Go figure.

We left stuffed for ~$25 total - with a belly full of delicious brisket and onion rings, I was almost happy to unload and install my expensive assed office furniture and work afterwards... ALMOST.  But at least I can look forward to coming back here again the next time I'm out in Brampton.",2013-08-10 07:17:02

They have game tables in the back that you can come and use at any time to play games and also a huge closet of games for you to to try out before committing to buying. Awesome! 

They also have nights that are designated for certain games so you can enter competitions if that is your thing.

The menu is short compared to other Mexican restaurants. The complimentary chips and salsa didn't arrive until after I had ordered so not sure if that's a regular practice or not. Most other Mexican places, they are there as soon as you sit down. The chips were decent but the salsa had an odd flavor to it that I couldn't pinpoint what it was.

For an entree I ordered the Enchiladas de Mole.  The highlight here was the mole which was amazing. Everything else was meh on this plate.  The enchiladas were like a folded tortilla, not rolled. The beans were nothing special and the rice was the worst thing of all with absolutely no flavor. I had to mix in the mole and beans to give it something.

Service was average and nothing really stood out.

So for Mole, I'd give them a 4 which allows this review to average out to a 3. Worth trying but not sure I'll be back since there are plenty of other Mexican places around.",2016-02-15 21:35:29

VIP seats are closer to the stage. If you are a local look into getting a deal as a local. My friend and I really enjoyed the show and happy we went. I would recommend the show.  

Theater: Located in Planet Hollywood at the V Theater. The theater itself is not that big; rather, narrow in length.  They use video footage and lighting to bring other elements to the show.

Performance: All live music and singing. In the show I attended, there was a contortionist who did a fabulous job.  I thought the jokes were funny. This is a zombie theme show and some people may get offended. If you were able to watch Absinthe at Caesar Palace and not get offended, you can handle the jokes here.  The jokes are meant to be kind of light and, yes, stereotypical.

Hype about the food and service is not to be believed. Both should, in fact, be readily dismissed. Between us, we ordered the poached egg omelet (stunningly bad); crispy wings (a bit too spicy for most palates); rice burger (tasted like a frozen dinner); and Tomahawk steak (only mouthfuls of fat).

Our server provided erratic service, seemed like he was either drunk or high on a substance, and failed to check back on us regularly. Horrendous.

The vast open space in the middle of uptown Charlotte, a spanking new bar in front of an open window.  So yesterday I went to test this place out for a late casual lunch.

I heard of the European Self-Service system, but it's still a bit confusing.  The hostess could have done a better job explaining, that's after I asked them about it (what happened to ""have you been here before... let me explain how this work?"").  Luckily on a late Sunday afternoon this place was virtually empty, so I didn't feel as bad for my cluelessness.  Basically you are given a card, which you swipe (think key card kinda swipe) before you order so they can keep track of your tab.  

We decided to split an Americana pizza.  I was interested in a side of soup, which sadly they didn't have any.  What's worse is when I asked the Pizza guy about soup, the response was something similar to ""I don't know, ask her.""  When I asked ""her"" the salad lady, it took her quite a time to acknowledge my existance, only for her to tell me not only they didn't have soup, but because they didn't have the ingredients to make soup... interesting.

Speaking of missing ingredients.  When we ordered my sangria at the bar, the bartender didn't have the basil... but he was gladly going to look for some in the kitchen.  I told him to just give me the $4 house white, but he forgot to change the order on the tab.  Basically it was quite choatic for a late Sunday afternoon, I can't imagine what it would be like during lunch rush!  (FYI, Captain & Coke is $8.50)

Food was decent.  $9 pizza is big enough to share if no one is starving.  The pizza was definitely fresh, I wish there were more toppings.  I glanced through the pasta menu, and I am wanting to try it next time.  

I can see why some people think it's not at all impressive, but I LOVE the space!  The red seating area by the bar, the clean simple lines of the furnitures, the openness, the high ceiling... all so causal yet chic.

Indeed one of these associations must be the ode to all things cowboy/cowgirl, the Calgary Stampede. From what I have gathered from my time here, the Stampede appears to be some preserved tradition that celebrates the spirit of the city and its preservation has nothing to do with the dollars it brings in year after year into the city. In celebration of the wild west, some of us don our cowboy/cowgirl finest much to the delight of some and simultaneous chagrin of other Calgarians.

For a long time I despised the cowboy theme. Perhaps it was because my roots belong to that rival city to the north where anything Calgary is shunned and despised. However, as one settles in this city and time flies by the next thing you know you start trying on western wear as a joke or for fun. More time passes and you begin to realize how comfortable cowboy boots can be and you find yourself at Lammle's eyeing the latest pair of python-skinned man boots and trying to justify the $250 price tag in your once logical mind. 

The selection here, and at most Lammle stores, is pretty amazing. Enough cowboy hats to supply a Stephen Ave confederate arm...er... police force. More pairs of cowboy/cowgirl boots than at a country and western bar. The service is great, pleasant and very patient. The price is ridiculous, but then again what do I really know about cowboys. Maybe this is the price that the market will bare, after all this is the wild west!

However, I do know this. If you are looking somewhere fun to window shop or for great Stampede wear or if you want to look like Mantracker, Lammle's should be on your list of places to visit.

The duck poutine pizza is perfect for sharing with your fellow dinning partners. sharing the crumbs that is.If you're going to order the poutine make sure to order the large one you get more bang for the buck.

First Course: a cheese selection consisting of two cheeses, candied walnuts and an apricot puree with sliced apples. It was a very nice starter.
Second Course: My choice was the Heirloom Tomato Salad with Burrata Cheese, Balsamic, Croutons and Basil oil. A tasty and a beautiful presentation.
Third Course: I chose the Roasted Salmon with Syrah Sauce served over Rice Beans and Tuscan Kale. The Salmon was cooked medium as ordered and had a great crispy skin.
Fourth Course: I selected the Tiramisu. Not the best I have had but creamy and filling. 

Service by our waiter Vince was friendly and attentive. Timing of the courses was well spaced and provided ample time to enjoy the lake and the various water creatures.

aWHo17Xy4iuGK9YQxZQeTA,r8c5CUnPp8WMl65ABnRNtQ,cVlW0omVTRaVJqnT-OBBsQ,4,4,2,3,"I first encountered Piola in Playa del Carmen, in Mexico. There, in the north end of the tourist zone it's a great upscale experience for a night out on vacation. So I was pretty excited to see on land down the street there in the new condo-plex on Queen West.

I see that they have garnered some decent reviews so, while I'm also gonna give them some decent stars I'm gonna hammer them here on the things they need to improve to survive here, because I wanna see them stick around.

In no particular order:

Good (but short) wine list. Chose the Aglianico (which is the same one they serve at LIbretto and available at the LCBO--thank god). A decent chianti is also on offer. 'Nuff said. Yay.

Starters: prosciutto -- definitely a superlative. Melts like Velveeta in your mouth. Beats the equivalent at Terroni/Libretto. Take that hipsters! Now, since you and I are both food snobs, how the hell do we know what Velveeta melts like? Good question. But we do.

So much for ""hammering"" them... but here we go...

Polenta & Ragu starter. The polenta is a superlative... the ragu.. well... it's a bit Chef-boy-R-dee... ... either tune up the Ragu or get rid of it. Parts & Labor do a beautiful polenta appetizer that is/was just polenta. Go with your strength here. (Nothing wrong with the ragu it just ain't worthy of the polenta.)

Pizza: the Lisbona. Worthy and delicious. As good as Terroni but NOT as good as Libretto. Beautiful crust and just a nice combo of flavors. You can't go wrong. But ... somehow, just not the same magic as they're pulling off at Libretto. Don't feel bad, Libretto has strong magic!!

Dessert: the Pana Cotta. Hmmm... too much gelatin. Nice flavor but this could have come out of a Jello plastic cup. Sorry. Tune this up.

Now the challenge ... the ambience... the place is very vibrant and bright. Clearly they have planned and executed a brilliant decor scheme here ... but it's more Starbucks than Dark Horse. Capiche? Your parents will think it's *very* cool. Burn, I know.

There are decorations on the wall made of writing and you can read them ... and it's like ... deep thoughts from suburbanites: ""Who invented spaghetti? The chinese or the italians? Best not to think of this before your food goes cold..."" or something like that I read on one line. Errrmmm... best not to read the walls.

Maybe dim the lights? Just a bit? 

And finally ... our waiter was undeniably super service oriented, a great guy, and good looking to boot, *but* ... tone it down a bit. Don't sell so hard. You think your Terroni waiter gives a **** if you don't like the food. If you don't like it you're an idiot! So maybe a little more of that and little less... mmmm... PIzza Hut rah rah :) 

Piola is also fresh and clean on a dirty strip of Queen West. It needs to find its groove. But right now, it needs some love, so if you've just been ejected from Libretto with a two hour wait, or the lineup is out the door at Terroni... cruise down the street to Piola, give your waiter a death glare, and settle in for some great food.",2012-03-13 00:59:14

Wasnt sure they served lunch because one website said they stopped but glad i checked because it was worth it. Its like a steakhouse on the Strip minus the surly service, crazy high prices, hassle of walking through the hotel and paying for parking. 

The dining room makes you feel as if youre in the 1920s and the female servers are dressed in fun uniforms. Not sure if they only have female servers which would be interesting because some steakhouses like Joes Stone Crab only have male servers . 

Lunch seemed to have a more varied menu and it wasnt as busy when we went but the food was still spectacular. We have the Prime Rib panini which was a really light and very flavorful steak sandwhich. It only had 3 oz of steak but it was more than enough. The prime rib plates are a lot but its fascinating to see it carved tableside and the sides served up in a matter of seconds. Id caution to be careful with portion size here as these are huge cuts. My other friend had the turkey sandwhich and while it was great it needed to either be grilled or updated with a better mayo spread. It was just very basic.

I also had a large strawberry margarita. Again, 3 stars. It was good but not mind blowing, although I'm not the hugest margarita fan so I should probably stop ordering them and being disappointed.

Granted, the portfolio was heavy on IPAs and pale ales in early October, but Resident Culture is strong out of the gate; fans of the beers at Heist and Salud Cervaceria will be happy here too.
 
A little further down Central than the more dense part of Plaza Midwood's food and entertainment area, the secondary temporary parking area was convenient. Good background live music for a Saturday afternoon and the Improper Pig food truck never disappoints. What I appreciated was the variety of seating options on the property and the fenced-in area with picnic tables was perfect for kids and dogs.
 
Obviously a new favorite for neighborhood residents and they pay attention to their surroundings with staff t-shirts in local team colors. You could easily walk between Legion and Resident Culture for a one-two punch, but the larger capacity is certainly appealing here.

I've driven past them in a couple other corners of the valley but had never heard anyone recommend them before. That's a shame because it's actually pretty good!

The north valley location on Bell Road looks a little older than the others I've seen, but the atmosphere is decent. It has that Phoenix 'Cantina' feel. Me and a friend were seated quickly and I overheard the host ask our waitress if she could take another table. Now they weren't super busy, but our waitress clearly had a full section because our service was lacking. Neither of us received a refill on our iced teas during the meal. Good thing we weren't super thirsty because normally, I'll drink at least two glasses at a meal. No matter where I eat, I'd like my server to stop by more than once to drop off the check.

The food is where I was impressed. It offers more than your typical Mexican fare. The specialties are unique and there is a decent amount of seafood available, as well as traditional items and tamales. My friends Spinach Enchiladas were fantastic! As I recall, it was more than just cheese and spinach. There was also mushroom and onions in there. Next time, I'm ordering that!

I chose one of my old standbys. I love fish tacos and the menu indicated theirs had grilled cod. I prefer grilled fish to anything fried. You can't see my tacos in the photo because they are delivered wrapped in foil. That's pretty clever because it keeps them warm until you're ready to dive in and add some of their creamy tartar sauce. That's also unique because I don't ever recall receiving tartar sauce at a Mexican Restaurant for anything! Plus it was pretty good!

Uniqueness aside, my rice was bland, which is common at most places. The chips and salsa were also nothing to write home about. I hate to give this place only three stars because it's quite good. Just not as good as some of my other favorite places. I will be back and see if they can improve on the service end.",2018-08-13 00:26:34

I believe it had one or two slices of pickle, which was lacking. It needed some sauce, that's for sure. The meats were yummy, but could've used a little smoke. They definitely need to improve the Cuban if they're going to keep it on the menu.

Although the name is deceptive because a bistro?  Really?  Maybe it's the new wave of younger Chinese?  The restaurant is clean and the people working there are Chinese and super friendly, polite.  That is a huge plus and caters to non-Chinese.  

When we came in, they gave us the non-Chinese menu.  My daughter asked what Moo Goo Gai Pan is.  I said, something non-Chinese people order.  My friend who brought us there said they have a Chinese menu, so we asked for that.

Most of the food is Cantonese, but I did see a couple things that were more northern, Mandarin food.  I don't know if they spoke Cantonese, because I only heard people speaking in Mandarin, but their English is very good.

As for the food, it was good and it was normal portions similar to a regular Chinese, Chinese restaurant.  During our near hour there, we saw mostly Chinese people come in, and only 1 table had non-Chinese people there.  

You know when you go to a Chinese restaurant and you see mainly Chinese people eating, it's more authentic and caters to the taste of the Chinese.  We are no exception.

The food was good.  We ordered 5 dishes - Curry Chicken (tasty), Salt & Pepper Pork Chops (decent, but I have had better), Singapore Mai Fun (good), Sizzling Pepper Beef (good taste and very sizzling), Eggplant with Minced Pork Garlic Sauce (I would not recommend as it had a slight sweet taste in it, which is not normal to me).  Four out of the 5 dishes we got were good.  The eggplant wasn't terrible, but it would not be a dish we would get again.  It really wasn't hot & spicy as we expected.  This was an odd taste for this dish that I've had many times at other places.

Service was good.

My only other comment is that most of the dishes did not come with serving spoons.  That was a bit odd that we had to ask for spoons and then they gave a small spoon for one of the dishes.  That is odd.

But, everything else was good.  The food came out hot.  The service was excellent.  We didn't  have to wait too long for the food.  We would come back again and I would recommend to my siblings & their families.",2015-09-06 00:57:03

I had read that if you ""name your own price"" and lowball it, you'll almost always get Trump, so I was happy I took this route.

We had the studio with the ""bad"" view because we didn't want to pay to upgrade and weren't savvy enough to try the $20 trick.  Note: if you want to upgrade the traditional way, it's $25/night for a better view and $50/night for a 1 bedroom.  The resort fees were $15/day and while you used to have to pay a $22/day surcharge for gym and $14/day surcharge for overnight parking, both of these are no more.

The studio was pretty spacious (mind you, this is my first time going to Vegas so I'm not able to compare it to any other hotels).  Most importantly, it was extremely clean.  When we decided to go away for the weekend, we heard about dirty Vegas hotels and wanted to stay away from these... so we were relieved that everything was spotless.  There was a hot plate and mini-fridge, as well as a microwave and some cookware, but we didn't use any of these.  The bed is really comfy though I think as others pointed out, the mattress is considerably smaller than the bed frame.

The bathroom is flipping awesome... maybe it's because I have a cramped bathroom at home, but first off - there's a giant jacuzzi and a giant shower - both of which are separate.  The bathroom is the size of the dorm room I had in college.  And the robes that you can use are really comfy too.

The pool is fine - I doubt that it's as flashy as most Vegas pools but it was perfectly okay by us.  Lots of people drinking in there, but also a lot of kids.  This seemed to be one of the more family-friendly hotels, since you don't need to walk through a casino to get to the rooms nor are you inhaling second-hand smoke 24/7.  The smoke-free environment was a big plus for us, as was having no casino.  

The location is off the strip, but it was about a 5-minute walk from the Wynn.  There is also a free shuttle to TI that runs every 15 minutes, btu we just walked to the strip and took the bus to get to places like Mandalay Bay.  During the day, you can cut through Fashion Show Mall to get to the strip if the heat/lack of a good pedestrian environment (i.e., sidewalks) gets to you.  There were plenty of cabs at the entrance, but we didn't want to pay an absurd amount to travel in 1/12 mile increments.  

The staff was all friendly and accommodating.  We checked in just after noon on Friday and did the 4pm late checkout, which was really nice because we were able to make a few last stops before hitting the road.  If we ever visit Vegas again, we plan on staying here again!",2009-08-31 06:29:46

Cleanliness: The place looked dirty in the inside.  But I still wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt since their sanitation score was in the nineties.  

Food: I got the fried chicken (white meat) with collard greens, mac and cheese and an extra side of yams.  With a roll. 

Fried chicken was ok.
Mac and cheese was NOT cheesy enough and it was watery.  This was NOT good Mac and cheese. 
The collard greens had a sweet taste to it. Some people may like that, but I don't.  It didn't taste good at all. 
Yams.... Some reviewers said that it would make me want to slap my mama.  That was a load of B/S.  The yams that I had was the WORST.  Watery and gross. 
And my roll.... Was burned.  

This place needs to shut down.  I realize that some places are a hit or miss.  But, based upon the yelp overall score of 2 stars... I should have known.  But I had to try it for myself. I left this place with a bunch of food.  And when I got home...my trash can received a bunch of it.   Never again......",2015-05-17 21:11:00

Every time I come here I am so happy. The place is usually bustling and busy, yet I never have to wait. The service is so friendly that I feel valued as a patron and the food is great.  

Some of the dishes I recommend: 

- The salads are out of this world. All of them are a good choice. My fave involves onions, avocados and mangoes

- The Cho-Cho is a great vegetarian dish. I'm a flesh eatin', animal killin' meat eater but I still enjoy this menu item

- Fish! Every fishy is yummy here. The best are the Sea Bass, Shrimp and the Tilapia

 - The Pollo Cubana is an excellent basic chicken/rice/bean dish 

 - The Ropa Vieja was okay. Pretty good but not out of this world

- The desserts are excellent. The coconut flan with mango sauce is my new favorite thing ever 

- They put limes in my diet coke. YES! Nice touch.

1- Walk up to the front desk and grab menus, an order pad and a table number card. 

2- Sit down and pick something to eat. You have 975 (no joke) choices of authentic Chinese/Taiwanese dishes. If you end up chosing sweet and sour chicken you deserve a slow fiery death.

3- Write your entree number and the quantity (figure on getting one entree per person and having leftovers, unless you are super-hungry. You will get rice with the entree) and return the order to the lady at the cash register, who will take your money.

4- That lady will give you glasses for water and direct you to where the tea is.

5- Wait 10 min or so. Don't fret, they will bring your chopsticks and napkins.

6- Enjoy the shit out of your yummy vittles. Don't forget to share, as no matter how freaking good your selection is, whatever your fellow diner got is just as good.

I've had the Salt and Pepper Shitake Mushrooms (they are not on the menu, but the lady at the counter knows what you are talking about) and the Crispy Tofu as featured at http://champaign-taste.blogspot.com/2010/11/golden-harbor-authentic-chinese-cuisine.html These two are freaking divine.

The broth had a distinct and overly strong Cajun spice taste, which is not what you think of when you think of the typical clean beef broth used as the base in most shabu shabu places (even if you get the spicy broth, it should be spicy but it should not be changed in flavor by the spices). The papaya salad was bland and flavorless, not spicy, vinegary, or have any ""bite"". The little Thai style dumplings were better than the shabu shabu sadly, which is why we went there. They had a decent selection of veggies, meats, and sauces but the broth which I was really looking forward to on a cold winter night was disappointing and ruined the meal I was so looking forward to. $53 for two people (without tip)?

The restaurant is located in the Smith/Chase complex.  By the way, for some reason, this complex rocks!  We have experienced three excellent restaurant choices here:  Sushi-Mon, Thai House, and now, Shabu Grille.

When we arrived, it was packed (a good sign!).  We were seated in the back room and were waited by 5 different people.  It was awesome.  For an asian restaurant, this was refreshing.  They were attentive and really took care of us.

We basically ordered the AYCE hotpot.  We were told to head over to the refrigerator and pick and choose what we need.  In the fridge, there were:

1. Lobster
2. Crabs
3. Shrimp
4. Mushrooms (Asian strands)
5. Beef,
6. Pork
7. Various veggies

It was a buffet dream baby!!  Only complaint is that the plates used to pile on the stuff were awfully small and flat.  It was tricky to keep it on the plate.  Because, it was flat, it would easily slide off.  Would recommend they buy BOWLS (plastic is fine).  This can be easily remedied.

In addition to the hot pot buffet, there is also a side menu (included in AYCE) that you can order.  We ordered wings, seaweed salad, edaname, and several other goodies.

Dinner definitely filling!

Here is our rating:
Food - 5 Stars
Service - 5 Stars (surprisingly! Excellent)
Ambiance and Location- 4 stars
Price - 5 stars (AYCE dinner is only 19.95 and I was told lunch was about 14 bucks!)

The kids who work here, don't really know what they're doing. You definitely can't hear them on the other side of the glass. The customer ahead of me and I looked at each other twice wondering what the heck was going on because we both had to repeat ourselves a few times. I realized the easiest way to get what you want, is to just 'point'.  

The guy who took care of me definitely did not seem like he knew much, didn't engage much in conversation ( it wasn't busy, just me and the customer in front of me, whom the female employee helped). When he rung me out, he didn't say, 'Thank you.' Customer service is VERY important to me so I really took note in remembering this experience. As I left the restaurant, I always say a, 'Thank you' before I walk out the door....only the female acknowledged and said, 'Have a nice day.'

For the price I paid for a regular bowl, I think they should put more fish in it. A half cup of poke in a big bed of rice isn't worth it....rice is CHEAP! Not to mention that the poke didn't seem very fresh. There's a ton of poke bowl restaurants up and down Rainbow Blvd and I know competition is pretty steep. For a place that's literally at the end of Rainbow Blvd, where most people don't go to unless they live near, I think they should step up. 

As for now, I will continue to drive up the street and go to the other poke place where one would get your money's worth....and they have better customer service.",2018-03-19 14:23:26

There are so few of those left anymore, so I appreciate the chance to patronize the little guy (at least some of the time). That being said, this isn't the newest or nicest theater around, but it's perfectly adequate. It's a bit old and outdated, but clean (including the bathrooms). Snacks are fine -- the popcorn here isn't as good as other theaters, but passable. And I appreciate that they give you free refills on both their large popcorns AND large drinks, unlike most theaters which only refill your popcorn and then count on you to die of thirst and pay for another soda. Uhhh, I mean...not that I'm ever gluttonous enough to eat a whole large popcorn and then get it refilled. Nope.  

Anyway, in my experience, it's never super crowded, which is nice (I don't particularly enjoy playing Elbow Wars on the armrest with some stranger sitting next to me). They do have stadium seating in a few of their bigger screens (usually used for the big blockbuster movies), but the smaller screens have the old-school seating set up (and those typically are used for the less popular movies).

Prices are about on par with other theaters, if not a bit cheaper ($9.00 for an evening show, $6.50 for a matinee).They also have a great special on Mondays...$5.00 for any showing with a free popcorn.They primarily show mainstream movies, but occasionally they will surprise by playing more limited-release films too (big shout out to Waterworks Cinema for being one of the first theaters in the area to screen ""Boyhood"" recently).

They're famous for they're chicken & waffles--gourmet of course. And they're absolutely delectable. You'll be licking your plate clean (if that sort of thing was appropriate here, of course).

For a Tandoori Shrimp salad , that they forgot to put shrimp on & the Frenchy well I think this sandwich would definitely offend the French. There was very little meat and it was way over cooked. Then it was another 10 minutes for my friend to get her shrimp! 

Back to the server..... Wouldn't you notice when bringing the food to the table that a Shrimp salad had no shrimp?! I mean she took the order, she entered the order and she delivered the order. When we told her um excuse me isn't this salad supposed to have grilled shrimp? She replied "" oh yea, it's not under the lettuce?"" then she left and came back after 10 minutes with the shrimp.

The quality of the food here is pretty good. There are still throngs of corporate guys and gals everywhere to make sure that happens. Looks like a pretty happy solid crew in this epic and very busy fast food joint.

I thought the portions were a little small, especially for the prices. Burgers run between $5.50 - $9.50 and are pretty small, fries are 4 bucks, again small, and a 5 dollar hot dog looks great. We hit the magic $20.00 per person check average with some drinks, burgers, fries and a shared CamleShack. Heck lot's of people are paying it so if they can get it?!?!. I paid my bill with a little sticker shock, and probably wont rush back based on prices alone.

And of course, there's lots of seafood options as well. The flounder filet is delicious; I lost count of how many plates I had. It's especially good dipped in Ponzu sauce and sesame oil. The squid, clams, and fish balls were great as well. 

I used a RNG (Random Number Generator) to pick some items from the menu. #6 came up twice...Chicken Cake. I had no idea what that was, nor did it sound too appealing. It ended up tasting pretty good, dipped in Sweet Chili Sauce from the Chicken Wings. It's like Salmon Fish Cake Patty you find in Thai restaurants.

The food is already smoked/cooked, so why on earth it took almost 30 mins to get food is beyond me. After finishing our food and putting our napkins on our plates, it took another 10 mins for the bartender to ask us about dessert, 10 more mins to get dessert, and after those were finishes, 10 mins to get out check. After another 10 minutes, I ended up walking my check up to the bartender to run our card. The bartender wasn't even that friendly on top of it. It was like the people eating bothered her. She had about 4 customers at the bar and there were 2 other tables eating. Not even that busy. I also assume the bartender was some sort of manager the way she barked orders to the other staff.

And while I generally want to try lots of new restaurants, it seems of late, it's more miss than hit.

It's a new place at the corner of la gauchetiere and clark, in chinatown, it's a basement place so you have to walk down. The decor is very modern chinese zen, with chinese cities written on the wall in caligraphy, a nice touch.

We ordered hot and sour soup, tofu family style and some stewed pork belly. I've been dying to order pork belly for a long while, and you don't often see it on the menu. 

The taste overall is bland to too salty. The soup was a bit liquidy, so there was a problem with every dish, don't know if it's an off day with the chef but it was not spectacular.

The pork belly was a bit lukewarm, I would have preferred it more hot, and the taste was somewhat bland, I think it could have use more caramelization and more salt.

The sauce for the tofu was a bit too salty, even with rice it was hard to take. The soup had good taste and flavour, but needed to be thickened a bit...however the bowl was huge and cost only 8$, and it could easily feed 6-8 ppl.

2. Small plate #1 - spicy shrimp tacos: A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! They weren't honestly very spicy but they were SO good that we didn't care. Perfectly cooked shrimp, a yummy zippy sauce and the freshest of fresh ingredients. OMG my mouth is watering right now just thinking about them. You only get 2 tacos for 9 bucks which is a little steep but I'd pay it again and again.

3. Small plate #2 - Moroccan meatballs - These were very good. Flavorful and well cooked (I hate it when meatballs are kinda crunchy almost on the outside and spongy on the inside) These were uniform in texture and very good. I wouldn't rave about them (see point #2) but they were very good.

4. Small plate #3 - Peking duck confit mac and cheese - This stuff was the BOMB! Very rich so it's good for sharing. Noodles cooked perfectly, english peas were crunchy (as they are supposed to be) and the duck was so flavorful. This dish totally works with these ingredients together. YUM!

5. Beer selection - Fantastic! The bar is huge and there's lots of seating.

Overall - this place is great. I don't generally like the term 'gastropub' but I think if anything fits the bill, it's this place. Great beer selection, really good food. We'll be back again and again.",2011-01-31 01:57:36

A limo, albeit a dated one, will retrieve you from any reasonable location and quickly bring you to the Mansion entrance.  As you are escorted through the more private entrance, you get a glimpse of the higher-than-high limit tables and the equally impressive Mansion lobby.

Arriving at Robo, we were immediately greeted by name and seated in the main dining room, complete with purple sofas and yellow flowers.  Already set in our decision to max out on the food, we went with the 16-course degustation.  The menu is pretty consistent with the brochure provided at the end of the meal, and with all the blogs and foodie websites chronicling this place to death, I won't rehash the dishes.  I will note that the cherry gazpacho, caviar, lobster, soybean risotto, and mignardises courses were our favorite and absolutely blew our minds.  Choose your mignardises carefully as there are 45 of them, but only so much that can fit on your plate, although I'm sure that you could ask for more if you are so inclined.  We passed on the wine as we felt that would have put us over the food coma edge.

Final thoughts:  The presentation and whimsical creations wowed me, and nearly caused me to forget to taste what I was eating.  Thankfully the 16 courses aren't individually presented, otherwise it could have taken all night to eat.  I'm not a critic and certainly not the committed foodie like some others on here, but I couldn't help but notice how relatively disappointed I was after we had dropped over a grand and able to reflect on that meal.  I thoroughly enjoyed and savored every single bite, but still do not believe that as a whole it was 33% more satisfying than the French Laundry.

4 and 1/2 stars for the experience of a lifetime.  The meal was truly on another level, but my next trip to Vegas will not include Robo.  Perhaps the one after that..",2011-06-12 15:40:58

The food was cooked well but I'd have to say the experience of where you are dining is what you are paying for.  I wish when kitchens are using any kind of hot peppers on or in a dish they would state it on the menu,so I could have them left off/out.

The Gratinee Dauphinoise potatoes were much more flavorful than the mac n cheese, so even if you dont care for potatoes.... get them.  

Definitely worth the trip & cost for the experience of it.  Thank you again Jesus, Lisa & hostesses for being so nice & attentive!

I did a quick search on Yelp and this placed popped up.  I recognized the address due to it being near/next to Chino Bandido, but never knew this place was here.  Turns out that it just opened recently.  I got in my car, drove down, parked outside and walked in.  I was greeted right away and shown a menu of their sandwiches.  I decided to go with their version of a Cuban sandwich.  Their version of their Cuban is a little different than most.  Their version is described as, dijon crusted pork tenderloin, spanish chorizo, Swiss cheese, Sammiches own zesty bread and butter pickles, and German mustard loaded on our signature baguette.  I got the combo meal which included fries and drink.  Total was right around $11.00.  Here is how it was...........

Cuban Sandwich-  This thing was fantastic!  One of the best sandwiches I have had in Phoenix!  The pork tenderloin was sliced nice and thick, the spanish chorizo was thinly sliced into cirlces, the Swiss cheese was nice and melty, the bread was hot, toasty, crispy yet chewy inside.  The pickles were awesome, and the German grain mustard really tied everything together.  This sandwich was fantastic!  The fries that came with it were very tasty too.  They are a crinkle cut fry and they were fried up and salted perfectly.  A great meal.

While I was waiting for my sandwich, and during my lunch, the owner Jacob started up some friendly conversation.  I was wearing my St. Louis Cardinals hat and we started talking about baseball (he is a Yankees fan) and other things.  Really personable dude!  During our conversation, I started asking about the menu and other sandwiches and inquired if he ever had a meatball sandwich on the menu.  He told me that on Fridays, he did.  I told him I would see him on Friday to try it out.  Here is how that one was............

Meatball Sandwich (The Knuckle)-  This sandwich comes with toasty bread, sliced pepperoni layered on the bread, and then meatballs cradled inside the pepperoni, topped with cheese and then served with a side of marinara to put on yourself!  This sandwich was tasty as well!  The meatballs had a great texture and I liked the addition of pepperoni to the sandwich.  The cheese could have been broiled/melted just a little bit more, but the sandwich overall was very good.  Once again, the fries were great!  The best part of this was that it's his Friday Special.  Sandwich, fries and the drink are only $7.50!  Can't beat that deal!

During my meal, I chatted it up with Jacob and Mariah (hostess/cashier) for awhile longer and he told me about some menu additions he is thinking about doing etc.  Good times!

If you are looking for a local, friendly shop that serves great sandwiches, head on down here!  Prices are great, hospitality is awesome, and the sandwiches are unique and different compared to most other sandwich shops.  I will definitely be back to try out their other sandwiches and to shoot the shit with Jacob. I'm still thinking about that Cuban!  Might have to come back next week and get another.  It was fantastic!",2016-06-04 23:08:36

Locals like to check out new places on the strip on occasion. Though the charge for parking at the MGM is still a good reason to avoid certain strip properties.  Anyway, Morimoto's opened about 3 months ago, so they were very eager to please and provide excellent service.  We did not order sushi but I must say, the sushi bar looks fabulous!  We shared about five items off the regular menu.  We had two appetizers and three Entrees.  Entrees included: Black Cod, Angry Chicken, Yellowtail served in a bowl that was 450 degrees and cooked table side.  Every item was cooked to perfection. We finished the meal with the flaming chocolate dessert - it tasted absolutely fabulous - a good mix of light froth and heavy darker chocolate.  Service was excellent.

OJwMrAPhXQ7Tp6qHanYpyg,_w9HH9wAqt2cC_4SAiRu5Q,oJSa5HCiZXKLXxggQmecEQ,3,2,0,1,"We went last night with another couple.  I would categorize this meal as okay.

I went in with a somewhat negative impression of the restaurant.  I had made a reservation weeks ago.  The day before, they leave me a voicemail to confirm, but ask that I call back to officially confirm.  Why not just ask us to get in touch to cancel?  Kind of annoying.

On the voicemail, they mentioned that we'd be allotted a two-hour dining window.  I've heard of restaurants doing this, and I think it sets an inhospitable tone.  I know that restaurants have more than one seating, and I certainly am not one to hang out for an hour after we've finished our food.  Two hours is not really a lot of time, especially when the kitchen gets busy and we can't control when the food comes out or when our order is taken.  We ended up leaving 2.5 hours after our reservation, through no fault of our own.  

Nevertheless...  When we got there, we found that the service was very good.  We were greeted warmly by the bartender, while the hostess was seating another party.  Our server was knowledgeable, yet not stuffy at all.  Our water glasses were constantly being refilled.  The music was a pretty random mix, and played at a volume that gave atmosphere but didn't make us need to yell.  

The food was good, but somewhat over-priced for what it was.  We were encouraged to order for the table and share everything, but for four people, it ended up being a couple of bites of each dish.  The burrata and grape crostini, for example, was a single slice of bread topped with burrata and served with roasted grapes.  If the restaurant really wants to encourage diners to share, it might be nice for them to present the plates in a way that would make it easy to do so.  And really, a single crostini is not enough to share for four people.  The appetizers were all priced in the mid-teens, which, for their size, seemed like poor value, e.g. the baguette and gougeres ($4), which was four puffs and the equivalent of four slices of bread, the 1/3 cup of olives ($6), the charcuterie plates ($16) that consisted of 16 slices of meat... It just felt cheap.  

The mains were somewhat better value.  We really enjoyed both of the pastas we ordered, and the portions were appropriately sized.  The meat and fish we ordered were both delicious, but again, it wasn't great value or designed for sharing.  We had the rack of lamb, which was served as two big rib chops.  Maybe 4 ounces of meat in all, for $29.  The pickerel skewered by a twig of rosemary was great, but the accompanying black rice was drenched in butter.  

The salt caramel budino/pudding was really delicious. 

Overall, I don't think I'd go back here.  There are too many great Italian places in this city to bother with over-priced, poorly planned dishes, even if they are quite tasty.",2013-04-15 01:21:05
EERQbchpH7RSTc8pXjCnZw,U5YQX_vMl_xQy8EQDqlNQQ,HxSINQAplSFAn6of-wexcA,3,4,0,1,"3.5* is about right.  Good food, especially for the area, but not The Best Thai that I've ever had.  

The Good:
-  there's parking!  It's in the same plaza as Maurya East Indian Roti
-  sauces for the various dishes
-  Pad Thai Hor Kai (authentic pad thai) presented wrapped in a thin egg crepe.  I haven't seen this on any other menu before.  Flavour was good, not too sweet/sour, didn't taste any ketchup which is a good sign!

The NI:
-  We ordered the Nimman Platter.  I see now online that it's meant for 2ppl, but either I overlooked it or it didn't state on the restaurant menu.  We were 3ppl, so it was awkward to share amongst the 3 of us.  We had to break spring rolls in half, partially eat chicken skewers, etc.
-  veg in Thai Spicy Beef were pretty close to raw.  Could've been stir fried a bit longer
-  noodles in Pad Thai Hor Kai were a bit undercooked
-  Nimman Long Song, one of the few dishes that came with rice, wasn't hot enough
-  wait time in between apps platter and mains was quite a while, like 15-20mins.  Seemed like there were a lot of takeout/delivery orders, but patrons who dine-in need to be looked after as well.  I noticed that a table who arrived AFTER we did, got their food before us

I took my friend here for her b-day and everything was great! Our server was super friendly and attentive.  She ran around pretty crazy because a table of at least 20 people walked in, but she never forgot about us and her 2 other tables. She mostly cooked all of our food for us, with me just cutting things here and there, and she refilled our drinks promptly. She also brought our glasses of wine as soon as we ordered them. I really was expecting the worst because of everyone else's reviews so I was super happy that we received such great service (a party of one white girl and one very non-korean asian girl). 

The meats are great quality, and I will definitely say one order of kalbi per person is definitely enough. We actually only ordered one, because there were other things we wanted as well and were way too stuffed. It IS the most delicious meat on the menu, I'll say.

Many comment on its size. Remember this is an original Walmart. Not like the Supercenters. It appears they tried to put some groceries in this location to make it competitive with neighboring retailers. That wasn't a good idea... 

This location seems to attract a lot of not-so-great customers. Please don't yell at your family members in the store. 

This Walmart is not well kept what-so-ever. The parking lots needs refinishing, the interior could use a face lift. The merchandise needs to be reorganized. Why do you need to pack so much crap into a store? Go over to Target and take a few lessons from there store planners.... 

Avoid this location at all costs. Madison Area Walmart's tend to be poorly maintained.

I have been a member at many gyms over the years. I find Smart Gym to be a great value for the price. They offer a variety of VERY clean, well maintained, up-to-date equipment.

There's a lot of cool technology add-ons for those who want to use it. The internet/web/TV/games stuff on the bicycles, treadmills, etc make it easy to plug you earphones into to distract you while you work out - just remember to bring the plug-in variety as your bluetooth ones won't work on these.  I personally am not much of a TV watcher when exercising so I just shut off that feature and listen to my own music using my bluetooth earbuds.  

During the 6 months I have been a member, they have added several more pieces of equipment and specialized stations. I can't recall a time that anything was out of service or unavailable. I tend to use the free & cable weight areas & rowing machine. 

I find the staff to be pleasant and helpful. I personally did not feel hammered by the sales staff.  I am contract skeptical in general and everything was clearly explained to me, questions answered, no games. And, coolness!- my personal membership choice allows me to bring a guest with me EACH time I visit, so one of my kids, friends or husband can come along anytime.

 Terri, a personal trainer there, has been excellent at helping me w/ finding ways to improve fitness-wise while accommodating damaged & surgically repaired joints and the like. There are a variety of classes offered and the instructors are qualified and deliver. 

Evaluate what you want to use at a gym- you will definitely pay more for a pool and other water features because those are expensive to maintain. No basketball courts or the like. If that's what you want, they don't have it here- that's part of what keeps down the costs. 
BUT-- If you want a gym that offers a whole lot of equipment, a generous free weight area, the latest in cool new equipment and specialized classes, traditional classes,  spotless locker room, changing areas & childcare you will get it here.",2014-08-30 15:10:05

We decided to check out Chef Alejandri's new Baldwin village location of Agave Y Aguacate -- which is the complete opposite of cheap tacos.  
No tacos, instead there was a creative selection of Mexician inspired tapas plates.

The place was pretty busy on a very cold night and we were seated in the downstairs  bar area.  If you are seated on the first floor, the seating is a bench against the wall.  Eating and drinking at a 45 degree angle is completely awkward and uncomfortable.  
I would ask to be seated at a real table next time.

We ordered three items to start.

The Ceviche Verde ($13) was fish cured in lime juice with habanero and avocado.
The flavours were good...but it was a lot more avocado than fish.

Our second dish was the Pollo en Pipian Rojo ($11).
It was chicken dish with a red sesame sauce topped with almonds.
This dish was a bit of a disappointment... The sauce was bland and the dish was not very memorable.

The best item of the evening was the Tostada de Tinga ($9).
The pulled chicken and chorizo was moist and saucy.  
Avocado and refried beans were great for texture.  
The sauce was definitely spicy.  Loved this dish!

As for cocktails, I ordered the Paloma ($12).  Tromba, Steigl, and Grapefruit is a refreshing, citrusy, and awesome combination.

Overall, the food was good, but we were still hungry after.
I feel like I'd have to spend a lot more to be full.
However, I'll be back from some cocktails and maybe another round of Tostadas!",2014-01-27 04:04:38

Again a little lenghty but worth the read.
  We arrived and there was a huge line. But,  because I'm a club member we went to a line with nobody in it. We got checked in under 5 minutes. Then I went to rewards center to receive a new card as I had lost mine. Leticia was there to great me and welcomed me back. She gave me a new card and added my free play on my card that was part of my package Paul Utell set up for me. Daily slot play for my 4 night stay.
  I emediataly started gaming and Paul walked by and stopped to say hello. I might add these people see 10's of 1000's of people come through their doors. The mere thought of them remembering me is astonishing. The next morning we ate at Hash House a Go Go. We had Marilyn this time. What a sweet and bubbly person who took the time to get to know us. Our waitress from April Corrine come over and said long time no see and gave me a hug. Later I went to receive my free slot play again & Kady helped me out this time. Leticia walked up and said hello. 
  Tonight for dinner we ate again at Hash House a Go Go. Eric was our waiter and I had talked with him and Rebecca the night before to get a dinner menu to see what they had. They were ready to close but stood there giving me some dinner suggestions. I did take him up on his chose for dinner. 
  I have to mention someone VERY special. Her name is Monyetta (MO) she is the lead slot ambassador.  She recognized me the 1st night and came to give me a hug and say hello. I bumped into her ever night I was playing. If you EVER need anything after 1am when rewards desk is closed ask for MO. You can't miss her she's the one walking around checking on everybody with a HUGE smile. She can do almost anything and will within her power.   .. 
  Tonight is our final night here and I'm packing up for our drive home. But 1st I stopped off to get my last slot free play for the day from Nichol. (to try and recoupe some of my losses)  She's the one always smiling too and ready to help anyway she can and to say good bye to paul and make sure we were all squared up with everything. Also to thank him for all he does for me before, during, & after my stay. He's such a busy guy like I mentioned but sat to talk with me a few minutes with my new friend Curtis (who is also a Executive slot host.) They both said why are you leaving so soon? Unfortunately lady luck wasn't good to me these past 4 days I said. Him & Paul both said call either of us when your coming back and we will make sure your trip goes as Smooth as always Scott. (Here again  I have to add I am a penny slot player only.) But the Rewards Center treats me like I'm a high roller.  I also used some of my points to get a voucher for a midnight snack at Subway. Nichol was closing up but stayed open to get my voucher. A BIG THANKS NICHOL!!!
  They also have a new program where they will match your slot club tier from another Casino. I tell you all this and ramble on a bit because I used to stay on the strip and did not get nowhere near the treatment I receive here at The Plaza. (It doesn't matter how much you spend. A few hundred or a few thousand) To them your just a number and here you are a name. That's why the Plaza will earn my business in April when I return, and there after. 
  Thanks EVERYONE at the Plaza for another wonderful trip and BOO to lady luck. I wish she would of been as nice as my friends at the Plaza. In closing I know most of us like to stay on the strip next to everything within walkin distance. But The Plaza is worth a try. I was skeptical at 1st too. But I tell you this I never left the hotel or Fremont street Experience. In my honest opinion the payouts are much better downtown. Thank for checking out my post. I know it's a little long.

-Chorizo burrito
-Carne Asada Fries

Our group started off with some guac- the goat cheese one. Now normally I'm not the biggest fan of goat cheese, but since the waitress said it was the most popular one, I decided to try it. It actually was pretty decent. We got to try the pineapple jicama guac later on with the entrees, and I must saw between the two, I prefer the pineapple jicama. I just like that extra crunch with the jicama in it. The only disappointing part was not being able to taste the pineapple. Don't be ""shiesty"" with the pineapple, peeps! The portions were good, but since I'm a guac lover I can never get enough. It was a good portion to be shared by 4-5 people. 

For the main meal most of us ordered from the taquitos section. To me...it just seemed like a self-make taco style dish, not really taquitos since it's not fried? Anyway, for the meats we got: 

machaca=I actually really like this one, marinated meat flavor was really good and super tender!! I used salsas from other dishes to compliment it. 

bistec= Not bad, it was tender and seasoned well. I've tasted better though.

carnitas= The flavors were not bad...but my gosh, so much sauce! Whenever we took a bite of the taco, the sauce/oil would spew out the other end. Warning= make sure you have your plate ready to catch the sauce on the other end....and it's probably not advisable to wear anything white while eating this dish (unless you are a super careful eater?)

My friend also ordered the lobster/shrimp empanadas. Those were yummy! And the sauce wasn't too rich or heavy. 

For dessert we ordered Mexican chocolate flan and the fried ice cream. The fried ice cream was huge! I liked the crunchy cornflake crust, and somehow the ice cream was not melting at all. I hate eating ice cream that's melted, so yay~the chef's did a good job. I couldn't even tell if the ice cream was really fried?! Hmmm...does that make it a little more healthy? lol- probably not...but a girl can dream, can't she? The chocolate flan was good, I liked the different spices they used. It has a heavier cinnamon flavor, than typical flan. 

Overall it was a good dinner! I'm just a little disappointed with the prices. It's pretty pricey, but I'm guessing that's because of the location? I would come back here though...but only for special occasions.",2013-09-16 20:15:20

Lately I've found myself in this area a lot for work - and normally I've been eating like a rabbit and foraging raw veggies, fruits and nuts during the day and then getting the bulk of my calories for dinner on weekdays.  But sometimes I go nutso and need something heavier to get me through the day.

For counting calories - this is one of my favorite meals to get on the fly.  A lettuce wrap cheeseburger (double double has too many calories) with all the veggies on it, and ketchup and mustard is about less than 300 calories.  And satisfies my cravings for heavier food.  Together with a huge unsweetened ice tea makes a really nice meal.

This is yet another restaurant where the surroundings and location don't necessarily say ""this place is excellent,"" but sometimes you have to jump in there.  Or, take the advice of a friend, which is how I found this place.

The dining room has always been quite clean, maybe made to feel moreso with the metal tables (they look like polished aluminum or stainless steel, very modern looking), and there is some decent art hanging on the walls.  The restrooms are situated such that you can see into the kitchen area if you head over to them, which to me says that the owner has some pride in the cleanliness there as well.

The food can be slightly salty now and then, but only if you're really looking to taste the salt.  I wonder if this might be due to variations in the ingredients going into the dishes, but either way I never did run into a ""this is too salty"" situation.

The good: its was more entertaining than i thought it would be. Comfy seats and interactive staff. The actors were good and the script definitely touched on all 3 movies. The guys that played Scott and Ash were great.

The bad: All the songs the red head (Ash's sister) performed were hard to hear. The words were all muffled. Not a talent issue but more so the songs are rushed through due to the tempo. Expensive drinks! $18 for a Tom Collins in a souvenir cup, which they don't ask you if you want. You've preferred to be given the option. Regular cup drinks are usually a bit less.

The ugly: The show started a half hour late. So instead of 11:30 they started seating people around midnight, show started around 12:15. This wouldn't be too big of a deal but the box office person made it a point to instruct us to get there super early to insure we'd be seated together.

The portions were large and the sushi pieces and rolls were inexpensive. The menu is slightly overwhelming because of all they offer. The service was good, the selection was plentiful, but the quality of the food was lacking (I guess you get what you pay for.)

I decided it was time I found out what all the fuss is over.  I'm now left wondering just what, exactly, all the fuss IS over.  Cabo has generated a lot of hype, but does not have the substance to back it up.

Given that it was a Saturday night, I assumed there would be a bit of a wait.  We were told we'd have a table in 10 minutes, and the hostess was pretty accurate.  After initially getting our names on the wait list, though, she could have done without immediately telling us we were in her way (in those words, exactly).  We made it to our table, and the waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink orders.  We inquired about the specials on the chalk board, only to find out those were from yesterday and no one got around to updating the sign.  We placed our orders from the regular menu.  And waited.   And waited. And watched other tables, who were seated AFTER us, receive their orders BEFORE us.  Mind you, half the restaurant is still empty.  After 45 minutes of waiting and inattentive service from our waitress, she explained there was a mix up in the kitchen.  She was unable (unwilling?) to compensate us in any way for such poor service.

The food finally arrived and I was unimpressed.  It tasted good, but not Food Network, everyone's-talking-about-it good.  The tacos were more lettuce than fish and the slaw was rather bland.

When you add it all up, and factor in the fact that the place is so loud it's impossible to do more than look at the other people at your table, I felt like I had wasted my money and the better part of my evening on a miserable experience.  Needless to say, I won't be giving Cabo a second chance.",2011-10-16 22:52:59

However, they lose stars from me because of poor service.  We probably ate $50-60 worth of stuff each so it's not like anyone was cheap-ing out.  

I ordered the rib-eye steak and I must admit that this was cooked to perfection.  The beef was juicy and it was actually really medium rare.  The caesar salad was also delicious.  

However, service was extremely mediocre.  They pretty much handed us our bill in the middle of a conversation we were having and as soon as we paid our bill, they stopped all their service altogether.  Everyone's water glasses were empty and they didn't even ask to refill them.  It was such an appalling ""let me take your money so that you can gtho"" attitude.  For a supposedly high-end restaurant, I find this extremely rude and I'm actually genuinely upset about this.  

In any case, although the food was good, it's not like I can't get that same quality somewhere else in Toronto (that also has great service).  Really not sure if I'm going to come back.

The smoked trout and bacon, goat cheese, and crab and corn guacamoles are so, so, so good.  The blood orange margarita is also fantastic.  Actually, all of the margaritas I've had here have been fantastic.  

If you still have room after the guacamole, the taquitos are the way to go.  If you don't know what a taquito is, think fajitas and you'll be pretty close.  You get a plate full of meat/veggies/sauce, and a side of corn tortillas to build your own tacos.  My favorites are the tuna (sushi grade, seared with avocado leaves and served extra rare), the coffee braised brisket, and the wild boar.  Like a previous reviewer said, everything is pretty spicy, so if you're sensitive to that sort of thing, I'd proceed with caution.  And when I say ""spice"", I don't just mean it'll burn your tongue, but that they use a lot of different spices.  So if you have a sensitive stomach, again, proceed with caution.  I don't have much experience with the ""entrees"", but from what I've seen I'd say stick with the taquitos.  

For everyone else, the food is delicious and the servers are always super friendly.  It's in a tiny old house, so you'll definitely need to make reservations.  I called first thing on a Tuesday (they're closed Monday) for reservations that Friday, and there were only 4 left when I called.  Something I stumbled on entirely by accident one time was that you can actually reserve the chef's table if there are only two of you.  I didn't know that's what we were getting when I made the reservations, but it was awesome.

I just have never had the patience to get into them. I think it's the pictures that distract me. Bear in mind that a piece of string can usually distract me. 

Samurai Comics is a little shop I drive by at least twice a day. I finally stopped by to investigate and lo and behold, wall to wall comic books. The newest issues of most any comic book you can imagine and a whole section of back issues. A selection of underground comics and 'zines are available for sale as well. All the comics were very neatly displayed and everything was very organized. They obviously care about what they're selling.

If your walls are covered in action figures (mint in package!) you can find your fair share of them here. There is also quite a large selection of Anime on DVD (used and new for sale) and Manga to check out. Trading cards are also available for those of you who are Yugi-Poke-Magic fans.

First, the good. The rice & beans were really good. Hot and delicious . 
Now for the Chicken. I have not had a Chicken that dry , ever. I practically choked on the first few bites, before giving up. My wifes dark meat, which should be moister, also was pretty dry. It was also not very hot, though that might have squeezed the last drop of moisture from the poor, abused bird at that point. 

So we tried the skin, to at least salvage the meal. it looked ok. No flavor. I mean, nothing?! Do they not have Salt in Columbia???  Compared to Pollo Viva (awesome), really disappointing. 

It was 1:45 pm, so I'm assuming they gave us chicken they had cooked for lunch and didnt sell.

We ordered the O&G grilled cheese - pretty decent grilled cheese, good size, well seasoned and great choice of cheeses. We also had the Vegan 2.0 panini, it was flavourful but lacked texture.

He showed up after 15 minutes asking if we were ready to order food and we never saw our waiter again until he brought us the bill.

Despite the terrible service, the flavour of the food was spot on. I ordered the rigatoni with brisket and pork Bolognese.

Build your own:  salads, sandwiches, and mac n' cheese (goat cheese and bacon mac n cheese, for example).  Obviously the bacon wrapped tots.  Lots of healthy options,too, if grease isn't your thing.  I'm a fan of the Latin Wedge salad, but, like a previous reviewer pointed out, adding chicken or other protein to your salad significantly bumps up the cost....pushing it past a typical lunch price point for me.  The Lemon Chicken Salad sandwich is great - a perfect sandwich for the summer.

I almost feel like they're trying too hard with the menu, though.  Presentation/execution both struggle a little.

It did not look like much from the hallway - noisy airport-bar atmosphere and whatnot, but they managed to seat all six of us despite appearing packed with no wait whatsoever.  Not only that, but the hostess actually asked how long we had until our flight - to ensure either that whatever we ordered would be ready in time, should there be concerns, or recommend things that would be ready in our time frame.  I was quite impressed!

We were seated at a long communal table which worked beautifully, we took over one end and the other side just rotated people as they finished eating.  I initially ordered the pineapple wine with mom to try but they were out of that (supposedly it is quite rare) so I had the sangria instead.  It is very strong in the citrus flavour but the berries at the bottom help balance it and I really enjoyed the drink.

For a meal I tried their daily quesadilla.  Yesterday's was chicken, roasted Anaheim peppers, roasted corn, asiago cheese, and topped with something similar to a chipotle mayo drizzle.  It came with a pepper/mango salsa that was delicious sprinkled on top of the slices.  I got to sample some of the homemade chips which were beautifully seasoned and had come with my mother's West Coast Wrap.

I also got to try a bite of the chicken fried trout.  I highly recommend that dish to anyone who likes seafood - it looks like it would be spicy with the chili and sriracha but the dill aioli and the buttermilk coating on the fish blend out the spice so you get the flavour of the spicy ingredients but not the heat.  And the coleslaw...Derek is not a coleslaw fan so he had a few bite then let mom and I fight it out for the rest...It was one of the best coleslaws I have ever had.  It was a simple cabbage slaw tossed in lime juice and vinegar in such a way that it disappeared as soon as we were allowed to eat it.

Take someone special here and you will not regret it! (See photos of food details!)

My boyfriend chose a pre-fix type menu which comes with an assortment of appetizers. The flavours were all amazing and such unique, complex layers. It's so well thought out that every bite has been pre-planned and arranged for you. The waitress takes her time to explain what each plate is and how to best enjoy the experience before leaving you to go to gastric heaven. They started us off with a shrimp appetizer over a broth gelatin and a shrimp head chip to finish that bite. Like everything we had that night, I was blown away by just how much flavour was infused to each and every bite. ""BLAND"" is NOT in their dictionary. Next we moved onto an array of fish and octopus with a wonderful side broth and delightful seaweed salad. The textures were so different across the board and yet, it was complimentary. And to end off the apps, we got a Miso Soup and some cold noodles in flavourful broth. I'm not usually a fan of cold noodles, but this one was very pleasant. Nothing over whelming, but just enough acidity and savory broth to make it enjoyable. 

Moving on, we had our sushi. The chef took his time to explain each fish he was presenting to us and I've got them all photographed (though more justice could have been done haha) below. The fish is fresh, stored well, treated with respect, and paired with whatever sauce or toppings the chef believes will enhance the natural flavours of the fish in the best light. Sometimes it was a dab of wasabi, a brush of flavoured soy sauce, sprinkle of sea salt, or brushed with the zest of a fresh lime. The chef was so friendly the whole time and they make you feel very comfortable there with the other guests sitting next to you. I don't believe I'll ever enjoy sushi the same way again. haha!

Lastly, we had our dessert. They had a candle in my dessert for my birthday and I thought it was just so perfect and sweet that the macaron on the plate was shaped as a heart :) Delicious from start to finish! I cannot rave enough about that tofu ice cream though. If you've ever had the tofu pudding dessert at a Chinese sweet shop, it tastes JUST LIKE THAT. creamy and milky and perfect. I could honestly get a whole tub of those and just watch some TV and devour it all.

Absolutely perfect from the moment you walk in to the food and to the moment you are finishing your meal. Be sure to book a bar seat so you can watch the chefs create the sushi! The staff are just incredible here and, like I said, just the most well rounded place. Comes with a hefty price so maybe not a weekly thing haha but it's definitely worth the experience. 

Thank you to my amazing boyfriend for this one of a kind dinner. I've lived in Markham forever and never even knew this place existed! So all you Yelper's out there, make sure you tell your significant other about Yelp. That way, they can plan a dinner you know you'll enjoy ;)",2017-07-24 16:24:07

They truly care about animals;  even the vets give kisses and play with them  showing tenderness when they are healthy & tremendous compassion when all avenues have been exhausted and the most humane thing possible is to hold your little one while they are put down. The staff is very accommodating, understanding, even sending sympathy cards signed by everyone if you experience a loss.  In the case of one cat they had been treating for a while who took a turn for the worse over a weekend and had to go to Emergency Vet, Dr Goldman called & expressed his sympathy and how much everyone enjoyed treating Ophelia.  

They offer alternative treatments such as chiropractic, advanced nutrition options and wholistic approach to treating each patient. I have never felt price gouged here, quite the contrary, there have been numerous occasions when each vet has said testing, expensive procedures etc were unnecessary. 

Another great thing is when you have an ailing pet, they allow you to visit and try to feed them but are very candid when decision making time is at hand. I think nothing of traveling from Summerlin to them & will always take my critters here. Recently, my 7 month old kitten broke a vase and cut her pad badly & they saw us 3x in a week with little notice and were able to help Antigone heal. Cannot recommend them enough and will be forever grateful for their true love of all animals!

Meal:
Course 1: Salad: The original spinning bowl salad.  It was pretty cool to see something like that .  The taste was good and it was enjoyable.

Course 2: Obviously, I chose the prime-rib and man was it enormous and savory!  The  put a little too much sauce on my rib but I didnt mind because they give you some sort of Yorkshire pudding to soak up all that sauce.  
On the side I had mashed potatoes and the creamy corn.  The mashed potatoes was mediocre and the creamy corn wasnt as tasteful as I thought it would be.

This place is bright and clean, it's a pay first and self-serve type of restaurant. There are a few seats on the first floor with more seating upstairs.

I came around 10pm and there was a short line up. Overall the wait was pretty quick- around 5 to 10 mins. The menu has alot of options and we decided to go with one of the top 10s - Meet fresh signature for take out.

The bowl includes shaved ice, grass jelly with taro balls and it's $8.7 + tax. I find it a bit pricey for the size, however it tastes pretty good. I would say it tastes better than its direct competitors in Toronto.

If I ever crave for taro balls or grass jelly dessert i would certainly come back.",2018-02-04 05:02:05

The first time, I went alone, and to save money I drove from L.A. to Phoenix and back in about 24 hours, and crashed with someone I met through Couchsurfing--on an armchair and ottoman, actually, no couch. That was fun and all, but I decided to use some Starwood Points last year and upgrade to The Phoenician. We were going to do the same thing this time around, but when we looked into booking, we noticed that The Phoenician went from a category 5 to a category 6 (sorry, this probably means nothing to you if you're not a Starwood member), making it cost the same number of points as The Canyon Suites. We decided to go for The Canyon Suites, and it was pretty damn nice.

The two properties are part of the same resort, with The Canyon Suites being a bit quieter and more tucked away, with nicer rooms and a dedicated pool. We took advantage of the Thirsty Camel at The Phoenician, and used both pools during our stay. We also took a walk around the cactus garden, which was pretty spectacular. We brought our own books, but if not we might have taken advantage of the well-stocked bookcase in the lobby. Our room was gorgeous, large and luxurious with a great bathroom and comfortable bed.

Service was top notch. The staff was super attentive and we got what felt like real VIP treatment the entire weekend. We were welcomed with a box of chocolates and other treats gathered from local chocolate and treat artisans. Staff greeted us every time we walked around the property. There was even a shuttle between The Canyon Suites and The Phoenician, but the distance was so short we would've felt stupid taking it.

I don't know that I can stay at this resort every time I'm in town (for one thing, I'm running low on Starwood points) but I'd love to come back for another desert getaway. If you want a luxury hotel in Phoenix, you can't really do better than The Canyon Suites.",2015-11-11 00:32:12

So, yesterday, along with the lovely Farrah A, I decided to do just that... we went to a late lunch at Olive Garden and guess what?  I'm here to tell you about it!

Yes, it is a chain, and yes - I had low expectations... but I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  The service was fabulous thanks to the hostess that opened the door for us when we entered and exited, and of course thanks to Tony, our waiter.  The bathrooms were clean and although the atmosphere is a bit on the sterile side, I'd rather have that than a dirty restaurant!

I went with the soup and salad - minestrone soup, and Farrah went with soup and salad - a creamy chicken and gnocci soup.  We also shared a mussels appetizer... I didn't love the breadsticks, and the mussels were a tad on the buttery side, but the soup and salad were both fresh and flavorful!  I had just one bowl of soup but several helpings of salad... and Tony didn't even flinch.  

Farrah informed me that the Olive Garden chefs go to Italy for training and upon checking out their website, I see she is correct!  Here's what it says on their site: ""Olive Garden's Culinary Institute of Tuscany is located in the 11th century village of Riserva di Fizzano. Every year Olive Garden chefs travel to our Culinary Institute to learn authentic cooking secrets from Italian Chef Romana Neri and Chef Paolo Lafata.""

Impressive, huh?

I just got home from dropping off some relatives at the Greyhound and I have to say I see major improvements!

- this place is much, much cleaner than I ever remember seeing it. Granted, I'm not eating lunch off the floors anytime soon, but it is a great improvement from every other time I've ever been here.

- the young lady behind the counter was friendly AND helpful. You could have knocked me over with a feather! lol I guess instead of being cashiers, everything goes through the kiosks now. The young lady helped us through the entire process of buying the proper tickets. 

- Now, this one is the biggie...they had 3 security guys guarding the door keeping the homeless and riff raff out of the place! Seems to be making all of the difference in the world.

As easy as it has been to bag on this place, I do have to give credit where it is due as far as the improvements they have made here. I may update further at a later time, but for all the years I have been coming here, this is the best I have ever seen it!

-It's a Super-Sport
-Plenty of equipment, free-weights and machines. 
-Squat/Power Rack with adjustable bars for heavy Rack Pulls. Except for LVAC, no other gyms have these hybrid Squat/Power Racks with adjustable bars that go low enough to do deep Rack Pulls.  
-Obviously, a great back gym with their Power Rack, but also a good chest gym with multiple flat and incline benches.

For the most part it is well organized and the quality of the items in the store are good. The name says it all because it really does feel like a hunt. You never know what you might find. 

Come in with an open mind and see what you can find. Pay attention to the date on the tag and see how long it's been there to see if you get a discount. 

I have a few issues with the store however. I've came back for items that I've seen and wanted to wait so that the new dates would kick in and the item would be discounted down. But instead of keeping the original sticker on they place a new sticker on that refreshes the date so it's still the same price and no discount! They got my hopes up thinking that it would be 25-50% off but they just put a new date on it and made it so it wasn't discounted. This has happened on multiple items. 

I've even found items with the original price tags from other retailers (Target) with prices that were cheaper then what Bargain Hunt was selling it for! That's not how bargains go if you ask me.

Chef Chris prides himself on ""sophisticated simplicity"" and that's exactly what you get here. Nothing too over-complicated. Nothing that seems to be trying too hard. Just good, well-thought out dishes. Period. 

I'm happy that they expanded their dining room. It takes away from the intimate feel a bit, but it makes it easier to get reservations at a reasonable time. 

Dinner starts off with a basket of fresh bread and whatever the special house-made butter is that night. Expect some interesting flavor combos like kale/honey. On my recent Avenue B visit I ordered the most tender melt in your mouth Hanger Steak that was served over a flavor explosion of mushroom mac and cheese ($35). Dessert was a croissant bread pudding with salted popcorn ice cream. Divine!

If there's nothing on the rotating chalkboard menu that catches your eye, do yourself a favor and order the Wagyu Meatloaf ($25). You may be thinking, ""Amy, $25 is a little steep for something my mom made for me as a kid."" Well, I don't know your mom, but I can guarantee her meatloaf sucked in comparison to this distinctive, delightful, enticing, exquisite dish. This meatloaf will change your life (or, at the very least, cause you to over-use adjectives).

This is the asian restaurants to end all restaurants. The variety is limitless. Don't be fooled, they do have there limitations. If you look at the menu closely you will notice there is no fresh fish or seafood items which are staples of asian food, however you will not be disappointed with the selection. They have a little of everything from the different provinces of China. Your head will spin when you walk in as you try to figure out what to order. Your best bet is to check out the menu at home online before going to the restaurant itself. You order cafeteria style and write down the numbers of your order. There is no gratuity which is nice, but don't expect the busboy who double as servers to help you out. There main job is to dump the food off at the table and take your number back. There is a fee of 1 dollar for each person for clean up and free tea. The cashier is quite friendly ad does not get overwhelmed even when the line is super long. We ended up trying a variety of dishes which you can see from the pictures. Here is a quick run down:
1. Smoked tea duck- sort of salty and dry unfortunately, but still tasty
2. Beef ribs with some sort of glaze- deep fried and a bit dry, but plenty of sweet sauce over it
3. Glazed pork- a hybrid dish that is similar to orange chicken. Again a bit dry on the underside
4. Fish fillet with veggies- tasty and a lighter dish. Cooked well, but the white fish is your typical asian stir fry fish
5. Salted egg coated shrimp- the egg was not salty at all, but the shrimp were cooked well and crunchy
6. Soup dumplings- pretty good, not sure if they are the freezer variety or if they make there own. The skin is on the thicker side, but this is expected in the midwest
In summary, I have tried tried asian food in China, Hong Kong, Thailand and this is by no means anywhere close. The food is good given the variety and the location in Central Illinois. The extensive menu is really different proteins with variety of ingredients. Often the meat is cooked in a wok with high heat and then a sauce is applied. Given the volume a lot of the meats were a bit overcooked and dry. If you have a large party it is great given no need for TIP, BYOB; but if you want real authentic asian food you will have to go to Chinatown!

Pros: super large menu, relatively good prices, BYOB, no gratuity (1 dollar service fee for table cleaning), free tea, large tables for groups

Cons: very busy, small parking lot, no real ""service"", food is a bit dry and overcooked

Hidden deals: Pay in cash for 5% off, I am sure this is for there own tax write off purpose......

-The meats were tasty (except the sausage which was too salty for me)
-The chocolate croissants were soooo good
-A fair amount of fresh fruit offered
-Yummy Cheses

The not-so-good:
-We waited in the lobby 5 minutes before being acknowledged/seated
-The hot foods from the buffet were wayy too salty- I wasn't able to take more than a couple bites of each (potatoes,  scrambled eggs, bacon)

Made our reservation for 5 on OpenTable and when we arrived, we were instantly seated. Our server got us waters while we waited for the rest of our group to arrive, then he went through menu and drinks with us. We ordered drinks and appetizers. While waiting for appetizers, they brought out baskets of bread (the pretzel bread was yummy!). We ordered Shrimp Cocktail and Seared Ahi Tuna for appetizers. I ate some of the tuna, which was amazing.

For main course, we each ordered a meat then a bunch of sides to share. I got the filet mignon. For sides, we got Mac & cheese, black truffle gnocchi, broccoli, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. I couldn't eat the gnocchi, but everything else was flavorful and delicious. Even the veggies had a unique flavor to them! We had leftovers, which we split up (somehow I ended up with a coworker's lamb, which I ate the next day and OH MY GOD I should have ordered lamb...). They bagged everything up for us and then we ordered desserts to share. We got the butter cake, flourless chocolate cake, and one other dessert (I forget!). The butter cake was good, but not my favorite. I loved the chocolate cake, though it was super rich. So yummy.

As far as service, our server was fantastic and attentive. When we first were seated and only ordered waters to start, I think he was a little ""eh"" that we might not be big spenders (and therefore big tippers...), but as we ordered more and more he seemed to friendly up a bit. He also had an assistant who helped quite a bit and constantly refilled our waters and cleared plates as needed. 

The ambiance is nice, but it is in a mall (though a pretty nice mall). The main seating areas kind of overlook the mall, so it's a bit ""meh"" but don't let that take away from your experience. The food was great, the service was great... the price was definitely expensive. I'm sure you can eat here without it being as pricey as we made it, but we ordered a LOT of food and drinks.

It's owned by the same people that run Globefish, which is conveniently located beside each other. The parking lot is tight but woah, Muku is buuuuuuuusy. We got there around 5:30pm on a Friday evening and there already was a crowd of people lined up.

There's two lists to put your name down on - one for tables and one to sit at the ramen bar. Choose wisely, then breath in the aromatics (don't worry, the wait is bearable). Their system would be infinitely better if they were grouping people based on table size. Seriously, I know first come first serve is usually the way to go but when you put two people on a four spot, that's a waste of real estate, especially considering their capacity. Oh well.

The menu is purely ramen (the way it should be) and you can choose from three broths - tonkatsu, miso and shoyu. Each broth has a choice of regular, spicy and then add ons (extra meat, wontons, etc.).

- 2x Tonkatsu chashu wonton ($12.95) + set ($3.00) - my buddy and I ordered the same tonkatsu chashu wonton ramen - for an extra $2.00, you get five extra slices of chashu pork and two wontons. Muku's tonkatsu broth had depth and was very flavourful. Both friends and I agreed that we could easily slurp up a bowl on it's own, after all, this is their speciality broth. Made from pork bones and a soy-based sauce, you'll want to dive right in. Bathe in it even. The ramen came topped with fresh green onions, young corn and a slice of naruto (Japanese fish cake). The noodles had a nice chewy bite to it and stayed that way till the bitter end. I have to say, I enjoyed Muku's tonkatsu much more than Menyatai's but Menyatai wins hands down with their chashu. Both have their strengths but are winners in my book.

We also added the $3.00 set menu which gives you your choice of a small rice bowl (beef, chashu and unagi) and salad. I went with the unagi, which came with two pieces of tender, fatty eel pieces. One more would have been perfect. The salad was light and refreshing with a sweet salad dressing on top. It's definitely worth adding onto your meal.

- Miso ramen ($9.95) - my friend went with the miso, which is made of chicken and fish broth and Muku's original miso paste. I sampled a bit of the miso broth and I definitely was a bigger fan of the tonkatsu. It really depends on what you want though. The miso ramen came with chashu, fresh green onions, corn kernels, bean sporuts, bamboo shoots, carrots and nori.

I'm still baffled by how many good spots there are in Calgary to get your ramen fix in. Seriously, soooooo good. Ramen done right. Sit at the ramen bar and watch the one ramen maestro/chef work his magic. It's unreal, it's literally one man doing everything in the kitchen.",2015-03-12 16:39:47

The rice they served with the food was not basmati...very clearly long grain white rice. Not a big deal, but just something that was noticed. I also not a huge fan of the disposable tableware. Just not very ecofriendly or conscious.

Tried this place 3 times and all 3 times it's been great.

The menu is great, they offer a good assortment and combinations of cheeses, bacon, mushrooms, and other gourmet toppings. Let me be clear, this place still has a ways to go, for starters, there needs to be more tables and a proper bar added. There should also be a lettuce wrap option or gluten-free bun option as well. 

BUT, the food quality is good. All burgers, salads, fries are made-to-order. Would definitely go here again if I want to dine-in for a gourmet burger.

I would suggest just stick with dim sum especially their Early Bird and Later Afternoon Specials which I been for a few times and always been excellent.

For the Good:

- Lobster at $11.80/lb cooked whatever way requested. Lobster can be as small as 2.5 lb and that is perfect for 2 people to share (I can eat the whole thing myself)
- I received a voucher during dim sum for a free Double Boiled Shark Fin Soup with Vegetable and Chicken ($16.80). I am not into shark fin but dinner mate thought it was the best item we ate during our meal
- The dessert pastry which is complimentary were really good

For the Bad:

- I now officially ate the worse Sweet and Sour Pork in my life. So bad I feel like just ordering this dish and make the Head Chef and Head Waiter just to eat and finish this dish so they can experience the same thing. The batter was heavy and hard, the pork was just basically chunks of fat! I ate a few pieces and ended up splitting them out!

- Food was mostly salty and loaded with MSG. I was thirsty the whole night
- One of the waiter kept swearing in Chinese behind the partition and the customers can clearly hear every words he said and Richlane supposed to be a higher end restaurant at least according to the price they are charging?

Extremely disappointing is my comment. 

Having tried Mastro's in multiple cities, even Mastro's City Hall a week ago in Scottsdale, and Mastro's Ocean Club in Newport Beach and Vegas on multiple occasions, this experience was a disappointment. We were 5 and 3 of us ordered Florida Grouper. (Probably should be off the menu or there's a chef issue). 

Overcooked, not fresh tasting, grouper is a real disappointment. The 2 people who ordered steaks were happy. I have had the sashimi grade ahi at Ocean Club in other cities and it was 5 star---I probably would not order it here. 

Further, the lobster mashed potatoes were bad. It's really hard to screw this dish up but the lobster was huge lumps and the pool of butter made this look like something out of a 1995 Paul Prudhomme cooking show. 

$6 to park, not horrible, except I dropped about $600 on a really bad meal. I didn't want to screw up the birthday celebration, so I was polite. Later, we all concurred this place doesn't rate.

The blt was broken over cooked bacon bits, the thinest sliced tomato and a leaf of lettuce. How can one screw up a blt is beyond me. Now to the soup that arrived 10 minutes after my sandwich and uneatable. It was like someone took beef base added some onions then filled the cup with salad croutons. I am guessing they microwaved it allowing the croutons to disintegrate like mush. My server was pleasant but the kitchen staff were yelling and seemed a lot of horse play going on, must not have had a manager on duty. Now to top this visit off the large cook, I think I heard his name Steven yelled a few times, with dirty uniform walks to a few tables to shake hands and talk with guests only to go back to touching food in the kitchen without washing his hands. While I have been here 4 other times without problem and even giving them a Yelp of 5 stars, This visit made me take back 3 stars and it will be hard to come back anytime soon.

The pizza is fairly pedestrian, freshly made but nothing to write home about, definitely a little bit on the boring side, especially for a mom-and-pop type of operation. I'll pass.

The souvlaki on a pita however, is solid, especially the fresh pita itself and the toppings, but sadly the Souvlaki meat is only okay, in both the pork and chicken variety.

First, the good.  The space is quite lovely, with a tasteful floral motif.  We sat on the patio, and the heaters kept us comfy, even on a cool January day in Vegas.  The patio was even far enough from the pool to keep you from getting drenched by overly enthusiastic kids doing cannonballs.  But that's where the really good part ends.

My wife and I both ordered Eggs Benedict, and we agreed that we have had much better.  The eggs were perfectly cooked, but the hollandaise was skimpy and the English muffins were dry and a bit hard.  The hash browns were definitely second rate - sort of a brick of (riced?) potatoes that elevated creativity over flavor.  And by ""creativity,"" I mean I have never seen anything quite like it.  Also, while $20 is not totally outrageous for Eggs Benedict (especially at the Wynn/Encore), for that price couldn't they have put a little slice of orange or sprig of parsley on the plate to dress it up a bit?  It all seemed kind of sparse.  Our friends both ordered omelets.  I didn't see them projectile spitting their meal across the patio, but they weren't exactly raving about the dish either.  And both of them left their ""hash browns"" untouched.  

Since this was to be my only meal for the day, I also ordered a bowl of the roasted tomato soup (my attempt to convert breakfast into brunch), which was just fine.  Good tomato flavor, and a touch of tasty garnish.

Our server was very pleasant, when she was visible.  Which was not often.  It took much too long from seating to taking our order, and from clearing the table to bringing the check.  Fortunately, our friends are exceptional conversationalists.  But as it turns out, the fact that they were staying at the Wynn was the only reason to eat at Jardin.

To get it out of the way, this is not ""fine pastry"" or truly a café. After all, they only have daifuku and one dorayaki (which is like a dry pancake).
I am not sure a daifuku is a pastry to begin with, but for Sasaki to qualify as a fine pastry shop/café/patisserie they need to have something more than just daifuku, tea and water.
They do have a seating area where the former J Town video shop was, but it is open to the sushi shop and is very hospital-like fluorescent bright so it is not a pleasant place to sit and eat... daifuku! They really need to soften the lighting. Along with the white walls it is like standing at Wal-Mart (shuddering).
I think these places are just called daifukuya.

With that said, the daifuku is really good. You can get daifuku (and dorayaki) next door at By The Sea and at Heisei (and many other places in town) but Sasaki's is fresh. The daifuku is soft and quality-wise a cut above the refrigerated ones elsewhere. It is delicious and soft.
I actually don't like anko so picked up the sakura and goma (sesame) ones and can vouch for the quality.

You know how you go to an izakaya like Kushi Sake Bar and notice that everything is burnt, cooked wrong, full of Korean hot sauce and has the wrong ingredients because the Korean waitresses, staff and owner are just faking it (to the many Chinese-Canadian and other Canadian customers who don't know any better and are just impressed by the samurai figures on the shelf)? Sasaki is not that. here you received authentic daifuku mocha.

Each daifuku is $2.50. They are given to you in a personalized plastic container and I am sure the little wrappers they sit on come from Japan too and cute.

Speaking of 'cute' you can tell why this place is getting the hype and all the 5 stars. It is like Sweet Jesus. As long as something is new and photo-worthy people need to fill their social media accounts with something and hype anything like these shops up with photos of something they consider exciting because it is new.

I love places where you can tell that the chef has put an effort to stand out or be creative, and this restaurant gets 5 stars for that. They have a varied menu including a tapas style one and everything I've had has been great.

The scones are to die for, the farmer's skillet is great and not too heavy, the sweet and salty lemon and egg fried things (sounds weird but so good) are great, the candied bacon is good even for someone like me who can't stand bacon, and the list goes on. The only complaint from my friends about their food when we came was that the eggs benedict was disappointing.

Upon arrival and requesting to be seated in the back so that I wasn't in the front under the florescents and throngs of travelers walking by, the reaction from the hostess was one of bewilderment and unhappiness, as she didn't want to seat us in what was supposed to be closed section, even though there were already people there. The excuse was that they were understaffed too. Not a very good impression to give to a new customer, but we ended up there anyway, go figure.

SERVICE: our server, while she seemed a little frazzled, tried her best to be very attentive. Maybe it was the holidays or the short staffed situation or that she was possibly employed by the airport rather than directly by the restaurant that made her unhappy, who knows. Another server, maybe from the bar, poured my wine and spills a little in the process on the table, but had no desire to wipe it up. Really? You want me to clean up after your mess?

FOOD: I was hoping that they would have the same menu as their other restaurant and was looking forward to ordering the Dixie pan-fried chicken, but it wasn't on the menu. So I opted for the meatloaf instead. Unfortunately, both the meatloaf and mashed potatoes were barely lukewarm and the broccoli was literally COLD and very under cooked (and I like crunchy veg); there was no way this dish came out of a hot pan or pot recently. And the meatloaf was dry and overcooked, lacking any kind of juiciness or color, just a block of brown meat in very little sauce. My dining companion's burger was hot, so I'm assuming my dish died in the window waiting for his dish. I wanted to send it back, but since our server didn't check on us for quite a while later and my companion was almost done with his burger, I didn't bother. Besides, the clock was ticking on my parking.

We dine out a lot and we have our local favorites so it's been a long time since I've tried a new restaurant and was very disappointed. It's not a great experience when you feel like you are being punished when you have done nothing wrong.",2014-12-24 16:36:18

Stopped in yesterday for the s'mores milkshake. This was my first visit to Beckett's Table and I've been wanting to try it ever since I heard a review about their chocolate covered bacon! The chocolate covered bacon is served as part of their s'mores dessert. For Arizona Dairy month they have made this dessert into a milkshake.

The milkshake was tasty but just ok in my opinion. I think it had one or two too many flavors going on for my preference. It had the standard s'mores ingredients of marshmallow, chocolate, graham crackers and also had an addition of bacon, caramel and peanut butter. I think if the peanut butter had been left out it would have been way better! (I like peanut butter but it just seemed to take away from the other delicious flavors instead of add to them.) 

The part of the shake I was looking forward to the most was the chocolate covered bacon! Sadly, the piece that came with the shake tasted burnt. (This coming from someone who likes their bacon very well done!) But when we mentioned it to our server he was very nice and brought us out two more pieces of chocolate covered bacon to make up for it. And those ones tasted better. =)

Speaking of the service...it was great. This is the reason for the 4 stars. The atmosphere is lovely. They are very attentive on filling up your water glass and making sure you enjoyed everything. It was great till the end, when we wanted to get our check...which took a while. But I don't hold that against them...our server seemed to have too many tables to look after. 

I hope to stop in again to try their food when I have more time.",2012-06-07 18:11:34

I literally could not handle the sound level of the music. My first move was to rummage through my purse to see if there was anything to stick in my ears. For some reason, I actually had ear plugs in my purse. I guess when you turn 30, you just start carrying crap like that around. Unfortunately, my boyfriend does not carry ear plugs or a man purse to put them in. So our second move, was to go outside on the patio. When people started smoking around us, we were forced back inside ... because smelling like smoke is now something I avoid like the plague. Then we sat on a bench and decided that if we were just going to sit there and talk to each other, we might as well go home. 

Now that is sad. 

I would definitely recommend this place to see a band, but for the love of God, the music in the front room is so loud it hurts. It's just not worth the hearing damage.

We went up to the hostess and told her we were a party of 5 wanting to do the dine and play. She said it would be a 20-30 minute wait and we said it was fine. She didn't ask for our name or anything so my husband had asked her if she needed our name and she was like oh yeah and grabbed a random paper. She took our name down and our number and said they'll call when a table was ready. So we walk around outside for a bit and when the 30 minutes was up we came back and checked in with the hostess. We waited another 10 minutes then we were finally sat. It seemed like they were short on people. We were sat for quite a bit when a manager finally took our order. The food was ok. We got the nachos and pizza. After that whole process, we finally got our game cards so the kids could play. Nearly all the machines and games were in use. You kind of had to stand by the game you wanted to play and wait for whoever was using it to finish so you can play it next for sure. There was a good selection of games for the small space.

He was due for a bath and the staff here were very good about explaining all the features of their u-wash area.  Very well stocked retail area and the staff have obviously been trained in customer service.  I'll definitely return.

Well, returned yesterday to give ""my bud"" another wash.  Couldn't remember the exact location so checked Yelp to relocate.  After reading some of the newer negative reviews i went in looking for issues. Perhaps an accurate point on one was about wet floors.  Hmmmmm.  Open wash tubs with lots of k9's shaking.  Yup!  Wet floors.  We solved the issue for Chester by putting one of the towels they gave us down on the floor so he wouldn't slip when getting out of the tub.  Now granted there might be some different non-slip flooring that could be installed, and that might not be a bad idea, but this is not an issue for us.

The staff were once again very attentive and repeatedly checked to see if we needed anything else during our wash/dry drill.  And yes, they are well trained in sales evident by once asking if we needed any food or treats to take home.  If you get put off by this, get a life!

As much as I want to give this place 5 stars I can't. Here's why...

Negatives

·         Parking is horrible; give yourself at least 15 mins to look for parking. Only few spots in the front and the rest are in the back (Not that good since its dark at night)
·         Be careful if you have little kids playing in the American Ninja Warrior area. Some of the padding doesn't cover the whole bar.
·          Be careful cause there's a lot going so pay attention to your kids.
·         They don't let you use your own socks, you can buy them for $4 or go barefooted.
·         Hard to find staff around the area
·         Dodgeball area: It's mixed of little kids & teenagers so be careful.

Positives

·         Lots to do for all ages
·         Favorite things to do; dodge ball, obstacle course, basketball hoop & trapeze stunts.
·         Great seating areas for parents
·         They have great birthday party areas
·         Great prices $13 adults & $10 kids

Tips

·         Check inn on Facebook or Instagram to say $1
·          Be cautious about your little ones since this is a great place for high energy teenagers.
·         Be ready to be tired lol

To be exact row 1 seat 6 so no cup holders. 2 Bavarian pretzels and a beer was about $12.00. The summer weather was super hot and sticky due to a storm forming towards the end of the game. The mini games between team pitches are fun to watch the children give it their all. For example, untying a frozen shirt, air guitar challenge,  the horse jumper race, the mascot base race, the spin your head on the bat race and that's all
I remember. 

There's this old man that plays the trumpet, the triangle and a tambourine during the game which made it entertaining.

I think everyone in our group had a great experience and enjoyed the food thoroughly. 

For starters we had the buffalo carpaccio and the quesadilla del dia. The buffalo carpaccio was amazing, flavorful and just the right amount of pickled shallot to balance off the the flavored. As for the quesadilla, I fell in love with the chess that was drizzled over the tortilla. 

The salad was the highlight of the dinner, our table unanimously agrees that it's amazing. It was the Stetson chipped and I highly recommend every one to get it. It's so complex in flavor yet wonderfully mixed together, between the crunchy, the soft, the creamy and all the textures you could think of. Just try it. 

I ordered the grilled swordfish, and it was very well prepared, as the sauce gave it that smoothness that it deserved, and the Peruvian potatoes along with the cauliflower were to die for. 

As I thought everything was done, spoons for desserts were presented and we get this bike size chocolate brownies  that's were covered with chocolate crumbles and set on a swoosh of chocolate sauce.

We were pretty full from eating elsewhere but told them if they would bag our sample we would eat it at home. They were more than happy to do this for us.

I asked them as far as other locations were concerned. This is the only one in the city and it is Greek themed. When we finally were able to have our ""doggie bag"" I was pleased that they gave us a small gyro which is one of their specialties, along with lemon chicken soup, and oyster crackers. Believe me it did not disappoint. It was just enough for a light meal later.

They have a rewards program that if you buy 7 sandwiches or salads then you get the 8th one free. When i got home I had a chance to review the menu in detail. the serve a vegetarian gyro, specialty burgers and specialty sandwiches along with sides. Everything is ala carte however, you can get a side of fries and coleslaw at a reduced price if you order a sandwich.

Breakfast items are available as well which does includes omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, pancakes, French toast, and two eggs your way. Expect to pay a little more since you are at the airport but they are on par with some of neighborhood diners I have visited. 

Since it is part of the fast casual approach don't expect table service however, there is a food court eating area behind the row of fast food eateries on the left side of the center core.

They do offer egg white substitutes if you have health issues. The only thing I found lacking on their menu was desserts. All they offer is rice pudding. Don't expect to see those gigantic pies and cakes you would normally find.

Still they have a good variety of Greek fare selections which is a novel approach to casual dining whether you plan to eat there or take it with you in flight.

We had the garlic edamame: pretty damn good! It could have used more sauce but the flavor was good and the edamame was cooked well. 
We had nigiri sweet shrimp: this was SO good. The shrimp was VERY sweet and BIG and the shrimp heads were HUGE. Good stuff!

One such item clearly listed it was spicy in the menu. I felt sorry for our server but he at least didn't allow himself to be bullied. 

We were as easy to handle as we could make ourselves. There were constant checks on how we were doing by our server, the busboy, and other servers. We shared a sake and it was delicious. We ordered four or five times throughout our time and weren't kept waiting for too long at least. There were some regulars next to us on the right side, a pair of friends who I could tell were regulars (not like the other party) because the servers all said hey to them and knew their orders. They also ordered the classy, expensive, simple stuff. Because it was our first time, I kept it pretty basic and tried a little of everything--a few fancy rolls, a basic one, grilled shishkabobs, nigiri, and sashimi. I wasn't disappointed.  

Excited to come again. Highly recommend this place for the freshness and vast selection.",2017-10-18 21:43:46

I was also considering checking off ""No"" under the tips section when they asked if there was table service. That's pretty bad. The place was packed. If they would have known that 3 Yelpers would give them a bad review, I'm sure they would have chosen a different table to completely ignore. 

There was a guy who was manning the pizza oven, or pretending to, that almost didn't even let us sit at the only empty table in the joint because he ""had a reservation coming in."" I feel bad for the people that actually reserved a table there. I think there was only one waitress for the whole place. She didn't even look at us. I'm sure that other customers were much more satisfied than we were... but they weren't being ignored.

I agree with fellow Yelper's M. and M. on all counts. I want to believe that this place could actually be good. This is why it gets 2 stars. I have hope.

I have ordered takeout from this location three times and have not had an issue.

The only complaint I might have is that they ask you to stand right in front of the kitchen area around the servers pass to wait for your food after you order, which to me is pretty awkward. I know just stand by the sweets area to get out of the way.

When we started frequenting IJ many moons ago, it used to be a dark crammed space.  On our recent visit, we were shocked to see how brightly lit the space was.  The dining room went from being too dark to too bright.  Why not find a middle ground where you can still see you food but don't feel like you're sitting in a TV studio?  

The skewer combo is a good deal and comes with 5 assorted skewers char-grilled to yummy goodness but if you're not a fan of ""different"" types of meat, I'd opt for a la carte for the skewers.  In our combo, there were chicken yakitori (the most standard skewer with teriyaki glaze...did not rock my boat), gizzard (still too chewy...I prefer the way Koreans stir-fry their gizzards better), chicken wing (salt only seasoning is a ok!), chicken breast bone (salt only and my favorite) and one other skewer I can't recall.  We ordered the tongue skewer which came out too chewy for my liking again.  

We had an a la sashimi combo (good selection and excellent quality, better than Taro's fish in my opinion) and manila clam ramen (the scene stealer!  was light and sooooooooo good.  Super umami!)  We also had the spinach appetizer and takowasa to start our meal.  

We had a chance to sample some beers from Japan (I forget the brand but it came in a little rotund bottle) which were also great.  I liked the fact that the staff paced our meal perfectly, only bringing out enough food at a time not to crowd our table or rush our dinner.

First, every visit during Hot Light Hours gives each person in the door a free glazed donut.  Why, you ask?  Because it's like crack, or in this case, KracK.  Eat one, and you'll never be the same again.  

So basically I get those free sample donuts every week, and I carry a KK card, which is for 1 free dozen every 10 dozen you buy.  In addition, Tuesday night is Double Punch Night!  :D  Yaaaay :D  So, every Tuesday, I'll be down at my KK, and get a Free Dozen every month.  

While the hot, moist, fluffy, deliciously perfect glazed donuts are the star of the show, many other kinds of donuts are quite good as well.  My mother likes the sugar donuts, my brother likes the Chocolate custard filled, I like the maple.  Every one of them is great, just try to warm them for 7 seconds in the microwave, and they'll be even better!

Let's get down to the food: The chicken in the chicken tikka masala is plainly marinated separately from the sauce and combined later, so the sauce doesn't really permeate the chicken well. The lamb is cooked well but isn't the best quality meat. The tamarind flavored lamb needs a little more garlic or tomato or some acid. The cauliflower appetizer was AMAZING and I would eat 3 servings of it for dinner any day of the week. Their potli samosas are special because of the beet chip and yummy dipping sauce. High five for appetizers!

As for the dranks: good wine selection, but none of the cocktails were interesting enough to pique my curiosity. 

Didn't bother with dessert this time because it was so terrible last time. I'll probably stick to that approach in the future.

Food: The meal started off with a bang.  We started with Mozzarella (Buratta) which was fantastic.  The Buratta is ""infused with honey and truffle cream.""  Neither the honey nor truffle cream were particularly pronounced but it didn't matter, it tasted great! There were generous portions of cheese too.  

Next came the meatball which was really great and was absolutely the highlight of the meal.  It was perfectly textured both inside and outside.  The centre was quite moist and not crumbly or dry at all.  The seasoning was great too. 

Next came the mains.  I was debating whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars because the main meal itself was disappointing.  I was looking forward to the pastas the most because of the homemade noodles and because the appetizers were fantastic.  We ordered the Capri and Bolognese.  First off, the fettuccine noodles in both cases were quite soft; I really like my noodles al dente, or at the very least, a bit chewy.  Second, the Bolognese tasted fairly generic as far as meat sauces go.  It was neither rich nor meaty.  The Capri itself wasn't too bad.  There were generous servings of PEI muscles.  Scallops were small and there weren't many pieces of squid though.  Flavouring was OK but lacked any significant punch.  Portion sizes were pretty good 

Service: waiter was nice and attentive but the meals took a while to arrive.  We waited about 30 minutes for the main course which isn't terrible, but also not great either.

As far as the restaurant is concerned, It can get pretty loud in here.  There's a DJ at least on the evening we went blaring various pop songs.  The hipster lightbulbs are also present here.  There's a patio outside as well.  My suggestion would be to make a reservation and as a tip, if OpenTable is full, give them a call and they can usually squeeze you in.

Overall:
Mozzarella Buratta: A-
Meatball: A+
Capri: B-
Bolognese: C+
Bathrooms: A+
Service: B
Ambiance: Loud

With a bottle of wine, appetizers, meals, tax and tip, the total was about $140.

Bottom Line: Scaddabush really hits a lot of high notes; the apps are great and it's nice to go to an unpretentious Italian restaurant with decent prices.  There really is a case to be made for restaurants that fill the void between East Side Marios and Buca and I think this restaurant can fill that void.  If it weren't for the disappointing mains, it would have been perfect.  It can get quite loud here, so I'd avoid this place if you want an intimate dinner.",2014-07-19 14:05:30

I should say that I'm not vegetarian or vegan and I don't typically care if the food I'm eating uses fake meat, I only care that it taste good and on that note, I find the food here quite delicious.  

The real surprise to me was the fake shrimp we ordered - you would never mistake it for real shrimp but it's an admirable approximation.  One person in my party has moderate shrimp allergies and she was able to eat this without any allergic reactions and she was so happy.

First red flag was how difficult it was to make an appointment; not because they were booked up but because it was very difficult to get in touch with someone (set up an appointment online but I didn't receive confirmation; called a couple different days with no answer, sent an email then finally received a reply). 

Second red flag was arriving and being told that the woman (Trish) I specifically made an appointment with was 'running late' and could I please work with another stylist (Brittany). 

There is a rocker-type ambiance to the place: purple walls, leather chairs, definitely not a serenity spa, especially when there's another stylist goofing around with her loud, foul-mouthed boyfriend. The place - from start to finish - was very unprofessional and I felt like I was back in high school. 

Third red flag was finding out while chatting that my sweet, friendly, young stylist just recently received her cosmetology degree which would explain why I needed to point out that my haircut was not even, and why my hair was flat ironed while still damp; my heart was stopping as the smoke from my hair was rising (hair is still recovering from that; and no offense to Brittany who's a doll, just emphasizing inexperience). 

I see this place has a lot of great reviews and all I can figure is that they're staged or made by people who have the stylists come to their location, because the actual salon and associated stylists are, in the words of Yelp... 'Eek! Methinks not'.",2011-10-14 17:37:04

Holy crap...!

I'm dedicating this paragraph to these magical balls. One of my favorite things I've ever tasted! I'm a huge fan of French onion soup and these dumplings were better than any soup I've ever tried! Once the soaked bread hits your tongue, you then taste the sweet onions and hot soup come in and then all that melted cheese all over them and a crispy crouton for texture! My goodness! Please don't skip this item when you come here...

So the menu is a lot of fun and inspires you to share small plates. We also tried the Maine lobster rolls. I loved the baked roll itself but I didn't care for the filling that in my opinion had too many crunchy components. The scallops and charred corn were orgasmic with a great Spanish twist and the Garganelli pasta dish with sweet & spicy bolognese and whipped ricotta rocked my world! 

It was V Day so we also had to end on a sweet note. Decided to try the Kygo cloud nine s'mores and let me just say that I made a loud sound after the first bite! Another holy crap moment! So rich & decadent and that marshmallow cloud will live on in my dreams forever!

My most recent visit here included members of my family.  My family not being from the city have heard me talk about this place so much that when they came down they insisted on me taking them there.  

Of course when we arrived there was a wait, I told them that most likely there would be, not only because it's so good, but because we were going at a busy time.  I informed them about the system they have where they text you when you table is ready.  Walked up to the podium, gave my information and decided to check out the shops nearby.  

Good thing we were only right next door, because what happened next totally floored me.  When I first went in and gave my name we were told that our wait would be anywhere from 30-45 minutes because we had a party of 5 adults and a child.  While we were browsing the racks in the store my phone rang, not knowing the number I did the typical thing and ignored it.  My phone than rang again and I told my family that I should answer it.  Burgatory went the extra mile here.  It was them that called me and told us our table was ready, not even ten minutes into our wait!

The produce section is pretty extensive for a discount grocery story. Yucca, cactus, horseradish. Although the greens were a little wilty they did carry a large variety from chard, kale, various greens, etc. This is the reason I didn't go 5 stars but I will say the prices can not be beat!

Oranges $.32 a lbs seems to be the cheapest in the valley. So were a lot of the other fruits and vegetables although not much in the way of organic.

They have an incredibly large bulk section for those of you who have lots of mouths to feed nothing say staying in budget then buying in bulk and a huge variety from grains to candy to cereals. I only went in for fruit no flesh of any kind over these 2 weeks. Oh strawberries juicy sweet 2lbs $1.88 cha-ching.

Last but not least they carry a variety of non dairy products mostly silk but coconut milk $2.58!?!?! There is no where in the valley cheaper. Now I don't care for original sweet I prefer no sugar added and So delicious is my brand of choice but again for the price you can't beat it.

I cruised through the store looking at other items and I can say beer and wine are fairly priced the wine selection is of the drinkable variety not the selective variety but Cupcake under $9 a bottle, 12 pack of Negra Modelo less than $12 I think these are very competitive prices. Now you do have to bag your own groceries so moms take the kids because nothing says family bonding time like bagging groceries. Plus your husband needs an activity to manage :)

Bottom line if you haven't been to Winco I advise everyone in the valley to go at least once to see what food prices at a quality grocery store could and should be. Walmart step up your game and get competitive!

I also got the meat combination plate. It came out beautifully decorated. Each of the meats had a nice sweet caramelization without compromising the flavor of the meat. The blackened chicken was my favorite. It had so much juicy flavor that I couldn't help but to get down on it with my hands.

The service was fine though I don't believe I'd apply the adjective ""friendly"" though I've seen it mentioned in many other reviews.  Maybe it was just too early for our server to be personable.

We started with the deep fried tofu with fresh garlic.  Not bad, but I'd never order it again because it was just meh.

There could have been some miscommunication about what we wanted, but at first we had a waiter who was going to take drink orders and then they never came back so we just went to the bar to order. 

Anyway, this morning's brunch made up for it. First off, I LOVE the space. I love the plants hanging and along the bar. The fresh green mixed in with the wood and metal is really nice. I'm also a sucker for cool logos and incorporating the designs around the place, which Suffolk Punch/Hyde does really well. We got there at noon and had no wait getting a table. Two of us opted for the omelet and one got the French toast (which looked amazing). Omelet was also yummy! The side was fingerling potatoes, which are actually just French fries but they were pretty good as well. I got a side of bacon- DELICIOUS. I will say the coffee was $3 and then there was an additional charge for another cup. They brewed it fresh, but kind of expected a coffee refill to be free.

The service was slower than normal, which was odd since the restaurant wasn't busy. The table we were situated at felt really crammed up against the window. Everyone's meal came out at different times, and mine came out the latest. I felt super rushed as the other half waited to order desserts.

Low lighting makes it seem even fancier - they even put on the menu that you can't use your cell phone (broke that rule to check in). The food was outstanding! We ordered the cornbread app (sweet, crumbly goodness) and the dip duo (guac and spicy queso dip) with very few chips. They were kind enough to bring us more chips on request at no additional charge. For dinner most of us ordered the rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes. Huge portions at only $17/each - pretty good deal for fine dining! Drinks were standard. Margarita was a little weak for $10 - lots of ice.

The loss of two stars is a result of terrible, grumpy service. Our waitress, Vanessa K, put on the smile, but you could tell she was really hating her job last night. I don't know why - we ordered plenty of food and drinks, you'd think she'd be excited for the tip? Not so much. She was very short spoken with our group and at no point offered to do anything for us, we constantly had to request service.

There are few things in life as simply delicious as HDOS. I mean, all it is is a super delicious corndog, fries, fresh lemonade. There's no culinary fusion magic or haute cuisine deals going on here. Why? Because who needs that when you're in a rush and the food is this good!

Every time I come here, I find that I'm at war with myself: part of me wants to be smart and just get one hot dog, and part of me doesn't care and wants one hot + cheese on a stick + large lemonade. The latter choice usually wins out. How can it not?!

I'd like to go into detail here about one of my favorite culinary creations: Pepper Jack on a stick. It's the most brilliant idea since the taco, as far as I'm concerned. What they do is take a pepper jack block, dip it in batter, then fry that joker. What you get is a delicious, hot, crispy outer layer of batter and a delicious, hot, melty core of pepper jack.

No food. Just a broken popcorn machine that hadn't been cleaned out in quite a while. It made me worry about the brewing machine...

Overall it's a good Starbucks, though.  I've been at least a dozen times and they've never made my drink incorrectly or made me wait for long.  It's always clean and you can't deny that it's nice to sit down for a coffee with a freshly-PURCHASED newspaper, magazine or book!",2010-06-07 02:39:30

Having been to both places--Gallo was super close to my house and I only started going to Otro once it closed--I can say the food is pretty much the same.

My coworker had some sort of Star Alliance voucher for the Maple Leaf Lounge that he wasn't going to use so he gave it to me.  I had never used the ML lounge before because it's not something I would normally do and my company wouldn't pay for the use of it so if I did want to use it it would always be on my dime.  I had to show my boarding pass in addition to giving them the voucher so I guess you need to actually be flying with them that day?

For the most part I fly only domestically and I usually take early flights so for somebody like me it doesn't really make sense to use these lounges on a regular basis if I had to pay for them each time.  I believe the admission is 25 to 50 dollars or so depending on your type of booking.

I heard somewhere if you are an American Express Platinum member that the use of the ML lounges I don't know how true that is but if you can use your AMEX to bypass lines at security check points that would totally be worth it as well if you travelled that often.

The lounge itself is a really nice place to relax.  There are comfortable chairs to use as well as a buffet of food and drink as well as a wide variety of magazines which you can read and bring with you when you leave.

I went in the morning before my flight so the fare was only breakfast type food and I don't know if the beer tap was working but I wasn't going drink beer that early.  Normally I can see how it would make sense to come after breakfast if you since you could basically drink all you want and eat non breakfast food too.  There are quiet spots that are less occupied and there are even showers to use if you felt inclined to partake.  

This lounge is a really nice thing to take advantage of and if you were somehow stuck in the airport for any reason this would definitely be a choice if you didn't want to leave the airport and get a hotel if you were only going to be delayed several hours versus an entire night.",2014-10-03 19:11:30

Good variety, two side dishes with your entree, and they even brought us samples of the sauces to taste before we ordered.

HOW DO YOU EXPECT CUSTOMERS TO WRITE A REVIEW EVEN BEFORE YOU EAT THEIR FOOD AND EXPERIENCE THEIR SERVICE? THEY OFFER 10% DISCOUNT IF YOU WRITE A REVIEW AND YOU HAVE TO SHOW THEM THE REVIEW YOU WROTE. THATS JUST SO SKETCHY. SO I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THE HIGH RATING OF THIS PARTICULAR RESTAURANT IS BECAUSE EVERYONE REVIEWED FOR THE 10% DISCOUNT.

I walked in the restaurant with the boyfriend and OH MY GOSH, I have never seen a waitress that look so rude and mean before in my life. She had hell of an attitude that just showed so clearly on her freaking face, the way she talked and handed our menu. YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOURE GOING TO GIVE A DIRTY LOOK LIKE YOU DID, CAN YOU NOT WORK? NO CUSTOMERS WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE AND DINE THERE WITH THE CRAPPY SERVICE YOU 'THINK' IS SERVICE.

So you think I am overreacting? Oh hells no. I have to admit I am very sensitive about customer service. My boyfriend? He likes to keep it to himself and he always tries to stop me if I want to complain to the waiter/waitress. He was the FIRST one to tell me about that waitress. He immediately felt like he wanted to leave but we already stopped by 2 restaurants before this one and we were just SOOOOO HUNGRY to go elsewhere.

Sushi was so thin. PERIOD. Fish to rice ratio was so bad. Too much rice and fish was so thin that it was so TRANSPARENT. We didnt order much on our first batch and there were only one or two other tables besides us and it took FOREVER to get our order. We specifically asked no sauce on any of our nigiri and they forgot and put sauce on it. I told that rude waitress about it and she went to go tell the sushi chef and she comes back asking very ruthlessly, 'are you not going to eat that?' I wanted to freaking get up and tell her off because of her arrogant attitude. UGHHHHH. Miso soup was salty as hell. I took a sip and put it to aside.

You can only order two rounds compared to three at other restaurants. I dont know why this restaurant is still in business and not only that, they definitely need to re-hire the servers and get rid of the rude and arrogant ones. Also, fish meat has to be much more thicker. The sushi chefs need to be more professional. They curse and talk too much when making sushi. They walked out of restaurant with the apron on and came back inside and didnt see then washing hands EVEN THOUGH they wear gloves to make sushi.

I wanted to go to Goyemon but their wait was way too long for two hungry stomachs. This restaurant was probably the worst one out of my Vegas trip this week. I didnt want to leave any tip for the waitress and I do not feel bad about not leaving tip because I have no reason to give her any. My boyfriend said to leave it for the other waitress that was slightly 'better' than the rude one.

I am korean and I do go to Korean owned susbi restaurants because AYCE sushi is mostly ran by Koreans BUT!!! This place is missing every component of a good restaurant.

You order up front when you walk in. It's ok to step to the side while you take it all in. Once you arrive at a decision look around and see if there's an open register. Someone will be smiling and that's the all clear. This is a lunch / late eve place.

You'll be given a number that you place on your table. Don't fret. No matter where you sit they'll find you. That includes the tables outside. Feel free to meander about, taking your time to grab silverware and drinks before selecting a table. (If you need to stop at the beautiful restrooms the servers will still find you.)

The menu is amazing. The concept is simple: Happy food makes happy people. Locally sourced, organic with plenty of vegetarian options. My gluten free friends will be happy: Tons of options! And (!) they will work with you to meet your dietary needs. That's how cool they are.

I've had the good fortune to eat with friends here and share. Yum, yum, yum! You simply must try the avocado hummus to start. When adding sides I love the sweet corn & quinoa.

Both times I've had a fairly pleasant experience but I love the service department here.

Everyone is friendly and happy to help. I know they take good care of my car and give her a complimentary wash too!
I even came too early as far as mileage but not time (10,000 miles or like 5 months recommend? - since it had been 5 months I decided to just take it in since it had been awhile since my last service) for an oil change and they told me to wait another 5,000 miles since I can go about 10,000 before each one. I feel like with other smaller places they would of happily changed my oil without thinking about it. They did recommend and rotate my tires though. They were also happy to help with two parts that I thought may or may not have eventually went out -they replaced it no problem with the car warranty. 

This place is great but I will I'm not a fan of the ""sharks"" as I call them out front waiting for people to come in to talk to them about buying a car. Standard car dealership tactics but it's a little intimidating for someone to walk up and there are about 5 dudes waiting to pounce. They don't bite though, not too hard I guess. 

I love the Toyota brand and if I do get another car I will definitely get it from here.",2015-08-23 03:15:34

When I walked into the place on a Saturday morning there was nobody in there and took me by surprise the pillow filled wall couch and the eurotrance music playing (not loudly but noticeable) and a single guy at the counter. And order of an Americano and a Chai Latte came to about $10 which I find a little expensive (since americano's are relatively cheap). The guy told us to have a seat and he would bring it too us. Interestingly the drinks came on a plank of wood with mineral water and a bite sized desert bit.

The coffee was good (nothing groundbreaking) and it seemed like a really trendy coffee place. I think this is a good place to check out, only make sure that you change your way of thinking in what a coffee shop should be.

I'm Asian, and feel as though I can say this: finally, a sushi joint that reminds me of the ones I've been to on the West Coast.  Loud, not too expensive, full of fun sushi, noodles, yakitori...and other Asian people.  That's a good sign. 

The sushi is FUN.  The menu is huge, and usually I'm weary of enormous menus, but you can see how high-volume the restaurant is, and you can tell the sushi is fresh and constantly made. You'll get lots of deep fried rolls, and cream cheese laden ones, yes, but along with it, you'll find vegetarian rolls with nice accents like mint, or strawberry. 

Keep in mind, the sushi bar serves faster than the kitchen, so we got our sushi first, then our appetizers. 

The yakitori and tempura menu is cheap, and was just OK.  I didn't mind because it was only $1. The tempura didn't have enough panko crumbs, it was too batter laden and thick, but still I thought it was yummy.  (Think, Asian inspired bar food!) The yakitori didn't really have much grill taste...I don't think it was prepared on a robata, which is fine, but I don't think I'll order it again. 

The house salad was typical, but the ginger carrot dressing they use here, my favorite!  Sweet and tangy, creamy and fresh. 

Dessert was 50/50. The fried banana with caramel sauce and ice cream was delicious.  The wrapper, thicker than usual preparations, but gave the dish a nice crunch. 

The cream puffs, I'm pretty sure were one frozen from a box.  (I might have bought them at Costco at one point!) 

But again, if the people weren't so nice, the ambiance so boisterous (sushi artists yelling our in Japanese, or whistling) I may have given Ru Sans fewer stars.  But the service was good, the environment fun and casual, the sushi is cheap and yummy.  

Can't wait to try the $10.10 lunch buffet!

However, I guess you could consider me an ice cream snob--I can go all year long without eating ice cream at home and never give it a second thought, and I really only get pumped about eating ice cream when I get it directly from a Ben and Jerry's or ice cream parlor. When we moved over to the west side, I realized that I would probably never visit Ben and Jerry's again. Fortunately, Tremont Scoops is close to my new digs, and when my wife scored a new job, we decided to celebrate with some ice cream.

This place automatically gets points because they don't close early. What's up with all the coffee shops around here closing around 7PM? Plenty of bleary-eyed students and young professionals who need their late-night caffeine fix live around here! I was honestly shocked when I learned that they were open until 9PM or so.

One of the biggest problems with getting ice cream in the store is that I have trouble picking a flavor...I absolutely love super sweet flavors like cotton candy and bubble gum, but I also like coconut flavors, and of course there's always mint chocolate chip. However, the aforementioned flavors don't mix well together--cotton candy and mint chocolate chip, yuck! Also, when I'm making one of my intermittent attempts to shed a few pounds, my wife and I will share a cone, which means that the choice is narrowed down even further to one flavor. As I predicted, I had this problem at Tremont Scoops! I couldn't decide between pumpkin, apple pie, pomegranate, and others I can't remember now. Fortunately, the blueberry granola yogurt was out of stock, which made the choice a bit easier! I settled on the pomegranate and my wife had pumpkin. Both of them were great!

Tremont Scoops sells ice cream by weight, not scoop, which is something that I've never encountered before. We got two decent-sized cones for like $4-5 total, which seems reasonable to me. They also sell a wide variety of vegan desserts too, which I would like to try in the future, because I had some vegan chocolate cake a few weeks ago from Poison Berry Bakery in Cleveland Heights and it was light years better than regular chocolate cake! Also, they have doggy ice cream, and I'm sure my dog will enjoy it when I treat him to it (once he stops having accidents in the house on a weekly basis, that is!)

The inside of the place has all sorts of cute paintings of cats and dogs too, and we enjoyed our cones there while locating all of the hidden items in the painting.

Honestly, I can't think of a bad word to say about Tremont Scoops...we had a great time and the ice cream was fantastic! I look forward to going there on a regular basis next summer when the weather's warmer!",2010-10-15 03:32:34

I just finished hosting a graduate student event at Hart House coordinated through the event services on site.

As this was for a student organization, the rates were more reasonable than about just about anywhere in the area. The service was great - Devon in the event office was flexible and supportive of me as I put together my first major event.

On the day of, the staff were helpful and the room was set-up on time :)
The food was great - although we ordered the most basic full-day meal offering, everything was tasty and well planned since it easily accommodated vegans and vegetarians without any hassle. As it is the middle of winter, the staff was also nice enough to keep a fire going in the fireplace throughout the day (not that we needed it for heat or anything).

My only complaint would be that there was significant hallway noise, not from students, but from the regular staff moving tables/chairs/maintenance equipment around since it was the middle of the day. Just be forewarned, and when it is recommended that you rent a microphone and speaker for use in the East Common Room (for a nominal cost), I recommend you take the advise.

One of my favorite things here is that the salespeople were not hounding us. They greeted us and let us know they were there to help, but they didn't follow us around. I think the salesperson may have mentioned that they are not commissioned. 

I finally found a table that I loved and the cost was very reasonable. Win! While the sale was being written up we also stumbled upon lamps that work perfectly in our family room that were also reasonably priced. Another win! Delivery was only around $100 which was well worth it to save the hassle of getting it home ourselves.

The delivery was one of the most impressive parts of the whole process. I was easily scheduled for a Saturday delivery. They called me the morning of as a reminder of my delivery window and texted a confirmation. The delivery guys called from the gate as well.

The hostesses were super friendly upon arrival and we were a lil late and they made us feel super welcome and let it know it was ok. The entrance was beautiful with the blue color tones. We shared everything and our waitress helped us decide and even helped with a virgin cocktail suggestion that was beautiful
and tasted wonderful !! We had the sesame prawns with foie gras, crispy duck salad w pomelo (please don't miss this one), crispy duck spring rolls, the Thai sea bass , pea shoots , and fried rice with salted fish which I loved! For dessert we shared the chocolate bomb, and the persimmon tart ( loved this one as well , as persimmon is rather hard to find on menus!! The General Manager even stopped by to say hello , and showed us the way out. They know what they are doing here!! There is more to dim sum , full entrees, and even a tasting menu, so the options of dining aren't just restricted to one way. There were many exotic higher priced items too, if you want to splurge!! They have a private dining room up above that was busy on the mezzanine and I'm sure the views up there are nice. It's nice because they have a nightclub as well next door if you want to do dinner and club , that is right next door, but we were having dinner too early to go. I like Hakkasan MUCH better than Tao ( sorry Tao) they are on it!!! 


UPDATE! Still great as ever! A nice bar and lounge as a pre-club spot for Hakkasan Nightclub while you wait for the doors to open. The lighting is beautiful and service excellent !!!",2018-02-05 01:43:59

From the outside, this place doesn't look special by any means. It has a chain restaurant in a strip mall look to it. The good news is that once you walk in the door, everything changes. The inside has a very classy look to it, the staff is very friendly, and the food is excellent.

I've been to Tutti a handful of times and here are my favorite items;

Appetizer- You can't go wrong with either the Mussels Marinara or the Sautéed Calamari, both are great.

Main course- The Homemade Gnocchi is amazing and something worth trying. Other winners are the Eggplant Parmigiana and Red Snapper.

Dessert- The Crème Brulee is excellent!

As with most good Italian restaurants, Tutti Santi has a very large and diverse wine list.

Very good food, friendly service, and an overall nice dining experience gives Tutti Santi and above average rating of four stars.",2011-10-12 15:40:50

It seemed like it had a good portion of nice reviews so I called and made reservations. Let me tell you I was very happy with my choice. From first contact when I called to book a table, the gentleman I spoke with was very friendly and professional (one of the italian gentlemen who work there). 
Upon arrival for our dinner reservation, she beat me there by a few minutes. By her account, either the owner or general manager was very friendly and welcomed her to the restaurant, and immediately had her take a seat and got her a water while she waited for me to arrive. As I walked in, she was talking with him, and very happy with her experience to that point. We were seated by another very friendly italian gentleman, and ordered the calamari appetizer, which we both agreed was probably the best calamari we had both had! The bread was great, fresh, warm, and flavorful. The bus boy was very polite, and tentative, topping off our waters often. The salads were great...simple, light, and tasty (I'm not a fan of having 20,000 toppings on my salad...greens and olive oil are good for me). I ordered a dish that had pieces of chicken stuffed with spinach, and flavorful veggies with a sauce. So good, I didn't leave a morsel on my plate! Nice portion as well, not so much food left I had to take it home. I had a bite of her ravioli, which was a cheesy goodness but not too cheesy. All in all, both meals were phenomenal, although a tad pricy...but I was kind of expecting that, being V-Day and all. Our waiter was great...something about being spoken to in italian by someone from the other side...just makes the experience better. The owner/general manager was all over the place helping his staff, redirecting waiters, chatting with his guests, it was a great sight. The restaurant was busy when we left, and the owner was happily greeting and ""ciao-ing"" every single person who left. Hell, the bathrooms were very clean, tidy, and smelled good, something you don't always see! This is the kind of thing I want when I go to an quality italian restaurant. We had an awesome time, and being big italian food fans, WILL be back again.",2012-02-16 04:46:02

I was in the mood to try a slice of their pizza but I got there late and the sliced pizza was old. Too bad since the crust still looked promising. 

The garlic rolls looked NOTHING like the ones Rod photographed. These were undercooked, in need of butter, garlic, cheese and anything else. 
1 star

The marinara wanna be that came with it had the color, consistency and taste of concentrated tomato paste nothing else- Catsup awful! Here is a hint, if nothing else marinara should be the color of tomatoes, not dark as beet juice. 
0 stars

Ravioli alla Mama - cheese Ravioli with Prosciutto, mushrooms & sun dried  tomatoes in pink sauce ($11) Ravioli soup is more like it, they were served in a bowl drowning in sauce. I couldn't find trace of prosciutto or mushrooms either but way too generous with slices of sun dried tomatoes (it's the only thing showing in the photo)  Know what ? no one wants mouthfuls of that stuff, it's meant to be used sparingly. Aside from that I poured a little black pepper and parmesan on top and it wasn't not all bad 
2 stars

The Apple Gorgonzola salad looks nothing like in Chad's picture either. The apple is shredded thin, loaded with iceberg lettuce, there's hardly any gorgonzola and has way too much dry chicken on top. But it still tastes pretty good so OK
3 stars

The Bruschetta is really good, I wouldn't expect any better from what is essentially a pizza joint.
4 stars (!)

The chilie relleno wrapped in the egg mixture was delicious, plenty of cheese and the chilie itself was cooked to tenderness perfection.

It is a very elegant restaurant inside a beautiful Victorian mansion. I was pleasantly surprised as I took a step inside...

My brother made a reservation during the week and we were given a table upstairs. With my grandpa a couple steps behind, I quickly noticed the number of stairs inside the restaurant. It is not really senior-friendly, especially with the washrooms located in the basement level (there was a strong odour there too). There is a dining area on the main floor but there was an oddly quiet wedding party going on.

The ambiance, full service and table setting truly made it a fine dining experience. The only problem I had was the children running around. I was surprised the parents let them and the manager never said a word to them.

My brother called in ahead of time and they prepared a set dinner for us. It included the following:

- Barbecue suckling pig with jellyfish (The skin was crispy and the meat was not too salty)
- Sautéed scallops and prawn with salted egg yolk in a crispy nest (All of us enjoyed the deep-fried prawn because the batter had salted egg yolk and we have never tried anything like it. It reminded us of moon cake with egg yolk! Yum...)
- Braised shark fin soup with fresh crab meat (Sorry but we did have shark fin soup. The shark fin pieces were surprisingly long and thick, and the soup was tasty, not fishy at all)
- Braised whole abalone with vegetable (I found the sauce to be a bit too salty but the abalone was nicely cooked)
- Deep-fried crispy squabs (These were very flavourful, moist and tender)
- Sautéed snow pea leaves with assorted mushrooms (Nothing special but we love mushrooms)
- Poached lobster with supreme stock (We usually don't order lobster but this was pretty tasty - it must have been the ""supreme"" stock ;) - and the lobster was cooked perfectly)
- Steamed green bass (We also love steamed fish, so as long as it is fresh and does not taste fishy, we'll take it!)
- Braised e-fu noodles (E-fu noodle is our favourite kind of noodles. It was a nice, light ending before desserts)

Especially for a milestone birthday, ordering Chinese birthday buns (壽包) is a must! The buns were not the prettiest but they were soft and the lotus paste filling was not too sweet. The egg yolk inside each bun really made it seem like we were eating mooncakes except it was bread.

Overall, it was a fairly grand experience. I loved the decor inside and out, the food was mostly good, and the service is decent. I did not pay the bill but I know it was pricey. But it's nice to splurge a little and enjoy an amazing meal for someone's milestone birthday!",2013-11-25 01:37:46

There really isn't so much of a secret to it - it's Suite 114, located on the 3rd floor.  At first when you enter the building you think there can't possibly be a bar in here...but there is.

Once you get to the bar and enter, you find yourself washed in low lighting, some interesting art on the walls and a bunch of ikea tables and a few couches in the middle.

Last night I met up with a couple of friends at Sam's. I had never been and although apparently it used to be quite the dive, they've done a good job of modernizing it. It's got a contemporary feel to it now (with black and silver being the primary colours of decor) and the staff is super friendly.

Plus, I was perusing their menu and their Sunday Brunch (Sundays from 10am-2pm - all you can eat for $14.99) has quite the assortment!

And speaking of assortment, their regular menu also has quite the variety. Everything from your standard bar snacks such as poutine, potato skins and calamari, to restaurant grub such as hummus, piadinas and lasagna. Plus for those of you who don't have to watch your waist line (I curse you), definitely try their deep fried cheesecake. It looked amazing (that's right - for me it's a 'look but don't touch' kinda thang).

My three star experience was well over two years ago when I went with a few friends for some beers and pizza during Sunday afternoon football.  Service was decent and the pizza was good enough for me to come back for some more.  The crust was thin, and the cheese to sauce ratio was on par, with good flavor.  We dined in the restaurant area, which was clean and comfortable.

My next experience was lackluster.  After work (3am), I stopped in to order take out.  The place had two other patrons at this time.  I was immediately greeted by the bartender and ordered a drink from him.  Remembering the last time I had their pizza, I decided to relive the experience.  So I ordered a pizza, half cheese, half pepperoni, to go.  My order was placed.  A few of the cook's friends stopped in to visit and were chatting for about a half hour.  The bartender said my pizza should be done in a few minutes.  Pretty long time to cook a pie, don't ya think?  Finally, my pie was boxed and in my arms, hallelujah!  I get home, my pizza is burnt to a crisp! Black!  I tried to scrape off the bottom of the pizza crust because I was so hungry.  Needless to say that didn't work to well, so after a slice and a half, my large pizza was thrown in the trash :(.  I chalked that experience up to a misfortune and realized that if I ever try to order pizza there again, check it before walking out.  No big deal.

Last night, I was in the mood for Italian take out.  I was craving penne ala vodka and mozzarella sticks.  Let's just say the mozzarella sticks were the best things my husband and I ordered.  I got my penne ala vodka and he got the baked ziti with garlic bread on the side.  My penne pasta was cooked well but the sauce was pink like it should be but...weird.  There were chunks of tomato, onion, and ham in the sauce, which is fine, but the sauce was not flattering whatsoever.  The vodka was definitely not cooked enough, leaving a bad vodka taste.  The viscosity of the sauce was also very thin.  I highly do NOT recommend this dish.  The baked ziti, was just that, with lots of gooey mozzarella cheese and ricotta.  There were loads of diced tomatoes and onion in there as well.  We didn't mind the veggies in the ziti but they were raw when they were thrown in the dish, when they should've been sauteed or carmelized.  The garlic bread that was served with our dishes, was less than to be desired.  You could tell it had at once actually been a good roll that was sliced into quarters with butter and garlic, but the toasting of it made it taste like charcoal.  Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.  They were your average bar cheese sticks with marinara.

It had all the typical comfort food in Japan like tonkatsu (deep fried pork cutlet) and oyakodon (chicken, egg & onion rice bowl).  It's a cafeteria/ fast food style place which may not be too appealing to some people.  We decided to come for lunch today since I had a craving for Japanese style Hamburger rice.  It might sound strange to have hamburger with rice but believe me it's so much better than with a bun.  If you like this dish and you are ever in Hawaii, you must try loco moco (hamburger with fried egg with gravy on rice).

We came for brunch on a Saturday and were seated right away indoors because there was no more space outside. The menu is plain and simple; they offer several omelettes, crepes, and French toast to choose from. We ordered the Spanikopita French toast (Baby Spinach, Feta, Asiago, Fresh Mozzarella, Balsamic Glaze), mocha French toast, and Swiss omelette. The Spanikopita French toast is the first savory French toast I've ever had and it was pretty good. The mocha French toast and Swiss omelette were unimpressive thoigh. The former was just bread soaked in chocolate with whipped cream on the side and the latter was just your typical omelette (a little dry though). Would recommend this place if you're looking for a casual brunch spot and I can imagine the brick-walled cafe being very cozy in the wintertime.

I don't think I have ever been able to shop at the Bay and not had issues trying to check out: no one staffing any of the 4 available checkouts, long lines as the till is being operated by an 80 year old woman, then price checks because no one can understand the sale signage.

If you are not shopping in the cosmetic department, it is always a headache. This Bay is clean and does have lots of great stock in housewares and clothing, but I can't motivate myself to go through the ordeal every time.

My last Bay checkout experience was with my sister as she was waiting in line to by Bodium coffee press, there was one couple ahead of her and they were just buying a spatula. Should be simple. In, out, no complications. Of course the spatula rang up differently than the couple was expecting. So the old lady at the till called a price check, someone sauntered over to the till 5 mins later to see the item, then wandered off again for a good 10 mins.
All the while the sales associate operating the till did not offer to ring my sister up while we waited for the spatula twins to find out the correct price. So everyone just stood around in annoyed silence until the price checker lumbered back saying that no, spatulas were not part of the housewares sale.

The couple then decided not to buy the spatula. No apology was offered to my sister for having to wait that entire time.

Unlike Toronto where everything seems to open forever, it was slim pickings in the area.  After eventually setting on Chinese food, because ""China Town"" was nearby, we started our walk over to see what was available.
The only place that was opened was Silver Dragon.  I know some reviews rave about Dim Sum (and some don't) and I didn't see a lot of dinner reviews, but hey, can't be too bad right?
The place was a trip down memory lane when Chinese restaurants were decorated for wedding banquets.  Tacky and worn out - reminds me of a Seinfeld episode with a clued out Host and a mostly Caucasian clientele.
The place was sparsely populated since it was a bit late.  
The wait staff kept coming over and asking if we wanted the seafood specials.  I've been in that situation before.  The seafood menu does not have pricing and some times, the prices are made up on the spot - basically what can we charge these people today?  Decided not to get into that game at this place.
We ordered just a couple of dishes, rice and my older son wanted the hot and sour soup.
The soup was basically the last drips off the ladle and water down to make a small bowl - my son was so hungry he just didn't care.  We were worried that the rest of the order was going to be whatever they scraped together.
The beef dish was surprisingly good but the chicken was bland.

It is a discomforting and uneasy thought.

If a clerical person mis-enters a string of numbers in a computer terminal somewhere...it can alter the trajectory of your life...in both good and less good ways (""the bank just made a mistake in your favor...you have $7 million extra dollars""...yay!...you tried to withdraw that $7 million...""you're under arrest for Grand Larceny"").

It's like a game of hopscotch designed to break your leg.

It's the reason people react with uncontrollable, explosive diarrhea when they hear the phrase ""I'm from the government and I'm here to help you"".

It's the reason people go ""postal"" and climb a tower with an AK-47 and one bottle of water (they won't be thirsty for long)...and it's the reason so many people view the ""government"" as a noxious weed, growing stronger by the minute, feeding on the flayed carcasses of its citizens.

No, not me...but I know people who feel that way.

Although I do have good excuses to feel that way, for any one of several reasons...the latest being my time in the 11th circle of hell known as ""dealing with the MVD"".

The MVD made a small error on a string of numbers (either a person or ""machine""...I use quotes for ""machine"" because clearly the MVD's computers were manufactured by Charles Babbage, circa 1866...their brass cogs, cams and gears long since ground down to an unusable state).

The result of this was a mis-match between my registration information and my insurance information...easily resolved...both numbers are memorialized in many places, in many ways...years of insurance records...years of registration data for my car...the stamped VIN plate riveted to my car...the letter and printout's sent by my insurer, to the MVD, verifying coverage...a million and one pieces of proof!

It was easy to see that this was not my error...not an error by the insurance company...but an error somewhere deep within the bowels (and I use that word advisedly) of the MVD.

Surely, they would rectify their error, once it was brought to their attention...

Not so fast...Selma and Patty at the MVD say that their data is inviolate and no amount of proof by me or my insurance carrier could change that outlook...the letters were sneered at ""the VIN on the letter doesn't match our records""...""the registration doesn't match the insurance verification""...""the registration doesn't match our records"".

After more than 15 phone calls (total time on hold of almost 10 hours), 7 letters, 3 visits to the MVD, and more hassle than anyone should have to bear...I was told earlier this week that all was in order...I could return to the MVD and get my tags.

I showed up...took a number...waited my turn...sat down at window 19...and was told ""tough luck""...no go on the renewal.

Did I scream?...Did I threaten?...Did I bazooka barf all over the counter?...yes, in my head.

And I probably looked like I was about to go ""postal"".

But I didn't...I kept my cool...me and Obama...cool guys...to the bitter end.

In person, I once again calmly explained what had happened and showed my MVD ""service adviser"" my proof (including my letters, prior registrations...the whole wad that I had brought along...just in case).

I may have discovered one of the few helpful people at the MVD...certainly one of the few with an IQ above room temperature and one of the few not completely imbued with the ""we are the MVD...we don't make mistakes"" attitude...he called a supervisor of some sort over...they typed for a while in the computer and viola`...I had a tag!

Oh, before I forget...they charged me a late fee...for their mistake.",2010-04-16 21:22:47

It was obvious neither had reservations as each paused to read the menu posted outside. I walked over to the Maitre d' and politely asked why these groups were being seated while we were told we had to wait.  The maitre d' claimed I was told we would be seated at the next available table, but the placard on our table stated 8:45PM (i.e. 30 minutes from the time we arrived).  Under normal circumstances I would have left, but I was too hungry and the other dining options were less appealing.  We ordered the crab Rangoon appetizer for $6.99.  There was just an itty bitty smear of cream cheese in each (4) Rangoon and I would guess the closest any of them came to a crab was when the chef waved a crab claw over each.

The parking lot is really cramped and gets packed since there's a floor hockey thing that shares the same lot and building.  Once you walk into the foyer, you'll notice a crazy stench like a nuclear bomb of sweat.  But no worries, just dash for the dodgeball court that is to the right after you enter the doors.

The line up to register and pay took longer than I expected but I guess it wasn't a big deal.  If you can, try to change before going to this place because there are no change room and if you try to change in the washroom, it is a little filthy.  

But after all that, the fun begins.  The shoes are a little wet since it is sprayed with anti-bacterial cleanser; this is a good thing if you don't mind your feet feeling a little soggy.  After you put on these super cool blue jumping shoes, staff waste 0 amount of your time and you just get on the trampoline and jump jump.  There are some no brainer house rules so make sure you follow them!

If you're lucky, you get do some pick up dodgeball which they have a designated trampoline for.  You play with random mix and match group so you never feel left out or anything if you're foreveralone.

The price was reasonable.  We opt for 60min of tramp time for $14 which includes tax and shoe rental.  They can easily charge more for tramp time and shoe rental seperately if they wanted to.

I'd recommend this place for anyone that wants to try something new.  Don't worry about a jumping with a billion kids, it's a place for all size and ages.  Besides, you'll feel like a kid again once you get on the trampoline.

Cheers!",2012-03-12 13:15:28

Fantastic place to reunite with amazing food. The service is good. Our waitress was announcing the specials and notifying there is one crumble left. I jumped to it; and said I would have that. We also ordered Mimosa(mix of orange and grapefruit juice). Delicious!!! My other two friends got the French toast and pesto/cheese omelette. When our food arrived, I was awed by the beautiful presentation. I was also impressed with their choice of fruits. Usually, for any breakfast place, the usual fruits are cantaloupe, grapes, strawberries, banana...but at Le Pasée Composé, the choice of fruits are exotic, like figs, dragon fruit, and blueberries, with toppings of lavender flowers. I had three glass of 1)warm peach with vanilla yogurt 2) crumbles and 3)berry smoothie, and on the side toast, spread of Ricotta cheese, sprinkled with chia seeds and lavender flower. Just by writing the description; I can taste the food again. One word: Succulent. My friends loved their dishes immensely.

The space itself is cozy and the service was great. However the tasting menu had a few dishes that we did not enjoy. 

One dish in particular was terrible - smoked mackerel with kale.  Too much bitterness and fishiness in one dish. I must give credit to the service staff though - the kitchen was nice enough to give us an extra course without us saying a word (they could tell we didn't enjoy it). 

I appreciated the thought that went into the tuna starter but the flavours didn't quite work together - beets, apples, bitter greens  and tuna didn't mix well.  The sausage and sweetbreads were ok but nothing special, same with the bouillon. The goose, our last dish, was good but a little too late and not enough to make up for the rest. 

The dessert was really nice - the ice cream and cake were great but nothing spectacular.

V. and I walked over here after a cool happy hour elsewhere, and this time I brought my beautiful cousin with us.

Edge Walk is one of the things you should try when you come to Toronto.  I've lived in Toronto for over six years and I still considered the CN Tower's Edge Walk as an item on my bucket list.  You won't regret it!

Walking around the edge of the CN Tower's restaurant roof and hanging yourself 1,168ft above the ground or 116 building storeys!  Any idea how I felt?  My heart was beating very fast even before the journey began!  I waited to do it for a long time, and finally my husband and I decided to do it on our wedding anniversary.  Many people had the same idea!  There was a couple in our group that came for their honey moon!  So sweetie pie!  

My both hands were cold and wet.  Ya! I was very scared in the beginning.  It took a while to get used to the height.  Talking was very helpful.  Our guide was nice and friendly.  He eventually made me feel more comfortable and I didn't want the walk to end.  It was so much fun!  I wish the walk could be extended up to an hour so we could have more time to enjoy ourselves hanging out on the Tower with the fascinating scenery of Toronto!

Their staff were knowledgeable and funny.  It was a part that made this journey memorable.  If you want to experience one great thing in your life time like CN Tower's Edge Walk, GO for it!  Very short moment can be remembered all of your life.  

Keep in mind that you should check the weather ahead of time before you book the walk.  Wear comfortable clothes and tight shoes.  Make sure that your shoes are not gonna fall off and land on people on the ground :D.  Keep your jewelry at home and tie your hair if you have long hair.  Then you can start your journey without worrying about your stuff and safety.  There are 6 people in a group, excluding the guide.  Everyone get s attached to an overhead safety rail thru a trolley and harness system.  It felt very annoying to me when I walked, especially the harness line behind my head!  By the way, I realized that it was the only thing that can keep me from falling! haha..

A ticket for the walk is $195.00.  It included 1 individual photo and 1 group photo, a DVD of the walk, and access to  the LookOut Glass Floor, SkyPod and attractions.  If you'd like to have all of the pictures that were taken, it's an additional $25 for a USB. Then, you can enjoy the moment again and again! 

PS. It was an exciting experience but not thrilling as zip lining over the Canyon or Rafting on the White Water River.  If you're a sky diver, I'm sure that is more stunning. Anyway, it was worth every penny and I would recommend it!",2015-08-26 05:43:51

I ordered the hamburger and side soup (cream of celery root). I was then asked if it was okay that they cook the burger medium here, and that it would be slightly pink. Which got me excited, and I said ""No that's great"". So I then had a lot of hope for the burger. If I was there again, I wouldn't order the burger. I'm trying to eat better these days, so when I eat a burger I need to make it count. It needs to be a good one.

It took a while to get our food, even though there were maybe only six tables with people, including us. Which is fine, but then you would hope there would be a lot of care put into the food... alas, there was not when it came to the burger. The burger was not pink in the middle as advertised. It was a good thickness, which I liked, but in that case it would be even harder to overcook it and dry it out. Besides the paddy, as individual elements there were good things going on. The tomato relish was nice on its own, but when slathered on the burger, it made it seem more meat loafy than a burger. The bun was good on it's own, but coupled with the well done burger, and lack of condiments left for a fairly dry experience. There was really nothing that brought the whole thing together, or what Guy Fieri would say... the kicker as well. The burger cried out for more condiments but there was none... There was cheese on the burger, but it was undetectable except in appearance. A good burger should either be a tasty well cooked paddy, or a burger with top notch condiments that just drool down on to your plate. This burger was neither.

To end on a good note. The cream of celery root soup was lovely. It was velvety and frothy and had nice depth to it as you kept eating. It is good to see they are capable of making good food with nice flavours, just maybe not made to order? I also had from the beet salad, and that was yummy as well. I think they can totally do soup and salad well, but I worry about their mains.

I tossed and turned about what rating to give Hey. 2/3s of the food I tasted was yummy, so I went in with a cautious three stars (60%). And I hope for better things in the future.",2013-03-09 15:23:14

But, you want to know what makes it better than Subway? Their meat isn't prepackaged and salty and full of chemicals. 

At Chipotle, while you're ordering, you can see the cooks actually grilling the meat! If that doesn't make you want to chose Chipotle over Taco Bell....I don't know what to tell you. 

Chipotle is my go-to place when I want a quick bite. I think about the days where I'm going to be rushing and plan my Chipotle visits - thats how much I love this place.


I order the same thing every time: a burrito bowl with brown rice, half black and half pinto beans, peppers & onions, half chicken/half steak, mild salsa, corn salsa, sour cream, cheese and lettuce. When I'm not feeling ""naughty,"" I only request a little bit of rice and I cut out the steak, sour cream and cheese. 

I also cannot resist ordering chips and salsa. Their chips are delicious because they're salted with a slight lime flavor. Best chips in town. [I'm not sure that I'm qualified to make that assertion because I don't really eat a ton of Mexican food or have much experience with other chips ;)]

Sometimes, I also get a Corona (or two...) with my meal. They serve alcohol here! SCORE!

kM-DMZZOjn3ZDlDQiZpY0A,jkVaPj3MIS69-OcfX0c_CQ,yUuM4BtUviSv1ZMahYwqnA,1,1,1,0,"I was really hoping that I would not need to write a review for a gym (I'm more of a foodie...) but even after several weeks, this is an experience I will not forget. 
Before delving into my recount, I'll start off by saying several things I am happy about the place - clean, large, many lockers, pool (although can be weird as it is by the entrance/foyer), a lot of equipment, a lot of space. The sled area is a bit small though.
And onto the story...
During the school year, I go to the York Mills location (wonderful staff by the way despite being small in size). On weekends and breaks, when I am back in Vaughan/Richmond Hill, I go to this location and/or other ones in the area. Recently, I purchased a number of personal trainer sessions and after speaking to several friends as well as other members, I was told that I did not need to purchase that many sessions. Therefore, I wanted to see if that was true and since I was unable to go to the York Mills location, I decided to ask the staff at this location.

My review is based on two visits. On my first visit, I went with my friend who just happened to lose her pass. She gave her information and was then provided with a new keychain immediately. My only concern with this is how photo ID was not necessary. Secondly, I asked the front desk staff about whether there was a minimum number of personal trainer sessions I was required to purchase. With an uninterested and unenthusiastic face, he responded with ""no I don't know."" I found this to be strange as this should be of basic knowledge to any employee, although they are not a personal trainer. Being a full time student and employed, it is difficult for me to have an appointment before 9 pm. Also, for the reason that this is a 24 hour gym, it should have knowledgeable personal trainers or managers nearby to accommodate guests. 

On my second visit, I came earlier. It was swarmed with fresh faces, eager to sign up for a membership....and I wish I could of warned them about how arrogant and pushy these employees were going to be... Coming from a retail background myself, I do understand the need for managers and employees to be persuasive however, my experience with the fellow staff members came to a point where I don't believe I will ever have a genuine smile coming into the facility anymore. I asked the same question to the front desk, which had approximately  2-4 people. I openly asked if there was a minimum number of sessions or if there was a personal trainer nearby that I could talk to. He quickly said ""yes I can book a session for you to see someone who has more information than me on that."" To begin, my simple question was not answered and rather, he was moving the accountability onto someone else - a marketing tactic. I continued saying that I actually have sessions at the York Mills gym and he responded with ""oh so you're jumping to different locations and seeing what you can get?"" This was accusatory and completely unnecessary. As stated before, I have an all-gym membership because I am always moving and not always in Toronto. From there, I said that I did not want that many sessions and that I don't need that many anymore. As soon as I mentioned the word ""need"" another person interrupted the conversation and continued to persuade me that ""everyone has a different minimum."" What I find to be most problematic about this interaction was how the root of my question was not being answered and they were not trying to help my NEEDS. I do not blame this person for popping into the conversation as her coworker didn't seem to truly understand my dilemma however, I did feel attacked. Remember, it is not what you say, but HOW you say it. 

To add on, another one of my friends told me about her GoodLife experience and how she felt there was a lack of transparency and genuine concern for the consumer. To be specific, she said that she would think about the personal trainer sessions but the staff said ""just join today!"" She replied by saying that she had to think about the financial cost. The staff said that if you're determined then the cost ""should not matter at all."" 

This is probably the longest review I have ever written because this experience affected me on a much deeper level. Moreover, based on what I've heard from my close friends and acquaintances, this seems to be a problem with how the staff are trained to do and to say. It should be understood that this is a long term investment, not just a $30 sweater. There needs to be more compassion and less arrogance, dominance, and apathy. This should be a welcoming and non-judgmental environment.

TLDR: pushy and inconsiderate employees",2017-01-07 03:58:07

Quality at this place has dropped recently the last 2 visits. I'll do another revisit in a couple of weeks to make sure its not a fluke.

@ Uni - It doesn't have the same sweet creamy texture as previous visits. One of the Uni was not scooped out properly, so can still see what looks like the vein of the sea urchin on it.

@ Toro - This was a little disappointing. The fish didn't really taste all that fresh.

Other items that also seem to have dropped in quality is the shrimp tempura, gyoza, eel, yellow tail, albacore, and red snapper. 

This place does have fast service, but a little disappointing they do enforce their 1 hr time limit now. One of the cool things about this place was you had fast service and they would let you keep ordering way past the 1 hour.

Either Sushimon has let quality control slip a little or they've cut some corners recently. This looks to be a trend since Danica L. did report Sushi Tachi, owned by Sushimon has quality slipping as well. If its quality control, its understandable. If its the latter, its unacceptable with so many AYCE sushi places around. Still Sushimon has one of the fastest service and the most variety. I'll be keeping an eye on this place.",2010-06-01 15:04:05

Earlier in the summer we finally decided to try it so we ordered take-out from the lunch special menu.

I decided to go with Pad Thai (with chicken) since they note on their website that it was voted ""The Top 10 Best Pad Thai in Toronto"" by blogTO.  I asked for them to prepare the Pad Thai super spicy and my husband's green curry (with chicken) just regular.  The lunch specials come with soup, salad and a spring roll and the total was like $20.

The verdict:  hot and sour soup tasted like it was prepared in bulk; the spring roll was tiny and nothing to write home about; the salad was a few leaves of torn up head lettuce; Pad Thai was, unfortunately, a huge disappointment but the green curry was the star of the show.

I suspect that, in error, they made my husband's green curry super spicy and my Pad Thai super bland.  For the Pad Thai, the integrity of the rice noodles was lost because it was overcooked, they used chicken breast and sliced it nice and thin but there was no seasoning - I had to add a lot of salt.  It really needed sauce, cilantro, some lime, etc.  It tasted like it wasn't made-to-order but rather prepared in masses for the lunch special - a lot like food court style.  Anyway, again with the green curry, it was absolutely delicious; I've never tasted anything quite like that.  I usually don't order green curry because I find a lot of restaurants make it kind of sweet but this was so well balanced with different elements of flavour in every bite. Also, the rice was cooked to perfection.

I've also had the massaman chicken lunch special which, instead of the potatoes being in the dish, was served on mashed potatoes which I did not care for.  Curry was very, very bland even though I asked for it spicy.

I stumbled across Bad Attitude Boutique after searching for ""pinup"" attire and after reading a few reviews I knew I had to come in. 

My boyfriend and I showed up around 7pm and there were a few girls being laced up as we walked in. We spent a few minutes walking around the store looking at all of the fun novelty and sexy costumes, and also a huge variety of ""play"" corsets (not true steel boned).  There is everything from sequence pasties, sexy lingerie, men's costumes, wigs, tutus, and more! My eyes were in heaven. 

  Let me next say that this is not just simply a costume shop, this shop produces hand made, custom corsets.

   The lovely ""Tutu"" was assisting me (shop owner) and I told her I was there for an under bust steel boned waist training corset (this means business). Hidden BEHIND the counter are hundreds of hand made steel boned corsets! Can a girl say HEAVEN?! She measured me and then laced me up in one (and was kind enough to get my boyfriends attention to teach him how to properly lace me) and I was immediately in love! Cotton lined, COMFORTABLE corset. 

I honestly would have purchased it on the spot, but Tutu isn't out for your money. She wants you in the best corset possible! She allowed me to try on one of her own corsets to see my waist in a smaller size (I wear a 24, and she laced me in a 22). She also told me that she wanted me to see my waist in a style that she was currently out of, but emphasized that it would hug my natural curves and fit me better than the first corset. 

So tonight I left without a corset, but I also left more excited than ever thanks to this amazing shop. Tutu lives, breathes, and speaks corsets. She had every answer to all of my questions and even reassured me that after my purchase we would stay in touch incase any concern came up.

-Kv9DMBZGQyf2WSKDR7LwA,rCWrxuRC8_pfagpchtHp6A,ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg,4,20,10,17,"Kay had been wanting to hit Paris 66 since her birthday passed, so I belatedly took her there last weekend. Before I pile deserved praises onto the food, I will mention a few problems I had that add up to one deducted star. 

1) The tables are too small.
2) The seating is cramped. I can dig communal dining, but this was uncomfortable. The folks on either side of us were literally bumping into me as were the servers. 
3) For such an upmarket restaurant, I found it slightly tacky that instead of having a soda fountain, Paris 66 brings diners plastic bottles of whatever soft drink they request. My Sprite container looked terribly out of place on the table, so much so that it almost made me wish I had requested water instead.
4) We were unfortunately seated next to a party of very rude, intrusive, old, monied women who kept interrupting our ""intimate"" meal to complain about the restaurant. These big-haired, red-lipsticked, leopard-printed hags, who could have come straight from central casting (file under 'in-laws' or 'rich, elderly country club snobs'), were offended that we were served before them despite the fact that we arrived before they did and literally and openly felt that they mattered more than us. After all, they were ""regulars"" and their husbands were ""important."" One of them stared at me during our entire meal while occasionally whispering to her companion and pointing her long. bony finger at me. When I smiled at her, she scowled. Did she know who I was and dislike me for my politics? After all, I did get a very real Scaife family vibe from the ladies, but I digress...

Nevertheless, Paris 66's food, while not inexpensive, was flawless to my palate.
Going all-out, we ordered two appetizers: Beef Carpaccio and Fried Artichokes. The shaved meat of the carpaccio was tiled ornately onto the cold plate and was  garnished with a basic vinaigrette-dressed salad that clarified the taste buds with its snap. Carpaccio is a bit tricky to consume considering how everything adheres to the eating surface, but the fresh, uncooked proteins made the work worthwhile. I'd always wanted to try this ever since I saw it made on the TV program ""Great Chefs,"" but the piece never showed how a diner is supposed to approach it. Let's just say my butterknife proved useful. The artichokes were facile, breaded, hot fat joy. The large, brawny, fleshy artichokes were steamed sublimely beneath what was a crunchy, almost sweet coating. A serving of greens topped with a creamy dressing embellished the plate and proved refreshing.

Bewildered as to what my entree would be, I instantly jumped on one of the specials of the night in Seafood Bouillabaisse as did Kay. I know, we ordered the same dish! That doesn't happen often.

The bowl was deceptively deep and comprised a very ample serving of an  ambrosial stew that hid a menagerie of marine creatures. Shrimp, swordfish, mussels, clams, crab, baby scallops, and Neptune knows what else all bobbed up and down in the murky, yellow brew. Every single morsel (my favorite being the fall-apart nuggets of swordfish) was perfection in terms of taste as well as texture and was everything seafood should be. Once I came to the sorrowful realization that the pieces of meat were no more, I eagerly downed the empty broth like a thirsty viking and used the bread to sop up the remainder.  

Again, feeling frisky, we went with 3 desserts, each one triumphant in its own way. An artful strawberry tart was first, a marscarpone cake was second, and a hazelnut cake made for the finale. I relished the hazelnut the most as the moist cake obscured large hazelnuts that were akin to cereal box-prizes. The mascarpone cake was angelic and lighter than helium in every way, its subtle sweetness rewarding slow...easy consumption. The strawberry tart was blessed with an Art Deco spirit that almost prevented us from eating it for fear of destroying its design, but once we broke it down, we found that its beauty was more than skin deep. Speaking of skin, a sugary fruit ""roll-up"" was its hide and held a milky, buttery filling underneath that itself held a vibrant, ripened strawberry. 

Ryan, our waiter, indicated that he was in the prime of his career by providing keen service and displaying Olympian-level social acrobatics and patience even with customers who were less than friendly or polite (I'm talking about the party on the OTHER side of us who didn't thank Ryan for a single thing and ignored him even as he was trying to serve them their dinners. I suppose the phrase 'Money doesn't buy you class' applies.). As we left, he gushingly approached us and asked us which dessert we liked best. I felt as if this young man's heart's desire is to make customers happy, and we did indeed leave happy despite our encounters with the wealthy and uncouth. 

P.S. Kay will have to tell you about the macaroons. She took home a dozen or so. Yup. Having a girlfriend is costly, but...she's worth it.",2012-05-11 05:34:29

On a whim, a colleague loved this place so introduced this restaurant to us so we came here and tried several dishes. The place felt lively, yet relaxing. I particularly liked my virgin ultimate pineapple drink -  essentially piña colada and strawberry ice in a freshly cut pineapple without the alcohol. It's so refreshing & satisfying! The Jamaican chicken was just okay and the portion was plentiful.  the waiter was friendly and everyone seemed to enjoy the atmosphere and conversations.

Another reason to dine here is that it's pretty close to the strip, has plenty of parking and easy to hail a cab or get rideshare to and fro.

We had the kale/quinoa salad, deviled eggs and chips and guacamole. Kale salad was pretty good size.  My friend brought up a good point- you want to share this or at least take the rest to eat later.  It's a lot of roughage for one person. Good and light dressing. The flavors went well - kale, quinoa, sunflower seeds, red bell pepper, lemon rind zest, Parmesan cheese, and grapes.  Refreshing. 
Eggs were yummy but is anything not when you put bacon on it?  Good heaping amount of mixture. Not thee best I've ever had but pretty darn tasty.  
Chips and guacamole are house made.  Nothing mind blowing but still good.  Salsa had a kick and roasted flavor so that is good.  Not weak.  

Overall, pretty good for airport food considering I dont think highly of airport food. This did not let me down. I heard they make handmade tortillas so I gotta try their other location.",2013-06-08 23:51:57

First, EVERY TIME we go in the manager is sitting in a booth hamming it up with his friends who come in to chat. He leaves untrained employees to do the ordering and when customers begin to get frustrated only then will he come up to help out. He seems to rush people through the ordering process too, which is annoying and bad customer service. 

Burgers: original is the best one, but still dripping in grease. If you don't like spilling (yes, spilling - not dripping or dribbling - spilling) grease all over you, DONT get the mushroom and Swiss burger. Fries are hit and miss - you might get some good ones but most likely not. 

Tables - dirty. Every single one. We had to wait 10 minutes and SIT DOWN at a dirty table before I went to the counter to ask that someone clean one for us. Even then it took them another 10 minutes, and the individual grumbled about it, in front of us, while he was wiping mess all over the floor rather than actually cleaning.

The staff delivering food asked if we would like sauce. We said yes - ranch and smash sauce, please. He left. And didn't return. For 35 minutes. When we left, he said ""Oh! did you still want your sauce??"" Ummm.... No. I don't want the sauce I asked for over 30 minutes ago. And no apology, either.

The inside is modern and clean, but I only entered to pick up food I had ordered earlier.  Our second experience was takeout, which was fast and food was still hot.  I am a fan of the Chicken + Walnut--it's in a lighter brown sauce with water chestnuts, broccoli, peppers and the honey glazed walnuts make it.  My husband got the Beef with Scalliions--which is exactly what it sounds, but was actually delicious and fresh.  We had General Tso's (which they made with all white meat for me) and Chicken Lo-Mein--which were both great. The GT sauce was more tangy than sweet, which is not my preference, but it was still delicious.  There's so much of the menu I still need to attempt, so keep those recommendations coming! I highly recommend this place if you live nearby or are in the area.  Great price, awesome food.

Update: We've explored the menu more.  
1) Clay pot chicken:  the eggplant was cooked well and the garlic sauce was fine, definitely not spicy.  
2) Mandarin chicken: Meh. Lots and lots and lots of Spanish onion.  Must love onion. 
3) Milky coconut puffs.  Will not get again.  Square chunks of almond custard--which was flavorless and a grainy mushy texture in a moderately fried shell.  The sauce was honey which was thickened with sugar and was disgustingly sweet and not spreadable.  It made the fried dough soft.  There were a few peanut shards sprinkled on it.

The chips and salsa were really good with the salsa having a bit of a bite to it. Then the main attraction arrived. Holy cow! I've never had tortillas like this! They were fresh off the grill and had this wonderful buttery smell. After filling mine with chicken and all the toppings, I was in fajita heaven! These were the best I've ever had. My bf raved about the shrimp as well. We proceeded to eat way more than we should have but when something is that good, its hard not to. The guacamole side I ordered was good but I have had better so I might skip the $3 upcharge for it next time, but there will most definitely be a next time. SOON.

Throughout our meal, Anthony provided outstanding service in my book. Kept my diet coke full throughout and just filled it up, rather than asking, interrupting conversation as some waiters do.

This location is opened really late. I often end up here well after 1am following a concert at the Toronto Opera House across the street. After a night of music & drinks, pizza hit's the spot nicely.... and it's quick (and cheap).

The main negative here is the selection. Not sure if it's because I tend to be here late in the evening but sometimes they only have 3 maybe 4 Pizza's available by the slice. Compared to other locations, there should be at least 10 choices available. One time they had no Pizza available with any type of meat! Great for veggie lovers but after a night of drinking.... I need some damn meat on my Pizza.

Service is generally quick and efficient. Lot's of seating, I always find a table even when it's busy. 

I'm not looking for gourmet food at 2am but a little more variety would be nice. I will certainly be back after my next concert but hoping for some Meat Lovers pizza next time.

All were very good, everyone really liked what the got. The Bento Box is huge and could be split if you also got an appetizer or soup! 

The chicken teriyaki was really large as well, if you could double the chicken, you could split this as well. I think we will do that next time by ordering something small with it. 

Pork cutlet was also a very large portion with two hand sized flattened cutlets and several sides. It was on a platter, not a plate it was so big.

2 Buttermilk Biscuits
Ham, Egg, and Cheese Stuffed French Toast with Strawberry Jam and hash browns
Candied Walnut Buttermilk Pancakes (seasonal special)

With household chores needing attention it was largely a matter of location combined with a buy-one-get-one coupon that led me to Summerlin's relatively new Eggworks on Saturday, and having visited sister restaurant ""Egg & I"" nearly a year ago I'm happy to say that its fifth spin-off replicates the formula well, a very competent breakfast served amidst friendly confines fit for any age.  Obviously not the sort of place looking to reinvent the wheel, but rather a locals-only kind of spot where nearly all the patrons present during my early morning meal were 'regulars,' it was with nothing but smiles that I was greeted at the hostess podium at 6:45 and offered a seat at the kitchen-side bar or a table I opted for the later, a small two-top amidst spacious confines already loaded with condiments, menus, and utensils as College Gameday played on televisions all around.  Never shy to over-order, even as my waitress informed me that two entrees was ""a lot,"" it was mere moments after seating that I made my selections and starting with two doughy, $3.49 biscuits finding slight salvation in butter plus honey I quickly realized I should have again ordered the signature banana bread, though things would soon improve, my BOGO coupon yielding a duo of plates nearly overwhelming my small table.  Beginning first with another item dubbed 'signature,' the stuffed French Toast is offered with an option for bacon, sausage, or ham and doing my best to recreate the Monte Cristo the results were admirable - the fluffy eggs loaded with cheddar and chopped pork beneath slices of vanilla scented, golden bread ready to be gilded with syrup or jam.  Moving next to an item from the seasonal menu, a $9.75 three-stack of pancakes was next in line and topping the fluffy discs with pure-maple syrup brought from home plus a few pats of butter I'll be honest when I say these could just be the best buttermilk flapjacks in town, each bite surprisingly light with ample buttermilk tones punctuated by pockets of melting brown sugar and rich caramel with toasty walnuts through and through.

Far larger and brighter than the original Egg & I location with similar smiling service and a 6am opening every day of the week Egg Works Summerlin is a great addition to the neighborhood and with coupons frequently offered in the local mailers serves as a great place for families to enjoy a good breakfast without breaking the bank or succumbing to big chains like Denny's or IHOP.  Certainly not a 'destination,' but a great spot for a leisurely morning while reading the paper, watching gameday, or just sitting on the dog-friendly patio I only wish they advertised specials more prominently, the only indication of those lovely pancakes found on a laminated menu left at the table.",2014-10-20 13:23:49

I also tried my dad's steak with chimichuri sauce... it was ok, but nothing special and I would not order that.

Since I came here on a Monday they didn't have Chicken and Waffles on the menu.  *Sad face*  So for Plan B I settled for my other favorite, their Croque Madame ($19.00).

Lisa (who owns and runs the place with her husband and veteran Dave) introduced herself to us and thanked us for coming.  We could tell they had their regulars, like the people who showered Lisa with hugs on their way out.  It's great to see places like this, places with ties to the neighborhood.  There's an appreciation for the personal business and the business gives that love back to the community.  I'd only just met Lisa but I was happy for their success.

Caveat here- I feel like a lot of the reviews I've read about this place are comparing the classic Avenue Bar to this new Food Fight iteration- I don't have a dog in that fight as I never really cared for the Avenue Bar food that much. But I will say that the decor and atmosphere here are great.  Very comfortable (we were seated in a cushy booth) and really relaxed, calm, and quiet.  

We ordered the tempura calamari as an appetizer, which I totally recommend- it was the best thing we ate.  Lightly flash fried in sweet chili sauce, with a side of Napa cabbage, topped with peanuts and cilantro- this was perfectly balanced and tasty.  Unfortunately our entrees were .... well, I have to say that the closest thing I could compare them to is cafeteria food.  I ordered the steak.  A 12-ounce strip for $30.  The menu said it came with red wine sauce, maître d'hôtel butter, and duchess potatoes loaded with sharp cheddar cheese, bacon, chives, and sour cream.  I asked for no sour cream.  I got a steak with the maître d'hôtel butter as described, but it was also smothered in a thick, tomato based sauce.  Almost like a marinara.  and there was a lot of it.  It made the steak, which was already swimming in melted butter, pretty unappealing. Just a really weird flavor.  And the potatoes were basically mashed potatoes pressed into a ramekin and baked. No cheese- no bacon- no chives. Again- weird. My boyfriend's burger was supposed to come on a ""house-made cornmeal kaiser roll."" It came on a standard hamburger bun.  And for $11, it was a burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, and soft cheese spread (which lent the burger a strange gritty texture).  He only ate half of it due to the excessive char on the burger.  His fries were unremarkable and undercooked.  There are plenty of spots in Madison where a better burger and fries could be had for 7-10 bucks. Step it up, Avenue. 

We liked our server and she bought me a birthday dessert partially due to the food issue- both the desserts were yummy (chocolate layer cake with berry sauce and creme brulee) but we noticed that all of the service staff looked pretty unprofessional- jeans/tshirts/etc etc which was an awkward standout in the classy space.

1U3iyKyZBO7DPU1jn3x_kw,s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,ypfFfR3-PbtoslIhohNstw,4,7,5,6,"This review is for the UYE just held here in the opening month of 2013, graciously hosted by Jen S.

After not having partaken in Korean BBQ since about 2006, this was a really fun event for me.  And my 3.2 lb. temporary weight gain the next day showed that the AYCE eating was pretty intense, too.  Fortunately, I dropped over 5 lbs. since then.

While Nelson Q.'s and Jen. S's table boasted some heavy eaters like Nelson Q. himself, Paolo D., and Jieun L., and finished off 5 rounds of food, my table that consisted of myself, Tony T., Bobby Y., Misti Y., Anthony M., and Ife A. were no slouches either.  In fact, although we may not have packed in as much total meat as our friendly neighbors just to the south, we polished off 9 rounds of food.  Yes, I was counting!  Never underestimate the eating prowess of Misti Y. and Bobby Y., who can be formidable eaters if it suits their fancy.  And Tony T., our masterful grill chef, who taught me that Jalapeno Peppers taste even better when cooked, just kept eating and eating amidst his cooking tasks.  Anthony M. ate his fair share, and took very few, if any, photos.  And, poor Ife A. kept getting blasted by dense smoke from the grill, which seemed intent on striking only her.

Most food served was very tasty.  But the quality of the marinated Kalbi we were served in different rounds was inconsistent.  One batch was melt in your mouth delicious, but another was noticeably tough.  And at our table, service was mixed.  At first we could barely get our server's attention.  And, I had to ask for water 3 times and then after hearing ""Okay!"" wait another 10 minutes, and watch 2 new diners be brought water glasses by our very server before any water refill was delivered to deal with the Spicy Boneless Sliced Pork before me.  One of my dining companions remarked, ""Maybe she said, 'Nokay!""  After this, we became more assertive in asking for replenishment of finished off items, and soon enough all was fine and we were eventually bombarded with water bottles and even a pitcher of aqua.  

We were not as adventurous as the hungry Hawaiian and his cohorts, so did not order any Beef Intestines.  But we enjoyed waves of Beef Short Ribs (Kalbi), Rib Eye Beef, Spicy Boneless Sliced Pork, Beef Brisket, Beef Tongue, Baby Octopus, and Pork Belly, as well as fluffy Steamed White Rice kept hot in tiny shiny silver pots, Kimchi, Bean Sprouts, White Onion, Jalapenos, and Steamed Egg that was like a great souffle.  I also very much liked a bowl of hot Bean Paste Soup, and had to acknowledge that a Baby Octopus actually tasted good, and so did Beef Tongue.  To the restaurant staff's credit, grills were changed periodically to avoid the meat sticking to them, and our server and other crew members never complained about our prodigious ordering and eating.  With a stiff monetary penalty if we left half a pound of food behind hanging over our heads, we did consume all we ordered during our 2 hour and 20 minute dinner.

5 stars for the companionship, witty conversation, and fun at this UYE; and kudos to host Jen S. for arranging this fine event; to the restaurant staff for serving us; and to Tony T. for deftly utilizing his professional cooking skills on our group's behalf.

4 stars for the food and service.

So many people crammed into the store with so few employees doesn't meld well. Additionally, getting help in this place is near impossible. I've come here a few times just to pick up a phone. Needless to say, 15-20 minutes go by before anything gets done. Lastly, the employees act as though there is no rush nor are they concerned about their manners. Several rude employees will give you the impression that it isn't an ""one time thing.""

Ceviche, steak and chicken dishes were fabulous and complimented the Modelo Dark, Inca colas and two lonely piscos. Or maybe it's the other way around, maybe the drinks complimented...oh whatever.
And I can't forget the canchas.
Peruvian corn nut like snacks, less crunchy and with a whole lot more flavor.
Great with pre-dinner drinks.

Three flat screens hanging in the bar, all tuned to some kind of Peruvian TV were also very entertaining. Nothing like watching kickboxing during dinner, a loop of Machu Picchu on state run tv, and a latin soap opera. 

Also, once more I got to practice my Spanish on the highly attentive and very friendly server, who was extremely patient with my Spanish tongue.

Dinner for six was $120 before tip. 
The piscos are 12 bucks each, but you'll only need one for a great buzz.

I was given a huge portion of three fluffy pancakes, a large portion of eggs & three pieces of bacon. The bacon was actually a little disappointing- it tasted as if they bought the cheapest kind, or maybe it was just a bad batch? Everything else was delicious. I saved one of the pancakes for breakfast the next day & it was just as good. The egg whites were perfect and were super filling. My boyfriend loved his french toast, home fries and sausage.

Who built this modern looking restaurant with wide open doors on this lovely sunny Phoenix day? How long has it been here beautifying the area that is in need of new things? Fast forward an hour and I had my answer. 3 months they've been serving really good food in a relaxed sports related environment. Much better food than your normal sports bar. I saw bison burgers on the menu. Desserts that look incredible. My waitress read my mind and mentioned their soup special. I am a soup guy! Cheese and broccoli? Yes please! Potato cakes are also cheesy with a hint of pablano pepper. Tried the homemade coleslaw and it's about the best I ever had! I tend to judge a restaurant on its gravy or it's coleslaw. I judge Wild Game Grill 5 stars! Prices seem good too. There's a lot of food I have not tried yet so I'll be back very soon!,2015-01-10 07:13:47

Parking was across the street and free, so what a great way to begin the trip.  

Walked-up to the ticket window to purchase 2 lawn tickets that were very reasonably priced ($8).   Bag check was easy and fast and the staff was super nice. Surprise Stadium is home to the Royals and Rangers and on this day the Royals were hosting the A's.

My son and I walked around the stadium and were very impressed with how clean the stadium was.  Not to mention the views were amazing and  it was a joy to see how close you are to the action.  The bullpens were readily accessible, so you could watch the pitchers warm-up.  There didn't appear to be a bad seat in the stadium.  It was around 80 degrees with some clouds, so it never got too hot.  In addition, there's a decent amount of shade behind home plate if you need to avoid the heat.  

My son and I got a bit ""hangry"" after 5 innings, so we walked around to see what food options were available.  My son opted for the Diamond BBQ and I went to the Chucky's Famous Pork Tenderloin trailer.  My son's BBQ Pulled Pork was smaller than expected and he said it tasted just OK.  My breaded pork tenderloin was tender, moist and really good.  We also enjoyed the waffle fries that came with my meal.  Service was good and condiments were available if you wanted to add ketchup or BBQ sauce.

Tonight, we tried one of the Ethiopian wines, a sweet red called Axumit. It was nice -- I think they might even sell bottles of it to take home,although I'm not positive.
I love all the vegetarian dishes here, especially the Shiro Wat, which is ground peas with berbere and onion. Also, I always try to order their home-made crumbly white cheese to add to the dishes -- they're often out of it, because it takes a long time to make, but it's delicious if you can get some.
The tiramisu and the coffee is also very good, as well as the Koranti, which is hot tea with some ouzo in it.

Overall, this place is just fabulous. I've had Ethiopian food in places like San Francisco and D.C., and Lalibela's has come out on top every time. The crowd is pretty nice, too. Lots of people from varied backgrounds frequent the restaurant, as well as what I think of as the NPR crowd -- you know, the ones with glasses and funky jewelry who have loud, obscure conversations about astrophysics or medieval Bosnian literature or the deplorable state of the world's organic strawberry farms... that could be because Cafe Lalibela is a sponsor on KJZZ, though, which actually was the reason I sought it out when I first moved to Phoenix.

After reading the reviews I was looking forward to a great meal at Bean Curd, but honestly it was even better than we could have expected. First off, the dining room is very nice, cloth table linens and napkins, nice lighting and clean. Our server was fantastic, very polite and helpful, checked on us an appropriate amount of times and this was all on his first day! We were first served a bowl of wonton chips to satisfy us before the food came. There was a plum sauce on the side and what I believe to be a wasabi mustard of some sort.  I am a sushi lover so I went with the OMG roll to start. It came wrapped in foil and was on fire as it arrived to the table. What a great presentation, but it wasn't all for show because the fire gave the roll itself a nice smoky flavor and also helped to caramelize the teriyaki sauce that was on the roll and as well as crisp up the rice on the base of the roll. It was sooo good, they did not skimp on the shrimp or crab and I loved it. Definitely will be ordering this roll in the future. $10 Well spent. For our main meal we went with the orange beef, amazing chicken, pork lo mein and fried rice. Honestly I have to say every entree was some of the best Chinese food we have ever eaten. You can tell these dishes were made to order, individually seasoned large portions. You are also able to customize the heat on any of the dishes that are labeled as spicy which is nice. This goes back to the dishes being made to order. The orange beef was crisp on the outside and tender in the middle with the orange glaze that just coated the strips perfectly. We customized it to be less spicy and loved it. The amazing chicken was just that, amazing. It reminded me of a combination between an orange chicken and a sweet and sour chicken. Large piece and chicken breast very lightly breaded and covered in sauce. The lo mein and fried rice were also flavorful and cooked prefectly. Overall we were expecting a good meal, but left with our bellies full, plenty of leftovers and knew we would return at a later date. 10% military discount.",2018-01-27 23:48:44

Like celebrity hotpot and other hotpot places, you can make your own dipping sauce. I always make mine with sesame sauce paste (look like peanut butter), soy sauce, a bit of garlic, a bit of vinerga, and chili oil. 

Some may not like the prune juice (they also have soy milk and water with lemon), but I think it goes well with the food. It won't make you feel full quick and feel heavy like soy milk. 

They didn't charge us for leftover but friendly remind us to not do it next time, which was very nice of them.

Since I only gave it 3 stars, you can probably guess that these buffets are not my thing. It's always another person's plan, such as a family birthday, which brings me to these.

The good: Um, it beats the Mandarin in about every way. They have less standard 'Chinese food' dishes than the Mandarin (where's the lemon chicken?), but their edge is preparing various fresh dishes or meats. As their name suggests, you can have a make-your-own wok, fresh grilled steak, salmon, oysters and a couple other things. Also, they have quite a bit of sushi being constantly prepared and served fresh. It's actually pretty good and miles ahead of what the Mandarin puts out. Lots of ice cream choices and pretty big dessert bar.

The average and below average: First, the service. One thing I'll give the Mandarin is good service. Today, they lost our reservation, even though we made it clear as possible the day beforehand (even spelling the name letter by letter). Your table is visited less frequently and you often have old plates and napkins on your table for sometime. The food itself is generally average, with perhaps a couple things reaching a '4'. There isn't a single bite that gives you any 'wow' factor. It's basically your gluttonous impulses exciting you with so many food options, but upon reflection, little really stands out. That said, they don't put out much poor food either to their credit. Soft drinks and water bottles are included which adds a bit of value too.

I like the ambiance over the Mandarin. Nice decor, and warmer more relaxing colours. One possible downside is that it's completely open, so you may get more noise than some other places. It's also funny that the bathroom area moves to a Greco-Roman tile art motif, which has little to do with the attempted Asian feel of the rest of the place. I doubt anyone else cares however.

So if 'Chinese' buffets are your thing, give these guys a try. If a group suggests going to the Mandarin, try and persuade them to come here at least.",2015-06-15 01:50:09

This location is pretty average for Red Lobster. Not a stand out. But, also well above some of the lesser of their locations around the valley. Friendly staff. Clean enough.

There is a not-so-secret ""secret menu"" for the endless shrimp. Look it up online. Sadly, it seems that the locations aren't all that keen on offering up these little insider treats. More often than not, valley-wide, during this current run of endless shrimp, the offerings have been slim leaving some of the best tasting options as ""sold out.""

Their ""four course"" weekday offering is also a reasonable deal. I don't know why they serve salad and soup together rather than one first, followed by the other. But, this is not fine dining so they are forgiven. Decent clam chowder always lacking in clams.

This place is trendy. I've seen countless Instagram pictures of their beautiful restaurant so I knew I was bound to visit at some point. 

First tip: Reserve a table!
The place is packed ! I went on a rainy Friday night but it was still full. We initially got seated at the bar while we waited for a table and it's so cramped there. We got changed to the high tables near the door which was better but not the best seats in the house. 

We ordered the kale mac and cheese, Buddha burger, Poutine, and the onion rings.  The food is AMAZING. The mac and cheese was especially remarquable. I'm a tough judge when it comes to mac and cheese but this one is one of my favourites. I can't even describe how good it was. 
The onion rings were really crispy which is my favourite kind. 
The Poutine was perfectly seasoned and warm. Super delectable. 

I can't comment on the burger because I only got a small bite but Adam said he got ""food sweats and that only happens when I eat good food"". If adam gets food sweats over vegan food, you know it's worth it. It makes him temporarily forget he's eating something meat free. 

The service is good. Given the demand it's ok if they forget certain things (water,napkins). I think they are very friendly though. They welcome you with a smile and serve you he best they can and don't seem overworked or unhappy.

Man, I remember coming here when it first opened and their menu was most likely last-minute without spell check edited by an 80 yr old china man straight off the boat. I'd always get a good laugh at that. NO worries though, the menu has been edited with almost no or little errors now.

But on to the show stopper, the head knocker or the drool starter..? FOOD. DIM SUM. The works. These guys set the standard for asian dim sum. Seriously, everything has their own distinct flavour that is just delicious. The BBQ pork has some pinenuts which is different and tastes amazing. Flaky, flavourful, and piping hot. Also the clam congee is SO good. The congee absorbs the flavour of the clams and vegetable ingredients and just makes it taste so fresh and gives it a natural sweet flavour. Amazing. Also, their pan-fried sticky rice has SO much ingredients it's crazy. Each bite will leave you a variety of either sausage, mushroom, green onion, etc. These guys do not cheap out. ALMOST FORGOT, order the mango dessert if they have it, (Menu sometimes changes) it's so fuckin' good. Chewy texture with fresh mango taste.

I know seems expensive and alot of food for one person, but I figured that all I could need eat I would take home.  The food was ok, I love the sides and ate all of them before I left.
My only concern is that I was not offered all you can eat.  Can someone please tell me if this place really does have it and if it is on the menu?  Please respond so it might help people in the future.  I do feel a little ripped off if they do offer it, but did not offer it to me.

This small shop offer a small selection of HK desserts, but from the two items I tried, what they lack in variety they make up with quality. I tried the mango sago for free as a part of opening promotions. The smooth mango base is very refreshing, especially with the bits of grapefruit mixed in. The little sago balls add that fun element and a different texture. It was super fresh and just the right amount of sweetness. 

My friend and I also tried the mango pancake which is a smooth thin crepe wrapped around fresh mango and whipped cream. The crepe is as smooth as a baby's bottom and super soft. I think I was more amazed at how they got the crepe to be that perfect more than anything else. Only complaint is that it's a little overpriced at $10.

The service was very fast, which is great for a take out place. There were no seating at the shop but plenty of tables and chairs in the main food court area down the hall. 

TL;DR: Desserts here are fresh and delicious, just a little pricey imo.",2018-08-27 00:35:11

It's always high on a lot my friend's lists of dive bars along with Frankie's Tiki Room, the Double Down, etc, but those recommendations are typically more for drinks and overall ambiance than food. This is why I was particularly skeptical about this one, even with a few friends swearing by it. Needless to say, I ate it and was more than surprised.

The pub is located on the east side of Tropicana in an iffy area of town, but you're not coming here for the class. The interior is decked out with British-inspired street signs, posters of boats and the like, with the waitresses wearing skimpy kilt outfits. There's also an outdoor patio which I've heard is dog friendly. I was fully expecting an overly loud, smoky bar scene that would have made eating a bit unsavory, but it was surprisingly quiet on the Saturday night we were there. The menu features all sorts of traditional British dishes that I've heard are hard to find at other locations around town. This is all good, but I only really care about burgers for the sake of this review so I'll have to try some of that other wacky stuff on my next visit.

The British Burger on their menu comes with a  1/2 pound patty, bacon, lettuce and tomato and choice of a few cheeses. My burger had great char flavor upon first bite, which carried all the way through. It was cooked a bit more than medium-rare but I was ok with it due to the overall great flavor. It was greasy for the first half, dried up a bit in the second half but was still ok because of the flavor. My bacon wasn't quite as cooked as I would have liked, but it still had decent flavor. The thin onions were good but I still pulled them off as to not overpower the great flavor I was experiencing. The lettuce and tomato were fresh, although the tomato was a little sparse, and the swiss cheese was melted and good as well. The bun was soft, gooey and delicious, and was very well proportioned to meat. Overall this was an excellent burger that I wasn't expecting at all.

While I typically don't care for them, my steak fries were actually really good; they were cooked well for the most part but there were a few soggy ones in there.  My side pickle slices were good too; they never made it onto my burger but I still ate them. At $9.25 with fries this is very reasonably priced; combine that with a beer or three and you're in for a good time. If you're looking for a unique local pub with plenty of drink and food options definitely stop by the Crown & Anchor.",2012-10-19 17:18:48

We walked in and the place was not busy at all.  3 people sitting at the bar, 1 table outside was taken and 2 tables inside were taken.

The hostess asked if we had reservations, I replied no.
She proceeded to point to only 2 tables and said we could have one of those .  Right across from the tables were 3 empty booths.  I asked if we could have a booth.  She said no that they were reserved.  I said 'really, they are reserved?'  She replied, 'yes, in a half hour.'.   Now I have made multiple reservations in my life to many restaurants across the country and ones that are way more upscale then this.  Not once are you ever given the chance to reserve a specific table or booth, and here she is telling me 3 booths are booked.  Ok, I wasn't going to argue.  We took one of the tables she offered.  

The food was decent.  I had cavateli, but for $19 was not worth it.  My son had short ribs and that was the best out of all the meals.  My husband got the burger and he did not like it at all.  I tried it and it was not good.  Had a very odd flavor to it.  He ate it anyway w/o further complaint.  My daughter just got the meatballs which again were fine but nothing great.  Same for the calamari app.

The reason for the 2 stars? Well after we were there for about 2 hours, only 1 of those 3 booths were  ever sat.  So because we weren't worthy of a booth and the hostess lied, we would never come back.  Paying that kind of money for food and you are treated like that is not going to fly in my book. It was never busy, only 2 couples came the entire time we were there and actually a 4th booth opened up after a couple that was there left.  So you keep saving those booths for worthier people I guess, we won't be occupying them ever.

The cucumber/carrot/onion/salsa bar was definitely on the sketchy side. 

But I love me some dirty, sketchy holes in the wall. 

I ordered the carnitas burrito, and I really liked it. The pork was flavorful, and abundant. The guacamole is standard guac (nothing to complain about or write home to mom about), but it adds good flavor.  The pico de gallo was in one spot in he middle of the burrito.

While the sides were pretty large the steak and lobster were quite puny. I ordered an American Wagyu rib cap that the waitress recommended  it was MP (market price) which was $80 for the steak and the half lobster was $25. The lobster was like getting a large prawn about 3 bites, quite a baby lobster for $25. I didn't not like the potato gratin that the waitress recommended it was a bit too rich in taste for me. 

Only thing that was great was that you got three different kinds of shoe string fries that 
were fried in duck fat with 3 different dipping sauces. This was complementary with order of a steak. 

The steak was good but the size and quality for $80 was not worth it for an 8oz steak.

My total bill came to be $180 for one (this includes tip of 20% and tax)  I sat at the bar because I was in shorts and tshirt and flip flops. The service was more like a 15% but I felt generous and gave 20%. I don't know if it was because I was at the bar but for a $150 meal I felt service should be impeccable. I shouldn't have to ask for a receipt for my bill or be asked to be refilled on my ice teas. 
For god sakes it's a high end steak restaurant.

1. American Wagyu rib cap $80 (market price) 
2. Potato algratin $14
3. Ice tea $4.00
5. Banana fosters egg roll $14 
6. Half baby lobster tail $25

Not worth $180, maybe for someone who has ton of money and don't care but not for someone who works hard for their money. 
Only reason I ate there was because mandalay bay casino gave me $200 in resort credit so I figure on last day having $140 left I go out with a bang. i might try again but I think I'll stick with an angus ribeye which  I believe 16oz and only $65.

It was her birthday and she was eager to use a $25 Dollar Gift Certificate. We love Sushi and we hadn't tried ""Hon Machi Sushi"". The server was very nice and was very helpful which made it easy for us to overlook the ""extremely"" sticky table that had to be wiped down twice. We are not that type of people and I was very reluctant to ask, however, it was so bad that i looked around to see if there was a camera crew ready to jump out and laugh at us. My hand literally made a noise as I ""pealed' it from the table. 

With that said, I again, was pleased with the servers attempts to help. On with the evening... They displayed several types of Cold Saki and the one I DID want, which is a personal favorite, was really a Sample bottle for Display only. Ok, I can dig that... time to order... Sushimi and Rolls all came out at the same time... we never were served the appetizers we ordered so I very nicely cancelled them... along with the plate of shrimp tempura and rice plate that my wife ordered and never received... 

Ok, now, skip to the bill. We rendered the $25 gift certificate at the time of the order... basically, we had to order $45 worth to get the $25 off. We were then informed that the alcohol does not apply... ok... I can understand that , but in looking at the bill to order the ""5"" dollars in food to put us up... we discovered that they were charging us for the things they didn't serve us ??? The appetizers and the main dish that never arrived... Ok, now my ""keystone cops"" radar is alerting me... we reluctantly order about 15$ worth of food and wait for it to go... we get the bill and it's not correct and we lost the will to fight it... we were double charged for the main dish..!!!! we paid twice ...for something we never received. 

By the way, food quality was ""ok"". Service aside, I would not return for the Sushi... there are some fantastic Sushi Restraints within a stones throw that are much much better. Voting with my Checkbook, no thanks in the future...

I assume this has been done because it is now under new management, so far I am very disappointed with the change over, the first thing they decide to do is sky rocket the prices, that's bad taste if you ask me, it might just push away all the regulars..

When the rest of the party got here 10 minutes later they still hadn't finished setting the table so as we were sitting down we had a server setting drinks right over our heads. When I ordered Dr.Pepper it took at least 10 minutes for it to come out ,but the worst of all was that it was super watered down. When all the drinks finally came out my mom's champagne had no bubbles! Our server was very nice but she didn't come by often and she asked for the wine list so she could see what was on it. They also had a really small place and bathroom. The color scheme or design wasn't pretty. When she came to get the check she took it but then came back to ask where our card was. She asked did you put it on the top and we kindly told her it was in the card slot. She didn't think to look there which wouldn't look good on the restaurant. Some of the really good things were the food. All the food was amazing. The music was nice and the owner would stop by and ask us how our day was and just other conversation topics.

This is my favourite place I've ever been for dumplings. They are significantly different than dumplings I've tried anywhere else.

We had the beef coriander, the pork with leek and shrimp and the lamb with green onions. All three were really delicious. Two of us were able to finish the three orders but we were pretty full when they were gone.

The short version: overpriced, terribly RUDE service, and bland food will definitely keep me away from this restaurant. 

We visited this place to celebrate having family in town. What better place to celebrate family than in an Italian restaurant, am I right? Well, today I was sadly mistaken. 

The place was half empty despite being a busy Saturday in the Venetian. We were seating immediately after our arrival and an older waiter came to our table to drop off the menus as well olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Not the friendliest of greetings, but I let it slide. 

While we were waiting to decide on our meal, I asked our waiter for some bread (thought it was odd we got the oil and vinegar, but no bread) to which he abruptly replied ""bread comes to the table after you place your order"". What's this all about? Was he afraid we were going to dine on free bread and water?!? Anyways, we then placed he order and things got really awkward. 

After waiting for our food for a few minutes, the waiter came to our table, literally dropped my girlfriends plate in front of her from about an inch above the table top, and set my plate as well as my brothers. He left without a word. 

Upon a closer look of my dish, something seemed off with the ingredients, but before asking I thought I would try it. This dish was bland, tasted of canned sauce and was not what I had ordered. Before I could even say anything, the waiter rushed to my table, took the fork from my hand and then pulled my dish of the table... without saying a single word. 

That was it for me. I raised my voice and asked him what was going on only to hear him utter the words ""the chef made a mistake, I'm fixing it"". While I appreciate him trying to fix it, his gross demeanor and terrible attitude interrupted the mood in the table, and upset everyone. To add insult to injury, the manager came over and tried to brush the incident off by justifying the waiters behavior and telling me not to worry about it. Not worry about it? Why would I be worried? I didn't do anything wrong!!!!

The worst part of all? The manager was within feet of our table the whole time, and he apparently knows this waiter is terrible.

And yet it did nothing to distract from the absolutely stunning meal and service that Robuchon provides.  I've now been to four of Joel's establishments - Atlanta (now closed), NYC (now closed), L'atelier in Hong Kong (now expanded).  I'm not sure why some open and other close, but it's certainly not because the food is poor in quality.

This particular meal was the Menu A with 2 appetizers, 2 mains and a dessert.  The Amuse Bouche was a Beet Gazpacho - the cheese that served as the contrast to the sweet beet added a fullness to the already complex beet that gave the gustatory tension that one expects from this class of cuisine.  

I had the bacon bread and a croissant as opening breads, served from an old-world bread cart brimming with fresh, warm goodness.

The appetizers I tried were the caviar on crab and truffle/lobster ravioli.  Both were excellent, though I was a bit overwhelmed with the fullness of the bed of crab meat.  The truffle lobster ravioli was a good example of the near-fusion that Joel's dishes often have - flavours very reminiscent of asian dumplings in my book, which is not a disparaging remark in the least.

For the mains, I had the black cod which was moist and very welcome to the palate followed by truffled spaghetti.  Gloriously decadent, resplendent with razor thin wafers of tartufo nero (truffe noir), it was satisfying to the point of overwhelming.  

Topped off with a glass of sabayon and berries, the meal was spectacular.  One can argue with the exact emphasis in any given dish, but there is unmistakable attention to detail and intentionality to every morsel.

Sumptuous violet couches, flowers with silvered glasses and grays yields a suitable backdrop to the dining and meticulous service.

Parking: I don't understand people's dislike of the parking situation at this venue. It was quite easy for us to pull in and find parking. There are multiple lots both on the east, and the west. When leaving the lot, we were able to pull out quickly. They have multiple lanes for you to exit, the only issue I had was trying to get back on the 10. The lights near the venue are terrible.

Security: Now this venue has tight security measures as far as bags are concerned. READ THE RULES, DON'T ASSUME YOU CAN BRING IN A PURSE JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE A LADY. I was turned around for a small bag, and my friends purse was taken. You MUST HAVE A CLEAR BAG. If you have any questions, make sure to read the rules. They also have it posted EVERYWHERE as you drive in, so no excuses.

Food and Drink: Now, this is where it will kill your wallet. I don't drink so it wasn't bad for me, but a simple non-ultra-premium drink is 16 bucks. That's a 1oz pour mind you. The fact they think Jack Daniels is ultra-premium is a complete joke. Don't drink here, it will destroy your wallet. Of course, they don't care, people will drink no matter the price. The food is no better, for chicken strips, fries, and a drink it will cost you $20 bucks. If you can, eat food before you enter. Now you can bring up to a gallon of SEALED water per person, which is nice. 

Overall: We have been to this venue multiple times, and I have sat on the seats, and been in the grass. I love the venue, it's loud, they have video screens, and lawn chair rentals. The chairs are great quality and are really nice. I recommend it to those who don't have a seat in the grass!",2018-07-23 16:23:44

Yesterday I decided to take them up on their suggestion. As lovely an experience as it is at one of the tables, sitting at the countertop by the open kitchen makes for a different view of Home, and I like it!

Watching the kitchen staff preparing food for later, heck, even watching them make my own meal-right down to the garnish, was fun to see. Although, I'm thankful for the sneeze guard between us ;). Tip: If you watch them cut potatoes long enough, they might just start talking to you! 

Is it possible to admire your sandwich? I think yes. This time round, I ordered the Home Reuben. Thinly shaved slices of meat with homemade sauerkraut, and melted Swiss cheese between two toasted slices of bread. That was a worthy sandwich. The cup butternut squash soup was a nice addition. My meal at Home wasn't complete without a glass of their riesling and some apple cranberry crisp with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce on top. The riesling is just a smidgen shy on the sweetness scale of being a dessert wine, but that's just the way i like it.

Somehow, I've lucked out with having Ryan as my server each time I've been in. He's attentive, and knows his stuff (my first time in he recommended the bison tartar... it's still right up there!). 

I only wish my wallet could afford to eat here more often. That being said, my mouth and tummy thank me after each visit. And I do like the fact that I can order some of the wines as a 2 oz serving if I'm wanting to try them out, or just have a bit to sip with my food.

I wanted to like this place, really, as I generally like to patronize the mom and pop shops and the dives. However, I just can't get into this for breakfast.  It was vacant when we were there, unusually vacant per the waitresses.  The waitresses were friendly, almost to much so, I think the waitress we had would have gladly pulled up a seat and incesently talked the whole time we were there. Not that I don't appreciate friendliness but I also wanted to just enjoy the company of who I was with. Decor is a throw back to the 70's, with bright oranges and yellows. Definetely a locals older crowd. Like Cheers - everyone knew their names of the few of other people that were sitting at the lunch counter. 

I had the the Pioneer Breakfast, the big ticket item on the menu ($8.95), but I wanted eggs and pancakes and this fulfilled both of my requirements. I thought I was ordering too much food and wouldn't be able to finish but in reality the portion size was that I could finish it. Granted I gave my bacon away. Bacon was crispy, not microwaved like IHOP does. Pancakes were decent, but I didn't like that they only provided you with Log Cabin syrup - I guess I shouldn't expect maple syrup. They did accomodate me when I asked for scrambled eggs with cheese on them (my way of trying to incorporate a omelet into my breakfast as well). 

So it was okay, but I wouldn't go back. Previously I had the chicken fried steak, I was underwhelmed with the quality- chewy and tough. Although, to their credit, the waitress I had then (who was great, and I think I have read other Yelp reviews on her) tried to warn me of the inconsistency in the product depending on who was cooking, which was ironically the owner on that day, and I went against her sound advice as I was determined to have it.  That time my friend at the pork cutlet with gravy and she loved it, I tried a bight and it was very tender, I should have picked the pork. 

It is inexpensive, but I would rather pay a few extra dollars and try somewhere else next time.",2013-06-05 16:50:00

I wonder how many miles a day they travel going back and forth helping people??

Update 2/14/17:  I came in here today looking for a specific item. After walking around a short time a clerk asked me if she could help me and I told her what I was looking for. She led me straight to the product and I ended up buying two of them because I knew once they were gone they wouldn't get more in. I had seen some reasonably priced floor rugs for $13.47 each at another Home Depot and the clerk happen to mention to me they had had it in a plum color also but it was sold out. It sounded like there was just one and it took forever to sell so it was just my bad luck it was gone. He said I might be able to find it at another store and suggested calling it ahead. I didn't bother to call ahead but just stopped in here while running errands. This location had two of the plum colored rugs so I bought both of them for my mobile home to replace some old rugs I wanted to get rid of. 

I must say, the clerk was not only helpful but EXTREMELY helpful and even took a photo of me standing next to my purchases so I could post it on Facebook because I was happy to find rugs in my favorite color. I have been coming to this location since 2007 when I was staying at my mother's house to help her out at the end of her life, purchasing products to help with the upkeep of her home. It's still the closest Home Depot to where I stay when I visit the Chandler area so I will keep coming in here whenever I need something.",2008-03-19 20:01:03

I must say my experience was a little underwhelming. Don't get me wrong, Other Mama's was good, just not outstanding. But it might be that my expectations were too high.

First, the good: the pork belly kimchi fried rice was fantastic! Flavorful and served in a hot stone pot, so when you mix the over easy egg into the rice, the pot cooks the egg at the same time. The grilled shrimp salad was also delicious! Would definitely order both of these again.

Next, the rest: the jalapeño hush puppies were a bit bland. There was a kick from the jalapeño but something was missing. The caviar French toast also didn't quite pair up well. I see the intent, trying to balance the saltiness of the caviar with the sweetness of the toast, but for me, it didn't work. And at $19, not worth the price.

It seems that all of the mexican that comes up on my yelp search is always robertos, don tortacos or taco bell.  Really disappointing.  I've also been to the Bonito Michoacan and I'm not super impressed.  I used to live in California, so I just miss those really good, line-out-the-door mexican spots where there's a huge language barrier but the most amazing food ever! 

I have been wanting to try Fausto's for quite some time.  I keep watching the yelp reviews because everyone seems to be a fan, but I wasn't convinced that this place that resembles a robertos could be that great.  I think it's the way the menu looks or something, but it was a difficult one for me to actually give a shot.  

I got a supreme chicken burrito.  It was awesome.  The only thing I didn't like about it, was how it was served for dine in.  I prefer to cut open my burritos and eat them with a fork and knife but the little dish they gave me to eat off of was too small for the burrito and it would have been half sitting on the table.  LOL.  

Their salsa bar is very similar to that of Robertos.  It was comforting that while I was there a ton of mexican families came through and ordered + seemed to be regulars of the place.

Holy hidden gem!!! I have to give MAJOR props to my fiance for finding this place on Yelp for our Thursday date night! 

First, I must start by saying that they are currently BYOB and no corking fee (which I LOVE!) and it makes your bill a lot less at the end of the night. ;) Just don't forget to bring your favorite bottle of vino along with you! 

The FOOD - exotic and heavenly. The flavors were a mix of Thai & Vietnamese (two of my favorites!). To start, we ordered the fresh spring rolls and they were so delish. I loved the light sweet and sour dipping sauce. 

For our entrees, we split the Lemongrass Chicken and next (forgive me, I cannot remember the authentic name) but it was wide egg noodles, stir fried with the most tender beef, shrimp, broccoli, and carrots. The sauce was so delicious, we practically licked the plate! I honestly don't know which dish was my favorite, both were so flavorful and had the most unique blend of spices. The hot sauce that they serve on the side is also fantastic! 

For dessert, we ended with the chilled coconut milk. This had coconut milk, ice, coconut gelatin, jackfruit, and flavored water chestnuts. Interesting but a great palate cleanser! 

WE CANNOT WAIT to come back! Not only is it romantic, it is BYOB, the food is fantastic, and our final bill was $40 WITH tip. The service was very friendly, just not super quick so when you come, plan to relax and spend some quality time with your significant other or friends!

The fresh burrata combo is no longer available from fresh made mozza menu while the lobster spaghetti has entirely disappeared from the pasta section.  I think they replaced the lobster spaghetti with a shrimp spaghetti dish which isn't the same. :-S

This was a bit of a disappointment but we made due and still had a good time there.

The upstairs is much brighter than the downstairs which I prefer but I really have to question the fact that they sat us at a table in front of the storage room or employee access room.  Throughout the dinner, there were people going in and out of the room and they had to be careful opening the door because it could hit the person sitting closest door.  Why have a table there in the first place?

The negroni I ordered was quite tasty and I liked that it was a bit on the sweeter side.  Thanks to that extra dab of sweet vermouth. :-)

I browsed the menu and settled to have the Italian burger and opted for the garlic rosemary fries.  The burger was slightly pink in the middle which was fantastic.  The patty was the right tenderness and the burger toppings were a good compliment.

We had a nice chat with the manager near the end of the meal and again lamented the fact that the burrata and lobster spaghetti were off the menu.  Nothing they could do about it but maybe with enough feedback, they can bring it back! :-)",2017-09-04 15:51:48

I had heard good things about District One so it was great to finally go there the last time I was in town.

We started off with the oxtail fries ($11.99) which we topped with an over easy egg. The fries were crunchy, the oxtail was tender and delicious in its own gravy. I really liked this dish and recommend that you get it. It was really good. Next we had the beef carpaccio ($12.99). It was excellent. My favorite version of beef carpaccio so far. It was perfectly thin ribeye with sesame and citrus flavors. It was just so very good. Ordering this next time for sure. Next were the pork belly buns (3 for $7.99). They were good with the peanut sauce and the braised pork belly was soft and tender. I could have done without the cilantro but that was just standard on the order. Good dish. We also had the oxtail fried rice ($12.99). SO GOOD. So flavorful... You have to order it. Shredded oxtail with all kinds of delicious seasoning with another over easy egg as a topping. Only thing I would change on this dish is add more oxtail for sure. The pics I took doesnt show too much oxtail in it and it could have used some more. Lastly we had the beef and lemongrass wrapped in betel leaves ($7.99). This was my least favorite of all the dishes we had. The lemongrass flavor was too strong IMO. The beef was tender and there were other seasoning flavors I couldnt make out. I would pass on that next time. 

Service was very good. Jeff was excellent. Very personable guy and we appreciated his attentiveness to our party. Kudos to him... Cant wait to eat at District One the next time I'm in town. Heard that whole fried fish dish is the one!

Don't get me wrong, this place has it's good points, I've just had so much better. The decor is fun with it's Frank Sinatra style with a hint of old diner. Of course the menu is themed to accommodate. 

The portions here are HUGE. I mean, the ""bread-sticks"" are ""medium loaves of bread"" huge. The appetizer comes with five of them. FIVE loaves of garlic-y bread. The actual garlic bread was a large loaf cut in half. I was full before the pizza even came. 
I have one big issue with the pizza and it may have been my fault, but our server should have asked. We ordered the deep dish assuming we were going to get Chicago style. Now, either they have two types of deep dish and she gave us the regular one or the deep dish here is terrible. I am willing to admit that maybe, had I asked for Chicago, I may have actually gotten Chicago. However, since the waitress didn't think to ask what kind I wanted, I'm going to operate under the assumption that Danny does not know what deep dish is. It was basically just a moderately deep pizza. Sauce on the bottom, cheese and pepperoni on top. Fine, but NOT deep dish. The crust was what really threw me off though. It was basically bread. I could rip it apart and make a sandwich with it. Good but weird. 

This review is confusing. I'm even confusing myself by reading it over. I apologize and will tell you that the confusion must just be part of Danny boys experience. Now that I know what to expect, maybe I will return and try to have better time.",2015-03-26 16:03:54

Even ordered from the bar so she wouldn't have to wait on us. I think that's pretty unfair. I could understand if I or my friends were making a scene or causing an unsafe environment, but none of that took place. I was extremely disappointed too, because the male bartender, I think his name was William, was awesome. Very polite, great service. He made drinks to perfection! I was going to order food, but was told by another customer not to, that it wasn't very good....and judging from the other reviews about the food, I'm glad I didn't.
Also, I was even told that if she no longer worked there, I would still not be welcome back. Ehhh, it is what it is, Stoney's is better anyway.... just a little further from my house.",2017-01-22 18:56:54

That said, I haven't witnessed any of the complaints of the other reviewer but considering I'm a starving artist not bound to the 9-5 cube-farm rules I'm forced to shop at places like this because the prices generally are much lower than the local and more up-scale Loblaws.

I'll come here and buy sauces, pasta, jared and canned goods, and only some of the produce since better produce deals can be found elsewhere in the city.

Also, I very much enjoy the ethnic diversity that this store caters to.  There are so many wonderful varieties of spices and sauces so if you enjoy cooking (or enjoy eating so much but can't afford restaurants) this is the place to shop for a culinary world tour without having to leave the comforts of your own kitchen.

I've always found the store clean, well stocked without any line-up to speak of.  (Yes I grocery shop weekday mornings!)

Really the only thing I can say against this place is that they do NOT take VISA.  They will take debit or MasterCard.  But sadly my cash-back Visa is sadly refused.

In fact, the Ahwatukee location (now closed) was where I got my 1st job as a server. It's still the place I go when I crave Mexican food, and the place I take everyone from out of town. 
I LOVE the food there- my favorites are the new carne asada stuffed chili relleno's, Machacha quesadilla, carne asada tacos (on corn only), and any of the chimichanga's. Their salsa and bean dip is the best (and the bean dip is the reason other places started serving it with their salsa) and can fill you up. 
With that being said, their food was definitely better in the past. I'm assuming cost cutting measures in this economy hit them a little hard because the chips are different (maybe healthier? they are not as fried as before and if you want them salty you have to put salt on them), and they give smaller amounts of bean dip & salsa than in the past. The food is still as good, although my boyfriend had the seafood sampler last night and despite being fair, it had definitely been frozen. 
What's gotten better? The fried ice-cream. Used to be vanilla ice cream coated in cinnamon corn flakes and fried, but now it's cinnamon ice cream with the same coating and fried.

We started out with a hummus appetizer, which also came with kalamata olives, salted pickles, pepperchinis and shug (which is something new I've never had, a mixture of olive oil, cilantro, garlic and chili flake ground together).  The shug was fabulous!  The hummus was tasty, albeit a little chunky.  I prefer a smoother puree.

My wife ordered the shwarma/gyro combo, while I went with the shwarma plate with 2 side falafel.  The lunch combos came with an Israeli salad, which never arrived at our table.  Hmmm.

My wife found the chicken shwarma and gyro meat to be overcooked and dry.  She also though either the chicken or the mayo-based garlic sauce drizzled over it tasted funny.

I got used to the garlic sauce after a couple of bites, and cleaned my plate.  The falafel looked almost like little muffins, and were pretty good.

We ordered the baklava.  How to describe it in one word?  Dry.  They must have found this bad boy in the Gobi Desert.  Baklava is supposed to be moist with a honey simple syrup, which they must have been short of.

I had to temper my first reaction, which was to call out the kitchen staff and have each of them take a bite while berating them, a-la Gordon Ramsey.  I love that Hell's Kitchen.

I find this place pricey but tasty. Its a great lunch option and I've had most of the dishes on the menu. I can only comment on the RIchmond St location so can't comment on their sushi which is only offered at the Eglinton location.

My favourites are the Mexican wrap (easy on the onions!), the savoury crisp (mostly for the coated fries that come with and that sauce for the meat substitute (I know...mmmm, meat substitute but it actually is really tasty!), the bbq and spring rolls noodle, and when I have someone to share it with, the sweet and sour fireballs with say a shish-kabob reminds me of the good old chinese food red sauce that I've missed since going veggie. 

Disappointing dishes are the veggie burger, pad thai and club sandwich - how strange that a vegan place has a lacklustre veggie burger and pad thai. I do enjoy the soups, the wanton and the thai spicy soup with spring rolls (although the sauce is bland), it makes a nice lunch. 

The decor is strange - very white and clinical with all sorts of vegan propaganda all over - including 2 (or 3?!)

Cashier: James.  Driver: David. Manager: Chris.

I have made about 3 or 4 trips here because it's very convenient.  My friends and co-workers use it and we always recommend it for any of your tree planting needs or desires.  But my last visit was horrible.  I knew walking in what I wanted, I didn't need their deals or 50% off tree/plants.  Not everyone bites at opportunities.  So I walk in and ask for help, James comes out and greets me.  He's a 18 yr old kid, he looked a bit tired/not hangover but obvious he had been up all night prior to my visit.  Whatever, as long as he can keep it professional and help me out.  I have a list of trees I wanted but I ask him what he recommends and give him the type of tree I wanted.  He chooses a tree I had pre-chosen in my research.  Good.  He chooses some plants I've already pre-chosen also, good.  This was literally a 10 minute deal, most people spend 40 mins to an hour+ here being picky.  Not me, I knew what I wanted.  Was this too good for a salesperson?  Probably.

I got a privet, w. jazmines, tree removal, delivery, plant, and stakes.  James rings me up and charges me for everything I wanted and sends me off.  HOLD!  Before you send me away, what's my delivery date?  I know it, cause it's on that calender behind you.  But why is it not scheduled?  Oh hey can I also get flags?  Why am I doing his job?

A week later, delivery/plant day.  I get an early morning call from David the driver and his crew.  I get another call from David when he gets here and says uhhhh where is this Privet going?  I tell him where the flag is at, and he says he doesn't see a tree removal on the receipt and insists on showing me. I told him I paid for it and again he puts the paper in front of me.  I point to the tree cost and tell him it went to the tree cost because a tree that I bought, as small as it was wouldn't cost this much and David hesitantly says he has seen a tree cost this much.  

I understand where David was coming from, if it's not on paper it doesn't exist.  So there was no convincing him to do the work.  I told David I was going to call James at Moon Valley to straighten everything out.  I go inside my house and Juan tells me James will call me back.  So I go outside to wait for James' phone call.  I see David and he's already on the phone but goes behind his truck.

He comes back around and says he just spoke with the manager Chris and says it's going to cost me an additional $150 (cash) on top of what I already paid to have the tree removed.  So I did the police thing and ask the same question in 5 different ways.  Given extra money they can take the tree out.

But I dealt with James, not Chris so Chris wouldn't know what the transactions were and I'm the customer so why wouldn't I be afforded to talk with Chris if there's a dispute?  James calls back and I tell him what's going on and he tells David that I did in fact pay for it and it was his error for not putting it in the notes.

David says he can do it but it's going to cost $40 dollars to remove the tree but I would have to clean it up because he doesn't  have room in the truck.  

Wait, for $150 you were able to do it but not anymore?!

After he tells me that I stand there and think: Did he really ask for $150, untaxed/no receipt from me earlier.  And now after the phone call to verify that the work was paid for he's asking for $40 dollars, untaxed/no receipt from me for taking the dead tree stump out.  I stand there thinking, why are these guys working when David is asking me for cash?  Why is it that it's still going to cost me extra after it's been verified that I paid for everything?   Why would someone, not in a position of manager or higher (not even a cashier) ask this from me?  Will they stop working if I say no?  Why does the Easter bunny lay eggs?  Did it sleep with a chicken?  I thought of all this in about 5 seconds.

I stood there silent and watched them work.  2 options, they stop working or David was trying to earn extra money.  David and I stand next to each other watching  them work for about 2 minutes and he finally asks me for the $40.  I told him I'm going to talk to James so I can speak with Chris because I paid for everything already.  David tells me that he doesn't want unhappy customers and not to worry about it.  I told him I wasn't upset seeing as all this could have been avoided if my purchases have been documented properly.  But i did tell him I was disappointed in his misrepresentation of Moon Valley's business practices.

After the plants and trees were put into place they were about to leave. WAIT! Straighten and stake my tree, I paid for it.  They didn't have any!! They used MY stake from my old tree and a piece of stick and called it a day.

Really disappointed but would still recommend MVN if you can afford it.",2011-05-10 14:22:07

I have never really had a problem here, but from the overall feel I like the *new* one better. It's more classy on the inside. They kept to their classic ice cream flavors, and even have some vegan options. I'm skeptical of anything vegan (because of possible trans fat), but I suppose it's a good option. 

I agree the customer service could be a little better. They didn't wow me with their friendly staff...though there was just one girl in there. She was quiet and not really excited to be there I guess. I did find a flavor that I loved- Salty caramel truffle. Gimme caramel anything and I'll gobble it up. Had it in a waffle cone and I was delighted.

In order to get more stars, I think the staff really need to step up their game and show the customers a wonderful ice cream parlor experience. I see the difference in the staff at Churned vs. Scoops..",2013-06-06 14:05:41

Well, its been 3x now and I can't WAIT to get home and have my leftovers for dinner! 

This place is great - a Kansas City BBQ joint decides to open up 4 mins from me and I couldn't be happier! They have a full menu of BBQ favorites including ribs, pulled pork and chicken and they also have turkey and ham, plus chopped brisket which is really nice. So far I've tried the chicken, beef (chopped brisket), ham, and turkey - its all super juicy and delicious. There is a drive thru with really friendly staff that are happy to walk you through the menu if its your first time there - I recommend the BBQ platters so you can get 2 sides and a couple of meats to enjoy (or make 2 meals out of, as I like to do). 

I wouldn't say there are many downsides. I'd like to see a veggie option as a side - green beans would be great - but they have the standard ones like Mac n Cheese, coleslaw and beans. Also, they don't put much sauce on their meat - but they also don't offer up sauce on the side so you have to request it. The first time, I didn't know better and my turkey was a little bland without some sauce to help. I really like their Hot BBQ though, just the right amount of heat. 

Highly recommend, great location and nice folks that serve up delicious, fast BBQ - check it out.",2016-11-01 15:52:34

She took my drink order while we enjoyed the complimentary warm yummy bread. I placed an order of wild mushroom medley so the timing would coincide while Arturo carved  my request of the Lawry's bone in prime rib cut and plated my mixed cream corn &  spinach, mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. The prime rib was delish, tender and flavorful - it was that moment I realized why I unconsciously wanted to dine here!  All the sides were perfect and the wild mushrooms were incredible.

Never happened. 

Food was very mediocre. My grapefruit juice tasted like from a mix rather than fresh. Sugary sweet red syrupy liquid. Scrambled eggs not fluffy but more of a layer of egg on a pan that got rolled onto itself. Avocado served on the side was hard as a rock (unripe) and brown on edges like it was sitting out.

My first opportunity, I made an order online and picked-up on my way to class. However, I was a little let down.

First, my online order was not ready at the designated time, despite it not being busy. Someone just dropped the ball. Oh well, slightly annoying, but forgivable as there was no one else in line and I could oversee the construction of my bowl.

The fajita mix (peppers and onions) looked a little old and over-cooked. It happens sometimes and I figured that I just got there after a lull. No biggie. 

When it came time to leave, there was confusion about how to use the system, as it was a pre-paid online order. It took about a minute to clear up, but was thinking that for a brand-new location the staff should be better trained. Still, I calmed myself and ran through my imaginative happy place where Chipotle guacamole runs in rivers and their salty-lemony chips grow on trees.

However, the the final let down arrived when I started eating the barbacoa bowl. The barbacoa was rather dry and clumped together--immune to even repeated stabbings and twistings with a fork. Nothing could de-tangle it. I had to eat it more like meat on a stick style, which was actually a  little bit of a turn off and made for a unsatisfied Chipotle experience.

Put together, I was let down. I was expecting more for a brand new location. Perhaps the staff needs more time to get into the groove of things and maybe Chipotle should step up their training program a bit too.

I'll be back again soon to see how things have progressed, but please don't let me down again! My heart (and stomach) just couldn't handle it.",2012-01-12 20:35:48

On the sides of my nails, you can see teal specks next to the coral polish that I chose. My manicure was not painted close to the cuticle, so it looked like I already had a week of nail growth. Also, my gel polish chipped only after two days. I definitely don't think the gel is worth it if it doesn't even last one full week. The application of the gel polish was uneven and very thick. My pedicure was decent, but it was nothing to rave about. Not much time was taken and it was okay. The only thing I liked was the variety of polish colors.

If you like seafood this is definitely the dish for you! The Bolognese is also an excellent choice.

The overall facility is clean, well staffed, with a relaxing atmosphere.  There is a small assortment of yoga and spa gear in the lobby to shop or kill time while waiting for a class. The yoga classroom is just the right size for a small-medium sized class.  It can get a little crowded for the more popular classes, but it still feels welcoming.  The room is not kept in the usual air conditioned deep freeze (which I appreciate), so your muscles can remain warm and loose.  I don't really enjoy the extreme heat of Bikram, so this is a nice compromise.  I don't know how this will fair during the Phoenician summers, but for now I am enjoying.

I pretty much only go to Vegas to climb at Red Rocks National Conservation Area, so I try and minimize my interaction when possible with the gambling/party scene.

Sometimes you just have sing like no one is listening and bob down the street with your balloon like no one's watching...or pointing...or taking pictures of the freak.

Husband is not the *biggest* art museum fan (tho I'm slowly chipping away at him), so I was over-the-moon when he turned to me with a big grin on his face after paying a visit to the MFAM and announced how much he loved the place.  And for the AD/HD-afflicted gent that he is, MFAM's installation art exhibits are perfect.  They allow for you to walk through, participate, operate, or touch just about all of them, drawing you in and literally making you part of the art.

MFAM's two galleries -- the former Stearns & Foster mattress factory on Sampsonia and a row home a couple blocks away on Monterey -- house a small but powerful collection.  The permanent collection includes transsexual and drug addicted Greer Lankton's sensory stimulating ""It's All about ME, Not You""; double mirrored-rooms plastered with polka dots that invite you to dance or make silly faces by Yayoi Kusama; and the sensory *depriving*, pitch black art of James Turrell, punctuated unexpectedly by colored light.  

For its temporary exhibits, MFAM brings artists from all over the world to Pittsburgh, sets them up in their very own artists' residences, and gives them free reign over their own gallery space in one of the museum's two buildings.  The result is thrilling (Jeremy Ficca's hovering floorboards), amusing (Gill Wildman's ""House Says"", in which he stenciled cheeky phrases and sayings all over the walls, doors, and even the exterior of 1414 Monterey), and poignant, like ""Wish Exchange Dandelion"" by Ling He.  Enter the room full of crystal-colored balloons dangling ribbon tails from the ceiling and realize the ribbons are covered with the hopes and dreams of patrons who've come before you: ""I wish my sister could stop doing drugs,"" ""I want my son to be happy and healthy,"" ""I hope Obama wins in 2012""...write your own wish on a balloon's ribbon and leave it behind; but only if you take someone else's with you.  I left my dream behind and took, ""I wish I was artistic"" with me on our walk back through the Mexican War Streets and Allegheny Commons.

The restaurant is outside hill crest mall and used to be a Krispy Kreme many years ago. All re-modeled now, kind of a combination of a restaurant and coffee shop. They also have free wi-fi so there were a lot of students doing homework there. The menu is basically sandwiches, soup and salads. You order at the counter and they bring you the food to your table. Here's the good:

- They post the calories on the menu. I think this is fantastic and wish more places would do so. I changed what I was going to order when I noticed my chosen sandwich was 1,000 calories - crazy.
- Soups are good. I had a low fat black been soup which was very good... assuming you like black beans.
- My turkey sandwich was pretty good. They had a combo mayo / mustard spread that I enjoyed. The sandwich was made with rye bread and stuffed with turkey (it's processed meat though).
- My wife had the Turkey and cranberry panini which was rather good.
- You can get your soup in a bread bowl - I love eating my bowl after soup!
- The food came out fast.
- The restaurant was clean and so were the washrooms. Lot's of parking.

And the not so good...

- Didn't like the french onion soup - it's a poor imitation.
- I must admit, I don't get doing homework at restaurants. Although there were many tables, at least 3/4""s were full of people there for free wifi. I can easily see  not getting a seat to eat during a busy time.

I was really looking forward to this round, having seen a number of excellent reviews.  Yes, it's in the middle of summer and scorching in Vegas, but I figured I could keep hydrated and tough it out.  Plus, the deal on GolfNow was great.  

So I get to the pro shop and Jose, who was simply awesome for letting my wife ride along complimentary, tells us that the course is shutting down in two days for two weeks because of re-seeding-thus the discount on GolfNow. Anyway, the course is situated in the most beautiful part of the Las Vegas area, near Red Rock. We get out to the first tee and you can see that the fairways are dried out and grated in preparation for the re-seeding.  I figured, no biggie, golf is golf.  

So we played if a ball landed in a spot that was chewed up due to maintenance, we could move it.  Yes, it is a tough course, lots of hazards.  Very nice, typical desert course. LOTS of sand traps, especially protecting a lot of the greens.  Not the best desert course I have ever seen, but nice.  The best thing, to me, was the personal instruction on each hole from Jack on the GPS.  Absolutely great idea and something I had never seen before. My big negative was that there were so many holes he used from the same courses throughout this course. For example, he used holes from Desert Highlands in Arizona a number of times. I actually anticipated 18 absolutely different holes and maybe to someone who is into golf architecture could see that, but I didn't see it that way.  Yes, there were some very distinct holes here, but not enough.  Can't remember which hole it was, but there was a split fairway on one that was similar to one at PGA West.  Great setup.  But just not enough of those.
Greens were okay, not too difficult yet not easy whatsoever. However, not enough people are repairing their divots.  Is this because they know the course is closing for maintenance?  Lazy bums.

Most amateurs like me should play this course from no longer than the blues, it is more than 7,000 from the gold.  But from Jose in the pro shop, which is small but nice, to Edwin, who was so nice and respectful and helpful, everyone we met was terrific and treated us very well.  And thanks to truck driver Tom of North Carolina for the awesome company and great round of golf. Be safe out there.

I would give this 4 stars if not for the condition of the course. I am absolutely willing to give this course another shot, but I think I will wait until the fairways are green again.  Like in the spring.",2012-08-21 17:11:11

Maybe one of the best decisions of my life- okay that's an exaggeration- but these tacos are everything I wanted and so much more. I've been to Mexico many times and have had amazing food- and these were on par. 
I was not expecting la plaza to be such an expansive grocery. They have aisles upon aisles of authentic Mexican fare. Stuff you would probably have a hard time finding elsewhere. I'd love to say I looked around more, but I was on a one track taco mission, glancing briefly at the snacks and cans and fresh produce, heading straight to the back of the store. 
There is the holy grail, a small lunch counter where they're grilling up meats of all kinds for some authentic taco lovin. I'm going to be honest, we went a little crazy. Tacos el pastor, chorizo, carnitas, wrapped in double fresh tortillas, we ordered them all. They come ""naked"" so you're able to dress them up with the topping you'd like at the little cart right next to the counter. I'm a traditionalist so I dressed mine with onions, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime, but they also had some salsas you could use as well. 
If you couldn't already tell by the enthusiasm, they were delicious. Every single one was awesome. The chorizo was my favorite, but I would happily order any of them again. Do yourself a favor and wash them down with a Mexican coke. 
What came next I can only describe as post taco euphoria. We decided to take this flavor party home with us and bought everything. Homemade chips, corn tortillas, tamales, house made guacamole and fresh salad. We stopped by the butcher counter and got marinated meat to cook at home. We got thres leche out of the bakery fridge. Oh and why not some Mexican beer. 
I think we ate Mexican for the next four days. But I do not regret one single minute of it. Everything we bought was of great quality and equally great taste. 
I consider myself lucky for finding this spot. Just writing this review has me craving some chorizo tacos.",2015-03-09 17:05:21

After reading about the singing wait staff, my wife and I wanted to check this place out just for kicks. When a couple friends wanted to go to the top of the Stratosphere tower, it was a perfect opportunity to eat at Roxy's.

It is in the casino just inside the south tower entrance? which isn't far from a nearby Deuce stop. We went on a wednesday morning around 10:30 am and there were only a handful of other tables taken. We were seated right away and given menus and brought fresh coffee. I noticed right away that the place was clean and the decor was pretty cool with shiny chrome and neon much like a diner from the 50s.

I ordered texas style french toast with a side of sausage, my wife had an omelet with spinach, feta, and provolone, with 2 glasses of OJ. Our 2 guests each had a BLT with  fries and 2 sodas.

Everything was served fairly quick and the food was very good. My french toast was thick and filling, the sausage was hot and tasty. My wife's omelet was big and covered in spinach and cheese. The BLTs that were ordered were both too big to eat they had to take them apart.

We all agreed this was a good meal. When we received the check we were surprised to see the total was just over 40 dollars for the 4 of us. That is less than what we paid for breakfast for 2 in another place that wasn't nearly as good as this. Just goes to show you don't have to spend a fortune in Vegas to get a good meal. I am so tired of hearing people justify spending way too much money on average food or drink by saying ""well, it is Vegas"". This was good food for not alot of money, so there!

The atmosphere is great - especially if you like Irish Pubs as much as I do. Service was very good too - we met our friends at the bar - and before we had our coats off the bartender was asking if he could get us anything! (good man!) Dinner was pretty good. I had the Prime Rib special (Saturday night). I got the 10 oz and it seemed huge. Mine was a bit over cooked but it was still decent. I opted for Erin's Colcannon which is mashed potatoes with sauerkraut in it. It was OK, but I don't think I would get again. Wife had the Ruben sandwich and said it was good. Looked delicious.

Tickets were moderately priced (buy one at $39.95 and get the second ticket free.)   On the bottom of the ticket there was a buy one get one free coupon for a drinks at Dixies Dam Bar, where the show is performed.

I had my first oatmeal shot and YUM! If anyone knows how to make those please toss me the recipe. The waitresses were very friendly and knew the specials backward and forward. 

The show started right on time. Not many people were there to so we were about 4 rows back.  Seating was awkward and we had to strain to see some of the show. 

 The men...oh the men...one (Caleb) was scorching hot.  A couple were sexy and the others just weren't to my taste.  The men have military, cowboy and greek god themed skits.  The dancing is sexy but one of the skits was actually funny.  One man dons a wolf mask while the other is dressed as a vampire...and its not in a sexy Lautner way. Silly themed skit, loss of star one.

They pulled  women on stage a few times to participate in the show up close and very personally.

Here is where a the second star is lost.  This really irritated me.
Twice during the show the guys come into the crowd and grind  right in front of you and expect you to slip dollar bills into their boxer breifs.  I had no problem doing that for the sexy guys that I was enjoying but when one of the guys that I wasn't enjoying grinded in front of me he actually opened his pants for me to slide a dollar in. I don't like feeling like I am being pressured to tip some dudes junk after I have purchased a ticket so I said nope and he grinded on about his business on a different woman,

After the show the Men of X  pose for pictures.  I'm not sure how much that costs.  I hung around with some friends in Dixies bar after the show and snapped a picture for free as one of the guys was heading out.

Overall it was a fun show.  I didn't expect much and had a good time.",2011-02-28 13:44:13

This outlet is located on the west side of Rainbow Blvd, just north of Windmill Road. I must have driven past here a couple of hundred times before finally giving it a try last night.

 Meh. I've experienced better.

That is truly a good way to sum it up. 

- For all the complaints I see about rudeness or lack of customer service, I did not experience that at all. If anything, the employees were very polite and respectful. I heard lots of ""sirs"" and ma'ams"" as they were helping other patrons.

- Bottom line: the chicken is just too damn greasy! It was downright slimy and slipped around on my plate. Gross. 

All we got was the chicken, so I cannot give an opinion on any of the sides. 

With Popeye's further north on Rainbow and KFC opening very soon right up the road, I just don't think this is a great place to go for your fried chicken fix.

Cocktails - sound good on paper, but I wasn't particularly impressed by my Batida or Tokyo Schooner. The bartenders pour with a heavy hand, so I still ended the night on quite a high note...but I guess I like my drinks tasting a little more like the mixers and a little less like the alcohol. 

Scallop - 5 stars. Self-proclaimed pescatarian? Not anymore! I just ate all the bacon on top...and I don't feel guilty at all!

I wanted to go there so bad and had a bit of a vision of what it might look like, and boy was I wrong. Vietnamese restaurants are always dirty, run down, and seemingly ill-maintained. Lee's couldn't be any different, it's clean, shiny, and efficient. Ordering takes place at the counter, and they have about 20+ sandwiches you can choose from, both american and vietnamese. Vietnamese are under $3 and american are over $4 and not nearly as delicious. 

I wasn't courageous enough to try the signature Lee's Combonation, because it has Head Cheese (it's not cheese) and I'm kind of a pussy when it comes to that stuff. I had decided before I went that I would have the Grilled Pork, they were out, so as a back up I ordered the BBQ pork, which they were out of. I settled for Shredded Pork, and it was fairly good.

I'm going to go back and order something that fits my tastes, but as of now based on my experience there, it's only 3 stars.

Nevertheless, if you're connected to the ""PATH"" (eg. College Park 1, 2,777 Bay, College Park Suites, College subway station) that means you can get here entirely indoors while wearing flipflops and tshirts in the middle of winter.

When I saw jajangmyeon on the menu, I knew that was what I was getting. For $8.50+HST, it's a filling meal of noodles topped with a fried egg. It's not salty and it doesn't have MSG that would leave a dry taste in your mouth. It's just good and done right.

If you stare at the menu, the owner will come out and recommend the Combo A, B or C to you. I'd still go with the jajangmyeon everytime but somehow it feels very un-foodcourt-like for people to approach and tell you about their menu. Is it because we're in Aura's dead/dying mall? Or maybe it's because their family-owned business business depends on them trying harder than a typical chain fast food employees.

And once you do order, grab a seat! They'll serve it straight to your table.

There was barely enough food for one person let alone two.

LCCJjwzDqkWChEH5qxROzA,dgVJzkjTHapHRloRKYv4bA,F2ZWxWi_Ci8nyRiXA0WS4Q,1,1,1,0,"OMG I think this might be the nastiest grocery store I have ever been to in my entire life. Let me pre-face this by letting you know I've been to a great many of Food 4 Less and none have been this disgusting. Anyways let me get on with this review. I went into the store to pick up two specific items because friends and family have told me I should be able to find them at Food 4 Less. The first item pick up jicama the other was rutabaga. Now that you have this general information and let's get to the high and low points of my visit. Let's start with high points because there's only one! 

Pros: 1) They had both items I was looking for. So know I know what each of these vegetables look like (prior to peeling, skinning, dicing etc.) Yay!!!! 

Cons: 1) The Jicama had so many fruit flies around it i could even bring my self to buy it. 
2) the tomatoes next to the jicama looks dang near rotten (hence the fruit flies) 
3) the rutabaga looked decent bc it was in the wet/ refrigerated area (however so many things looked so poorly cared for I was also scared to buy it) 
4) the other customers.... Um looked of ""questionable character"" (ie hold your purse close) 
5) the overall cleanliness looked subpar!!!! 

Honestly I never made it past the produce section because I got the he-be-gee-bees and kept thinking flies were on me. I seriously hi-tailed it outta this place because the produce area looked so bad. Shame on the stock people and mangers at this location. Near have I seen produce look this bad. And I mean I have been to outdoor produce stands that didn't have flies or even half as many flies as I saw in this store. Truly shameful!!! Especially because they had my items but I was to grossed-out to purchase them.",2014-06-04 00:54:41

Peppers, mushrooms, avocados, cilantro, and a corn salsa. The salsa was quite vinegary, but I am in to fermented foods and I am wondering if the salsa was fermented...That would make it even healthier.

The foods here are similar to Mandarin, and comparable in the variety to some degree. The restaurant even has a teppanyaki area that lets you make a stir-fry fresh, sirloin steak, and other seafood.

The biggest problems with the restaurant is the layout and food quality. The restaurant is a larger buffet, so it allows for more people in there, and more space to move. That hinders this buffet because the food is spread out in weird places and you can't find what you want. As well, the food is mass produced to a larger extent since it accommodates to larger number of consumers. All the dishes I tried were horrible, and the one gimmick of the teppanyaki was bland and disappointing.

The teppanyaki area leaves raw meat out in the open, and one can only suppose what germ filled hands and young children can do to that.

There is also free bottled water and free fountain drinks on the side, but honestly it takes very minimal charge to supply soft drinks.

Price: too expensive for the quality of the food, the prices aren't staggering, but considering the quality of the food it feels like you are overpaying for nearly everything

Drinks: beer is one of the strengths of Harris, always a good selection of draft beers, and an extensive bottle beer list, the mixed drinks are all average to below average though and the bartenders do not mix good drinks, aside from the signature Frozen Cosmo I would stay away from everything, including the mojito

Atmosphere: this is what you pay for at Harris, they have a beautiful porch for outdoor seating in the front, an equally nice back porch, and the inside decor is pleasant as well, the menus are very cleverly organized and a lot of personality was put into the presentation

Service: the service is average at best, we have had meals and specific orders confused multiple times, service is also slow

If you are in no rush to get to your hotel, this is the best, most inexpensive way to go.  However, there are like 12 people in the shuttle & they are going to other hotels too so there will be numerous stops.  It took about 30 minutes to get to TI from the airport.  In addition, the driver skipped Harrah's to drop off those at TI first which really irked the passengers out.

He said, ""Don't be silly. Take your time. No need to hurry."" What???  Anyway, on to the food.  Good food, interesting menu, with some unique dishes. Started with the deep fried deviled eggs. It was a nice twist to a classic dish, but lacked enough flavor punch to make it something truly special. The grilled cheese and bacon cheddar biscuits were tasty comfort food.

The waitress we got was so polite and lovely, and it was busy, yet we weren't waiting longer than the ordinary time.. 

The selection on the menus was really good, and the drinks selection looked delicious! Pictures too, to help visualise the dishes, which is always a help 

The food was so fresh and mouthwatering! Myself and my fiancé ordered clam chowder and they brought out what looked like scones, but it was garlicky bread which was so soft and fluffy! The clam chowder was so rich in flavour! I only ordered a cup portion and himself ordered a bowl, which had biscuits with both.. 
Next we ordered a trio with a side of lobster mash, and I ordered garlic lobster linguini 
All in all, amazing!!

My fiancé ordered 2 mojitos and I ordered a spiked strawberry lemonade, which didn't taste much like strawberry but was so refreshing nonetheless and you get to keep the glass afterward! (Which has the red lobster logo across it) 
Our bill came to $112 which wasn't bad considering we ordered lobster, alcohol and I asked for a portion of lobster mash extra cause it was too nice 
Would recommend it and will go back",2016-05-01 20:31:49

The barista even brought my drink out to me and the place was packed.  Nice gesture.  The *only* thing that bugs is parking.  But then again, welcome to Shaker Square, right?  Dewey's has a sign outside that says free parking in the back.  I didn't find said parking.  All I could find was a ""loading only"" zone that would have towed my car between 8am and 4pm.

Luckily for me, I came on a good night.

It was a Tuesday evening around 5:30-5:45 and there were no customers, so it was peaceful. A little while after us, a party of 5 adults and a child arrived. No one else showed up during the little over an hour we were there. Two couples however, did arrive just as we were leaving. 

So... good for us because it was a nice, semi-quiet evening and we could take in the whole restaurant, But I would have to say it was a bad night if you're the restaurant owner. 

I guess that's why they're dropping Groupons for Havana Café like they're hot. We had a Groupon. I admittedly just now bought Another Groupon for HC when we got home because we thought the place was great.

We started with an order of tostones and a cup of the seasonal Pumpkin Bisque. The tostones weren't the best I've had. Not quite as crispy as I like. The inside seemed a little under cooked. Not bad though, just okay. The mojo, garlic, lime juice-sauce that comes with them on the other hand, was very good. 

The Pumpkin Bisque was excellent. They make it in-house with pumpkins they buy at the local markets. They only have it for a limited time, so if you want to try it, I would recommend doing it soon.

For my entrée, I went with the Bistec Encevollado. It's a marinated steak with onions and I had it with rice and black beans. I thought it was very good and it was a big portion. I packed  1/2 of it to-go so I could delve into their desserts.

I saw the Pumpkin Flan when we first looked over the menu, and there was no way I was leaving without trying it. We also had a mini coconut flan and a mini chocolate pudding. 

The Pumpkin Flan was like eating the filling of a pumpkin pie without having to deal with the crust. That was perfect for me since I don't favor pie crust. It was topped with either a brown sugar or apple butter sauce, I'm not sure. The sauce was labelled as a brown sugar sauce in the menu, but it wasn't super sweet. Not a bad thing, the dessert as a whole was good. 

The coconut flan was another winner. It had a nice, clean, fresh flavor and shredded coconut on top. I think it also had a light lemon sauce on it. Very good.

The chocolate bread pudding wasn't bad. It had a chocolate rum sauce and on it and there was no mistaking that there was rum in it. A good dessert if you're craving chocolate and don't mind rum. 

This was my first Cuban food experience in Phoenix and I'm very pleased. I don't have any solid complaints. I can see how parking could be an issue, but I can walk here from my place so that isn't an issue for me. 

I will definitely be back. Actually, according to my new Groupon I'll be back by November 25th.",2013-10-30 03:11:33

We were there on the infamous first Saturday, however, and I understand that there may be early glitches, and other excuses for Marvel to have robbed us of $100+. 

Here's another reason they suck: my husband was injured in one of the only experiences that was functional that day. I will fully admit that it was his fault, thinking he could be more flexible than his frame allows. The security and EMT staff were very kind and prompt. The husband ended up in the ER, but fortunately his injuries were not too serious. However, what appalls me is that they did not follow up with a phone call to either me or my husband when several staff members emphatically said they would, in order to make sure he was ok.

My overall 4 star review was me being generous since they are new to the area:

Atmosphere: 4 out of 5 stars! The salon is beautifully decorated and quiet which makes for good relaxation.

Cleanliness: 4 out of 5 stars! I love that they line their pedicure tubs. Everything is also organized well.

Wait time: 3.5 out of 5 stars! I've heard from other neighbors that they get busy so best time to come is right when they open. I had to wait like 30min mid morning, which is not bad.

Skills: 2.5 out of 5 stars! My neighbors have commented that most of the nail techs they had did an amazing job but I must have got the bad apple because although she was friendly her skills were lacking. Nail cut crooked, polish not covering whole nail (polish on edges in some areas were uneven), polish on skin....it was hard to communicate to the nail tech because she did not speak any English at all....so she had no idea what I wanted fixed.....keep in mind that I am the least picky customer they could have had because I used to work in the service industry so I do not like to complain.

Customer service: 5 out of 5 stars! Upon the receptionist finding out about my dissatisfaction, they immediately had my nail tech try to fix my crooked nail. I dunno why but even with the other staff telling her how to fix it in her language....she still cut the low side even lower leaving the other side of the nail higher.....it got to the point that another nail tech had to fix it for her himself to try to get my nail as even as possible. He did an amazing job fixing her mess...her mistake is still noticeable but he fixed it to the point of it being tolerable. Even though my nail tech was not good at pedicures when it comes to clipping and polish she did give me the most amazing massage and exfoliation on my calves.

Price: 5 out of 5! Their prices are lower than most of the salons I frequent in the area. A deluxe pedi is only $37.

Like I said, overall I had a great experience. Next time I will just make an appointment with a nail tech who I know can provide detail oriented work. The staff as a whole are very attentive and friendly which makes me feel like I should give them a chance and try it out again.",2017-07-22 07:00:48

I recently tried the food here and was not impressed. I ordered the seafood pasta which was a huge portion. Probably could feed 3. The price was around $15.
The first thing I noticed about the dish was how salty the sauce was. This was seriously the most salty sauce I have ever tried!! The saltiness completely killed the dish for me. I let my friend have the rest of my dish because I gave up trying to enjoy it and she was also shocked by the saltiness. 
The seafood inside was cooked just fine. Maybe could have been cooked a little less and the noodles also just fine. 
One thing I didn't like was the upsell on drinks. When I eat out I like to order tap water with lemon. They said they don't give free water and only sell it by the bottle. -_-. I ended up purchasing a CAN of soda (means no refills) for $3.50! 
If you're going to serve food that salty, you should at least provide ice water so I'm not dehydrated after the meal. 

I'll be back here but just for the dancing and maybe a glass of wine or cocktail here. I will not come here for  the food! The gross pasta dish and the no free water policy completely scared me away.",2016-08-16 18:54:39

My main issue with the brunch is that there is no a la carte option. You have to order 'all you can eat', of which they offer 3 options. The cheapest ($9) is pastries and fruit, the middle option ($13 I think) includes pastries, fruit, and one level of entrees, like red velvet pancake, omelette, french toast, etc. The highest option ($19) includes all the above plus their specialty dishes like eggs benedict, steak and eggs, etc. That sounds like a decent deal, but seriously, who is going to eat more than one breakfast entree?? So basically, you are stuck paying $19 for an eggs benedict or $13 for a pancake. The food is good and creative, and I could really tell that the banana muffins and cheese danishes were made in house.

The buffet mindset applies to the drinks, as well, with mimosas and bloody marys available only as all you can drink for $15 and $12, respectively.

Service was friendly and efficient, refilling our mimosas promptly and giving us some spaces since we had a cranky baby with us.

We both think that it's run by the same people who used to run Captain's Galley in the same location and that they just chose more of a country cooking type menu for this venture.

All in all it's what you would expect menu wise with daily specials and sides as well as ones that are available everyday.  There is a section of the menu with fried/broiled seafood, one with Italian dishes and the standards like country style steak, fried chicken, chicken livers and onions as well as various sandwiches and a couple burgers.

My wife had the country style steak which is served on rice.  It needed a good dose of salt and pepper at the table but the chopped steak was tender, pretty tasty and there was plenty of it.  I had a combo of fried fantail shrimp and fried oysters which were both big and plump, not too heavily breaded and served crispy and piping hot with fries, hushpuppies and coleslaw. Again, a lot of food for the price and it was good.

I was a little worried when I walked in the line was practically at the door! But everyone was friendly, the line was moving fast and as a newbie it gave me time to see other folks salads and decide on my very first one. 

So many choices it's easy to get overwhelmed. But what I really liked is that the staff explains everything to you and you can easily make additions or substitutions to your custom salad as needed. 

I decided to go with the Chopped salad because it basically had so many yummy ingredients I couldn't pass up. It's packed with chicken, ranch smoked bacon, an egg, blue cheese and tomatoes. I switched the dressing out for the Mexican Goddess and if your a fan of salad dressing's with a little kick I'd absolutely recommend it. Don't worry, you can sample the dressing before they out it in AND they ask you to let them know how much dressing you'd like on your salad. (Yep, you're totally winning here). 

Just watching them make the salads is cool but what's better is that they are a good size portion with fresh and tasty ingredients.

From start to finish, I was completely blown away by Beckett's Table.

Beckett's Table is a type of restaurant I would expect to find in Beverly Hills or Hollywood, not in the desert city of Phoenix. BT has only been open a month but the owners have done an amazing job making sure this establishment runs like a well oiled machine that has no chinks in its chains. In fact, there is no way I would have known that BT has only been open a month if I was not told by our waiter. The inside of BT is dimly lit and has modern and rustic décor. Even though the place was extremely busy, my fiancé and I were able to grab two seats at one of their communal tables near the bar area. Right when we were seated we received complimentary warm wheat and white rolls with super creamy butter. These rolls were fantastic, especially the wheat ones which were really soft and sweet.

BT's menu is made up of classic comfort foods with a twist. My fiancé and I started the evening by ordering three appetizers. These are the apps we ordered:
Creamy Grits with Spicy Andouille Sausage in a Mustard Au Jus
Beckett's Grilled Cheese Sandwiches with Four Cheeses, Pancetta and Roasted Red Pepper Tomato Soup
Bacon Cheddar Biscuits with Apple Honey Butter

All three of these apps were delicious. The creamy grits were indeed creamy and contained lots of juicy, semi spicy sausage, tomatoes and grilled onions. The mustard au jus that was on the grits was also extremely flavorful. The little grilled cheese Sammie's were super cheesy and also somewhat salty because of the pancetta. The roasted red pepper soup was also really tasty. The bacon cheddar biscuits were warm, fluffy and had a nice bacon-y flavor. 

For dinner I ordered their chicken and dumplings entrée while my fiancé ordered the fork tender short rib. The chicken and dumplings was served in a big bowl and contained juicy pieces of chicken, soft and squishy dumplings, peas, carrots, celery and an extremely flavorful herb saffron cream sauce. This dish brought back so many memories because as a child my dad used to make chicken and dumplings at least once a month. After him and my mom divorced when I was about 12 or 13, for some reason he never made them again. BT's chicken and dumplings was just as wonderful as the ones I ate as a child. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. 
The name of my fiancés dish perfectly described it. The fork tender short rib really was fork tender. It was also huge and incredibly tasty. The big short rib was placed on a bed of fluffy mashed potatoes, green beans and a wonderful red wine herb reduction sauce. 

For dessert I got a slice of their fig and pecan pie with a scoop of citrus zest ice cream and my fiancé got their bacon s'mores plate. My fig pecan pie, which won a Phoenix pie contest not long ago, was amazing. It tasted so much different than a normal pecan pie. The figs gave it such a different flavor and texture. The citrus zest ice cream was also unique and tasted wonderful. My fiancés bacon s'mores dessert was phenomenal. Forget the s'mores you make while camping, BT's s'mores blow those boring things out of the water. BT's s'mores plate comes with graham crackers, toasted homemade marshmallows, chocolate covered bacon and homemade creamy peanut butter that has caramel sauce drizzled on top of it.  All of these components come on a plate and it is up to you to put it all together in s'more form. It's funny because Scott Stephens (one of the owners) personally came over to us and said that my fiancé was the first person he had seen actually take the time and build a s'mores sandwich instead of just eating all the elements with a fork. BT's s'mores are by far the best s'mores I have ever had. They were sweet, salty and crunchy all at the same time. 

The service at BT was fantastic. Our server Josh was incredible. He was super friendly, funny and attentive. He talked to us about their menu, gave us suggestions on what to try and what his favorite dishes were and even joked around with us every time he checked up on us. Actually, everyone at BT was extremely friendly and they all seemed to enjoy working at BT. 
The prices here were great too. Our entire bill was less than $80 dollars, which I thought was great considering all the food we ordered. 

If you're ever in Phoenix then I highly recommend you pay a visit to Beckett's Table. This place is absolutely amazing and I look forward to the day I return to Phoenix so I can eat at BT again.",2010-12-08 17:16:30

I had the ""build your own"" w/ green chile, carmelized onions wheat bun and the works - could not have asked for a better burger. I chose the regular meat, no upgrade, but it was great. The zuch fries are ok but the green bean fries are amazing. Dipped them in the chipotle mayo. I would give 5 stars but their normal fries were actually pretty average, but that is minor.

My friends showed up and were kind of scared though they haven't been out with me for ages so it would be an adventure for them. Ill dodge bullets for a good bite to eat and they know it! 

Burgers, fries shakes and a few odds and ends on the menu well, here it goes. Ordered a half pound burger with cheese and a side of fries, 4.99 as well as a strawberry milkshake.. I was making sure we all ordered what they are known for, good burgers, fries and shakes.. okay, so I'm blown away! The burger was totally juicy without being greasy.. the fries were crispy and flavorful and the shake tasted like it should have.. thick, creamy and fruity! My friends all LOVED the food here and were thanking me on the way out.. so much for it being scary. 

Lucky Boy rocks! The burgers remind me of how a good burger should be, simple, tasty and cheap. Now that's American!",2008-05-28 03:17:17

With that in mind it's a very classy venue and I've seen the bar and cocktail hour set up outside the ballroom so there is that excuse to talk and roam which is perfect. 

The food is delicious.  One event had a poutine bar (which I'm sure is a custom request) but everything there was so tasty.  They even made a vegetarian gravy for me and my kinfolk.

It was a nice day so I sat on the patio.  It's cramped and I always felt like someone strolling down the sidewalk could grab my stuff and run.  Not a fan of that.  I primarily chose to sit outside because it was really noisy inside.  I know it's a small pub so the noise level was not a surprise, but I didn't have the energy to yell my conversation that day.  

I ate the half Taco Salad with chicken and holy toledo, that was a spicy meal.  It was really good though but it certainly wouldn't be for everyone.  I think the house dressing for it was almost as hot as the jalapenos, but I would order it again.  My spouse ate the Gorilla Burger, which was gigantic.  I took a bite and the patties were flavorful.  He thought it was decent and was enjoying the fried egg.

This is my favourite spot for some basic, traditional wing flavours. Goodbye Crabby Joes, you will be missed.

When the place first open they had ipads that you could use to order the items you wanted if you couldn't get hold of a server right away. That idea tanked, b/c I've returned a couple of times already and see no ipads to be found. I betcha the staff lucked out and got an ipad for free.

The wings here are very flavourful and simple. They remind me of chips b/c one you have one you can't stop. I will say however the wings are very small and when I mean small, I mean I've ate 50 wings, twice, during my visits here. The sad part is I was still hungry after those 50 wings, I only stopped b/c eating more than 50 wings in one sitting is disgusting. 

The service is very good and consistant. Staff are constantly checking up on you and refilling drinks without even asking if you want more, of course alcoholic drinks are the exception on free refills. However the wait time for food sucks, for wings it took about 15-20mins to come out. But I already expected that b/c I've been to so many B-Dubs, Buffalo Wild Wings nickname btw, in the States that the wait time for food is consistently slow. So eat a snack b4 heading into B-Dubs.

Lastly there are alot of screens to watch your favourite team, and for once all the screens are a mix of all kinds of games not like most sports bars in Canada that only play hockey games on their screens. :-).

If you want wings this is the place to go for something flavourful and traditional. Tuesdays is their wing night where wings are 55 cents each and for all you Maple Leaf fans, if the Leafs are playing you can get 20 wings and 2 beers for $20.

Items to definitely get:

- garlic parmesan
- buffalo
- mango habenero

I've only been going for the past two months I guess after they changed over to EOS but I have no complaints as I am new to going to the gym in general and have only been to two other gyms in the past and this one is much better. I feel like a lot of people who complain are griping about the old gym vs the new but because I have fresh eyes I see nothing wrong. Kind of crowded like all gyms of this price range and if you come at rush hour (obvs). I guess it's cool how they have a basketball court and pool and that they offer a membership that allows you to bring a guest in every time. I come in with my sister usually early mornings weekdays and occasionally on the weekends if we been slacking. If the machines are full we alternate between two others within the same muscle group or do calisthenics. Nice variety of machines. The weights are usually racked or not far off to find and the equipment never looks dirty because members use their towels usually, other than the ropes of course. Nick from the body combat class is an awesome instructor and I have no complaints about the floor in there (why do people even complain about that unless they're eating off of it? It's a gym! Mats are provided!) and everything is sanitized and equipment not down longer than a few weeks for the machines, unsure about treadmills down time. Never used the locker rooms, sauna, or the viewing room. I get in and get out and bring my own music. Bathrooms are fine. I love that they even have a daycare, great for parents working out! I once saw a counter person kicking out a group of young thugs who tried to get in probably with one of the parent's membership cards to play basketball but were all minors. Thank goodness. Overall, I'd pay for a membership. Maybe once I get mine I'll get all nitpicky about stuff but no bad experiences so far, pretty chill, except a very snappy girl at the front the last time who not-so-kindly reminded me to sign in ALL SPACES on the guest sign in sheet and demanded my ID.

I must be honest with you from the onset, you are reading a review of a sushi resteraunt from someone who doesn't eat sushi.....ussually. 

First things first, make a reservation and if you're feeling frisky sit at the tepa bar because there is a different menu then the resteraunt. 

SECOND, ORDER THE APPETIZER RIBS....youre welcome. Dont waste your time on the gyoza, we didnt finish them, they seem to have so much ginger to mask some other flavor that is very unappetizing. 

Third, get yourself the sake' flight. We didnt have reservations and sat at the bar.  The tender, JJ, was amazing.  She reccomeded this flight and knowing nothing about sake' i was happy to accept the reccomendation.  I didnt realize how much i loved sake'! 

It was truly a blessing to have her lead us in our culinary trip.  She spoke so highly of Chef Morimoto, let us know he was a really awesome boss and explained his love for sake' and background which made me want to love eating here. And boy did I. 

From there we had the tempura shrimp rolls (I know not real sushi).  I have been craving these since the day we left! Something about the crunchy shrimp center mixed with the perfect texture of the rice had my taste buds craving more.  I think it was may favorite menu item.  Things were going so well we stepped out of our box and tried the spicy salmon rolls; phenominal.  Not a hint of fishyness or that weird weedy flavor you get with cheap roll.  

We followed up by sharing the bop fried rice which is made tableside in a 400 degree bowl.  The chef arrived at out table and explained the process while cracking the farm fresh egg mixing it with in house milled rice, and  of course the secret soy sauce recipe. We opted for the kobe beef, but it is quite pricey. All waitstaff say the chicken or fish is also very good.  It is quite a dramatic presentation and well worth the attention. 

We ended the meal with the salted carmel chocolate marshmello ball which is lit on fire utilizing 151 alcohol.  As we watched the chocolate ball melt into the marshmello goodness we knew we made the perfect choice to end our meal.  Our meal ended as dramatically as it started.  

The theme here is presentation and Chef Morimoto is nothing short of perfect.  The only thing i didnt like about my meal is that it was over,  and the gyoza, but given the perfection of the rest of our culinary experience i would still say Chef Morimoto hit a home run with this Vegas culinary experience.",2017-01-09 00:08:43

Also, my review lacks the 5th star because my friend and I were seated at this super small corner table that should NOT even exist.  We are like the minorities seated in the small back corner of the restaurant.  It's pretty sad.  I felt kind of offended by that; considering there were many 2 seater tables that were empty nearby.  Seems a bit racist or discrimating to me.  The table was like the size of a college desk where you can barely fit a notbeook and a pencil.  Ridiculous.

We'll see what happens when I come back.  That actually really ticked me off.  They're lucky their food is good.  Stay tuned, I'll be back to try more items and see if I'm treated equally when I come back!

For this visit, I ordered the following:

Corn Dogs = These were of course very good.  You can't really go wrong with corn dogs; especially deep fried ones.  Dish comes w/ only 3 peices.  A little shady.

Sashimi Trio = All pieces tasted good and fresh.  It came w/ 3 slices of Ahi Seared Tuna, Yellow Tail, and Tuna.  The slices are SUPER SMALL; again a littly shady.  But it was good.

Steamed Mussels = Portion was ok and the dish was tasty.

Grill PB&J Sandwiches = simple, but the best dish out of the everything.  Definitely something to eat last because it's kind of like a dessert since it's sweet and comes w/ a tad bit of fruit.  I loved every bite of it.

Another cool thing is that you can pay $24.99 a head for AYCE.  But add an extra $2 to some of the seafood items; not worth it.  If you do AYCE, stay away from any upgrades.

I absolutely love this coffee shop and I wish I lived closer so I could become a regular here. The description says it's 1/2 coffee shop, 1/2 wine bar but it's so much more. To describe it in more detail, once you walk in, you are welcomed by a humble counter with menus and some pastries begging to be eaten. The staff is friendly and they make everything to order. Seat-yourself seating is all around you and ranges from tables for two, to tables for 10 and even couches and ottomans. It would be easy for me to get lost in translation and find myself still there hours later. Now as if all that isn't enough, just wait until you walk outside to the patio. When they say they have live music, they mean seriously live music with a stage, bleachers and plenty of additional seating. I will be coming back soon to experience a live concert because I could tell it would be fun. 

I will call this next paragraph ""Delicious:""

So I've described the excellent vibe but now let me move on to the coffee and food which is just as (if not more) important. Delicious. Absolutely delicious. I enjoyed a white chocolate peppermint latte which was as delectable as it sounds. It was the perfect combination of peppermint and chocolate with non-fat milky foam: truly perfect for a blustery fall day in the desert. For my meal, I ordered the delicious mozzarella sandwich and added turkey. It melted in my mouth and was so huge I was able to take half home with me. However, I will try to erase this tasty sandwich from my memory for I heard that they are replacing it with a new menu item soon. Tear. :( But, the menu is hearty and they even offer delicious breakfast options. 

If I could, I would make this a daily visit and I would bring my computer here and work for an entire day. They have free wi-fi and it just feels like home (or home to a funky friend of yours with eclectic style).

When I got in the cafe is pretty small but the workers were really friendly immediately offering a small sample of their soup of the day which happened to be coconut curry.

 The sample was okay but instead we ended up ordering their top most popular sandwich: the tree of life pita, California turkey, and the Apple kale and banana smoothie. Both the sandwiches comes out freshly made but Flavors cut short, it just didn't impress me. It literally tastes like the exact same roasted bell pepper sandwich I make at home, so to come here without feeling any sense of awe or amazement just fell extremely short of expectations. 

The sandwich is vegan and all you can really taste is sour and bell peppers. The salad dressing they use is a bit on the overly sour, and I couldn't really taste any of the other dressing they put on it sadly. Another note that depressed me a little was the extremely thin to almost nonexistent avocado on the sandwich, I didn't even notice the pita had avocados when I bit into it which is sad because I am a huge avocado lover and it was the main reason I ordered the tree of life pita. I felt robbed of my avocado.


I mean when I see their yelp score I think to myself, there are plenty of places that are better than here and don't have 5 star ratings on yelp. Don't get me wrong, this place isn't disgusting at all, it just doesn't deserve a perfect score though In my opinion. 10$ for is a kinda pricy for a tiny pita or sandwich that I can make at home for almost nothing and pack it with more than just 3 tiny avocado slices that are paper thin.

The food here is just very plain in my opinion, and I'm not at all impressive, location is extremely small and nothing to be amazed at (about the size of my desk). I would of been more happier spending the same amount at skinny fats for their kale smoothies or sandwiches. I really do want to give this place 5 stars but sorry to disappoint, bronze cafe just simply doesn't get the gold.

Tldr: overly priced food, sour plain taste, extremely tiny spot, hard to find, but workers are nice.",2015-01-22 08:37:30

It's always nice to have more places opening up in such a bland area, although I'm certain we probably should have waited a few months before giving them a try.

We both ordered a couple of eggrolls and Thai teas. The eggrolls were decent, while the Thai tea, which took forever because they had to cook the boba, was just okay. I ordered a plate of shaken beef, which included rice and an egg that I could mix at my own will. My girlfriend's plate included noodles, veggies, and both beef and chicken (sans the shrimp). 

My dish, which the server said was one of their more popular choices, was excellent. Beef was well seasoned and great quality. Everything meshed well together. My girlfriend, on the other hand, immediately noticed that the chicken was pink and obviously undercooked. Not good. You get a bit of wiggle room with beef, but definitely not with chicken. It was one of the few instances where we had to point it out to the server. Not to kick up a fuss, but just so they're aware for future consistency purposes.

The server apologized and gave us an extra percentage off of our meal. Apparently, since my dish was prepared first, she took the blame for rushing the cook to hurry and finish hers so that there wouldn't be a long gap between servings - a common problem that I've noted in other reviews of similar places.

Overall, the place does have potential, but I think if we return, we'll let some time lapse in order to allow them to iron out their wrinkles.",2017-10-07 22:15:59

The Croque Madame had the perfect salty bite.  You get a ham and cheese sandwich, toasted and buttered to perfect.  To top it off you get a sunny-side up egg. Calories-Smalories. You cannot skimp on this greatness.  Break into the yolk and ZOMG... sauce to moisten the sandwich and to mix in with the sauce that reminds me of hollandaise.  Comes with a side of fries but you can ask for potatoes or fruit.  The sandwich is somewhat heavy so the size is perfect for a brunch meal.

The Sourdough Waffle was also amazing.  You don't need to extra syrup or butter because the waffle is by itself sweet enough.  It is topped with pecans and apples so it feels like you are eating a pie instead of a waffle.  The sourdough flavor is light but only if you nibble the edges of the waffle that is not topped with the sauce.

Raspberry filled beignets were also a great appetizer.  The waffle was light and pretty crumbly.  The raspberry jam was not overly sweet so the sugar coating makes it a bit that isn't overpowering.

I loved the feel of this restaurant in addition to the service and the coffee.  Yes, the coffee.  I don't know what coffee they brew but it wasn't sour tasting and I kept wanting refills. A must try when you are in Vegas and looking for a superb brunch location.",2016-01-11 01:58:32

The girl at the front said neither thank you, hello, or explained the place to me.  She just stood there, looking around.  

The presentation of the place was super cute - but very something my grandmother would like - knicknacks and all sorts of things to buy with cute phrases and everything that doesn't appeal to my demographic.  However, if you have KIDS and you are looking for a place that is welcoming for that kind of thing - there were tons of kids everywhere.  

I don't see myself going back as I'm a big fan of chains with more of a focus on protein.  This place is legit with their love of bread, (which was pretty good and offered free samples.)

To the owners or management - train your staff. They were not welcoming nor engaging.  You've had plenty of time. I expect better from a Mormon chain.  Look at Z***a's! They're personable and amazing!",2016-08-18 20:08:06

This store is well stocked enough for the art addict.

I will never stop imagining myself with a swirly moustache and a beret, dancing around a canvas and having outbursts of ""et voila!!"" accompanied by sweepingly grandiose arm gestures.

The food is quite tasty. We like spicy and they delivered on that quite well. It is a popular place and you will often see many cabs parked outside, but that's not necessarily because of tourists flocking there. It's mainly because of the high number of Ethiopian cab drivers that Las Vegas has. 

If you have never had Ethiopian food, served traditionally, keep in mind that it is served family style and with Injera used as the only food vessel/utensil. Injera is basically like a sour thin pancake/thick tortilla. We ordered the vegetable combo and meat combo.  It is served on a big plate that is also covered in Injera.

Like I said, the food is tasty and I strongly recommend it if you want to try authentic Ethiopian food. 

Now, the downsides: 

It is most certainly not the cleanest restaurant. Though the floor and tables appeared pretty clean, the walls, and fixtures are all quite dirty and dusty. Also, the bathrooms are borderline gross. The men's bathroom had no towels or toilet paper. 

The service is a bit slow and refills on water come once at best. Very friendly though. 

The restaurant is quite warm and they burn incense which is pretty potent. Also, the clientele is mainly Ethiopian so if you're not Ethiopian, be prepared to be stared at a bit by the clientele as you enter.  

Since you eat with your hands, I would expect a wet towel or something to rinse your hands with when you get there or when you are done, but neither are offered. 

Drinks are not served from a tap or soda fountain so no free refills on anything except ice water. 

Overall, I like the place and since we have been twice, I doubt we'll go back any time soon but I do recommend it if you're in the mood for a nice unique dining experience. Just be sure to wash your hands before you get there.",2015-08-11 12:41:14

All I know is Gyro (I'm guilty of calling it a jai-row, sorry) and Falafel (my first vegetarian meal as a teenager), but that's okay, it's all delicious. My only pet peeve with most Greek places I've tried is that they're way over priced for the quality and quantity of food you get...but I have to say, not the case at The Great Greek. They pile on the fresh meaty deliciousness.

The Great Greek is located right at the forefront of the Sears parking lot on Warm Springs. A fairly small place, but I do appreciate that they have an outside patio seating area (just wish the water fountain worked, it would add to the ambience). The inside is bright, clean, and the staff very friendly and accommodating (my wife loves asking questions about the menu...). Our server was a hoot and very helpful, young bubbly girl with a thick accent.

Next time we come here I'll be more adventurous, but I go with what I know...I ordered the Great Greek Gyro, should be called the gigantic Greek gyro: lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, a heaping pile of shaved meats, topped  with lots of tzaziki and feta cheese wrapped in flat bread. I got the combo, which comes a drink and side order, so for .50 more I got the Feta Fries, totally worth it! Melty cheesy goodness, where have these been all my life! The wife got the Greek rice bowl with steak (sans the Kalamata olives, she doesn't care for them..). A rice pilaf, under a bed of Greek salad and topped with a skewer of juicy grilled steak and tzaziki sauce on the side. She loved it, but couldn't finish it (probably because she kept picking at my Feta Fries ).
We also got some Baklava and those Greek shortbread cookies to take home...the Baklava was terrific, not sickly sweet like most and my wife loved the Greek cookies.

So, now I know where to get awesome Greek food in my neighborhood (can cross that off my list). If you're in the area, near Fast food row (as I like to call it) on Warm Springs behind Sunset Station and craving  a gyro or some other Mediterranean delicacy, definitely stop by and give it a try.

We had a helpful waiter who I forgot his name(maybe Brad?) I don't recall. We came in as a party of 8 but he allowed us to have half the table order their take on chefs recommendation set(or what he thought were the most popular items in the restaurants) and allowed the other half to order entrees of our own. Usually when you get chefs recommendation style, the whole table would be forced to all get it but we were glad that we were able to get a bit of everything to try. 

We ordered the braised black cod, surf and turf, seafood topan yaki and two side orders of duck fried rice. The chef recommendation that our waiter have got for us consisted of sticky ribs, beef capraccio, yellowtail tacos, Rock Shrimp Tempura, a sushi platter that consist of rolls and raw, the ribeye, and two desserts. 

I will start off with the bads. I dont particularly recommend the duck fried rice. It's aite but personally its not really worth to get it at its price. A bit too dried as well. The other thing that was surprisingly not great was their sushi platter. I thought Morimoto would thrive at their sushi and such but it was really mediocre. With that said, the winner of it all goes to their Rock Shrimp Tempura. Their rock shrimp tempura that are in two styles( wasabi aioli and spicy kochujian sauce) with a side of celery(think of eating wings) + blue cheese sauce was pretty horrendous. It was like their take on the chinese style mayo walnut shrimp but worse. This dish just didn't come together for me and the flavors didn't make much sense. It was the memorable dish that I wanted to forget. 

Goods: everything else was pretty damn good. I would say the one that stand out to me the most was actually their ribeye. First of all, I didn't know they offered steaks but it was overwhelmingly delicious. It was actually one of the better steaks I've had that might be able to compete with Craft and that is some high praising cause Craft Steakhouse(which is next door)is the best. Not only was it seasoned well, it was almost melt in your mouth good and you can tell high quality it was. Some other dish that were memorable was the yellowtail/hamachi tacos. It was really refreshing and delicious. The surf and turf, I thought the turf part was forgettable but I forgot the sashimi style yellowtail(almost like a capraccio) was pretty delicious but I prob wouldn't order this again just to eat 50% of the dish. Beef carpraccio, which I thought was pretty delicious, Had a nice sauce and it comes with a fair amount. Another surprise was their sticky ribs. For a japanese restaurant, I wouldn't think of coming here to get their ribs but damn it was fall off the bone good which allowed me to just fork the sticky ribs off and eat it instead of having to dirty myself using my hands. The seafood topan yaki was okay. I thought they were generous with the amount of seafood they had. You can think of almost any kind of seafood and it'll be there consisting from clams-mussels-scallop-crab-lobster. I thought the desserts were fairly nice as well. The donuts were really soft and fluffy. Just the right amount of sugar around it and you can squeeze the amount of custard you want in it. The chocolate dish was a nice show to watch and I thought it was pretty delicious as well.

The chefs recommendation cost $396 for 4 people. Personally given the amount of food they gave us, I thought it was a reasonable price for how good it tasted. I just really recommend that you substitute the rock shrimp tempura for something else. 

I would definitely come back.",2017-01-09 00:31:55

Grabbed a cart, cleaned it with the Purel cloths provided (that's what us germophobes do), and then discovered that the cart wouldn't wheel right.  This is the umpteenth time this has happened at countless Walmarts, and it pisses me off, 'cause it rarely happens at other stores.  That was Strike 1.

Strike 2:  Because I had a return, I had to wait for the greeter to print out a sticker.  A woman was ahead of me returning a bunch of clothing items.  But the little sticker printer wouldn't work.  I waited interminably while she tried to get it to function, then left to get help, and returned with only a pen, so that she could hand write every item on each sticker.  

Strike 3:  Customer Service area.  There were only three people ahead of me, and two registers were open.  But they were helping customers who were buying money orders, and that takes forever.  Three cashiers were bunched up at the two registers, trying to deal with a problem with one of the money order buyer's purchase.  I waited at least 15 minutes to make that return.

Strike 4:  I needed to buy two items, and that's only because the different Walmart I was at a few days earlier was out of them.  What???  Walmart out of an item?  Unheard of!  Trying to find the TP aisle at this Walmart was an exercise in futility.  A lot of exercise - walking around the store, since it wasn't where it usually is at their other stores.  We all know that shopping at W is always a CRAPPY experience, literally and figuratively.  Finally, with both items in my cart, I headed to the registers.

Strike 5:  Like most Walmarts, there were about 40 registers.  And like most Walmarts, almost all were closed.  There were three open in the food half of the store, the long lines populated with overflowing carts.  And in the non-food half, there was ONE DAMN REGISTER OPEN, with at least 15 people in line.  After I waited a few minutes, the woman behind me said to her companion ""I'm going to the self-check.  I decided to follow her to the other end of the store, and found a line stretching nearly halfway across the store.  Ah, I thought, I'll go to Customer Service and pay for my two items there.  On the way, I looked for a front-end manager, but there was no one.  When almost at CS I saw a huge line, and an angry woman there had just snared the front-end manager, who was in transit from somewhere in the store.  The manager said something to her, so I asked the woman what she said.  She reported that the manager told her that she'd been calling for more cashiers for over half an hour, and got nowhere.

That was the last straw.  I flung my cart aside, and left.  I wasted over an hour in that store, for nothing.  Screw Walmart.  I hope Papa Sam is turning over in his grave.",2015-04-22 07:29:36

For those who've been around Las Vegas community theatre, Zenoch is Enoch Augustus Scott who has been in a good amount of theatre most memorable in ""Cannibal! The Musical.""  As the MC of the show, he's very good!  He's funny, he keeps the show moving along, and he has a good voice.

Understand that if you come to Zombie Burlesque, it is goofy, crazy, corny fun.  All of the actors give 100% to make this a good show.  Besides the fine performers, there's a LIVE seven piece band on a raised platform above the stage and they really pump out the music in very fine fashion.

The show moves through different scenes--one in a graveyard, one a take on the Newlywed Game of years past, one with audience participation--a man selected by a female zombie.  It's a funny premise.  After the vodka bottle and the Jell-o box hook up on stage, the audience receives a small plastic cup with a Jell-O shot.  There was one somewhat classic ballet dance that was very well done.

The show runs for about 70 minutes.  It's in Theatre 3 of the V Variety Theatre complex.  The theatre is on the second floor.  With the show starting at 8:30, you're invited to go upstairs before 8 and enjoy something from the bar until the show then playing lets out and they start seating for the Zombie Burlesque Show.

As for photos, I was told by an usher that they weren't allowed.  Just before the show started, a voice announced the rules by saying ""there are no rules.""  I went with the voice over the usher.

Go and enjoy the show.  Don't expect highbrow entertainment.  You'll laugh and you'll groan at some of Zenoch's comments but you'll have fun.",2016-08-10 01:00:25

I came here to meet up with my boyfriend and a group of his colleagues. This place is right near their office and is apparently one of their go-to places for after work drinks. It was very quiet when I arrived, as it was Friday night and this must not be a hot spot for going out. There were about 15  people there from the company, varying in ages of 25-55ish. Everyone was just sitting and drinking when a waitress came over and took my order. After she left one of the guys told me the waitress had been rude and then cut him off from drinking...but then allowed him to get another drink a little while later? This seemed weird to me since he didn't seem drunk at all, and normally when someone is cut off they don't serve them again.

My suspicions were that the staff wanted to close since it wasn't too busy, and this larger group (we were one of the only ones left) was causing them to have to stay so they were annoyed. I didn't see anyone being rude to the wait staff or doing anything out of line, so when someone asked what was going on and why we were being treated rudely, the manager came out. He was very rude, and asked us to leave. I couldn't really hear what he was saying, but he was yelling at the senior manager from the firm and the rest of the group...who were not yelling back. It was the weirdest thing...so we packed up and left and went to Drake 150. 

I do understand that sometimes groups get roudy and drink too much, but having never met these people before and arriving completely sober, I couldn't understand why the bar kicked us out so rudely (you can be professional about it if there actually is a problem). I also understood that my boyfriends company comes there often and spends a lot of money, so that's unfortunate for the restaurant that this won't be happening anymore.

I would not recommend this place for any company events, or after work drinks. I will not be back for sure!",2015-06-04 18:56:07

We were seated in at a table that just shouldn't even be there.  I felt severely cramped.  I couldn't sit any further from the table than I was because of the close proximity of the chair behind me and my husband's seat was literally sticking out into the hallway.  I thought about just giving up at that moment and going elsewhere but it was his birthday dinner someplace supposedly special based on our last visit so he moved the table and his chair back a bit and we decided to stick it out for some great food.

Ummm... not really.

The menu options looked great.  I ordered the butternut squash gnocchi with brussel sprouts (ok, I absolutely love brussel sprouts so any dish with them was going to be my first choice) and he ordered hot sausage rigatoni.  They both came with salads and we were provided hot bread.  Sounds like a winner.

Ummm.. not really.

When served, first off, you'd think that an Italian place (upscale Italian) would offer fresh cheese grated on top.  Not so.... Ok, but I bet it's gonna be scrumptious, way above the chain restaurant that pleases us every time.  Not so...  

I like butternut squash.  Makes a good side dish and I've had it in ravioli and loved it.  Not this time.  The dish was ugly to the eye.  It was all brown, gravy brown.  Ok, but it'll be great (you get the drift -- always hoping).  The butternut squash's sweetness was overpowering.  They must have added ingredients on the sweet side because it was wayyyy overpowering.  I would never had known there were brussel sprouts buried in the brown gravy-like substance except it was on the menu and I was looking forward to it.  Well, no taste or texture of it to be found.  

The main issue I have that reduced this review to 2 stars was my entire meal.  How can you have every single part of my meal be sweet?  From the butter on the bread (good, but sweet something added), to my salad with a sweet vinaigrette, to my whole main hugely portioned plate of sickly sweet entrée, to the free dessert of lemon cello shot with a side cookie.  Seriously?  Had the chef gone mad?  Don't get me wrong.  I have a sweet tooth, just not in every single bite/drink I took.  That is what gets you the 2 stars.

And the rigatoni?  Not bad, just not spectacular.

The main reason I'm writing this review is because I needed ridiculous alterations...and when I mean, ridiculous, I mean, REE-DIC-U-LUS!!! I had a dress for work that was a small but, on me, was a XXL. Lets face it, I am a petite woman...it's a blessing and a curse!

The lady that did alterations wasn't there when I initially went but, the owners wife, Ellen (I believe) was such a sweetheart and arranged an appt for me with the alterations lady. Ellen was so sweet and funny and real.....let's face it, being those things goes a long ways in the retail/service/just all around good person field.

When I went in for my appt with the alterations lady, she was funny and sweet, as well. It made all the pricking and prodding with needles a little easier and funny to handle.

The price was extremely affordable, too. $40 for what seemed like a brand new dress.

She told be the dress would be done on a Friday, which was 3 days..I was EXTREMELY shocked! She had so many dresses to finish up and she guaranteed it in 3 days.

In the 4th day, I went to get my dress and it wasn't even touched. Let's just say it was too good to be true but, Ellen and the alterations lady were tooo sweet so, it was forgivable. (AND, THANKFULLY, I didn't need it immediately). 

My friend picked it up for me on the 6th day and it was done. *thankfully*
It wasn't exactly what I had hoped for in that it was still a little too big on my upper body BUT, it was an 80% improvement from the original.

And again the people there made up for the not-so-guaranteed 3 days...

The service was excellent from the hostess to our server at the table. Our water glass were never empty and we didn't even have to ask for someone to come to fill it.

I started off with the ""Guilt & Honey"" bourbon recommended by the server as it is sweet and covers the bourbon taste yet it is still alcoholic. It was good, loved it, I like a cocktail that is on a sweet side. They brought out a complementary salad for us - cucumber, carrot salad to start off.

For the main, I was in between dishes but I decided to get the Roasted Australian Lamb Saddle - with pea puree, potatoes and mint sauce. The plate looks like an artwork when it came to the table, so beautiful that you don't want to mess it up. But I had to eat and it tastes as pretty as it looks. The lamb was tender (I got it medium) and it did not have the ""gamey"" taste at all. The spice rub on top, I think it is pistachio was very good with the mint sauce. I pretty much clean the entire plate clean. We didn't have room for dessert, maybe next time.

Food:
The food is killer gastropub fare: particularly the chicken wings confit (fried in duck fat for a fall-from-the-bone savory quality you can't find anywhere else in town), the pomme frites (or animal frites, laden with luscious, tasty gravy and perfectly cooked sunnyside up eggs), and the Pig's Head (or half a head to be precise-- with everything there save for the brain ((indeed the teeth still cling to the forlorn jaw!)), an extreme culinary delight with rich cheek fat and even richer meat underneath. It is certainly worth the hype and the market price tag. 

(N.B. I'd recommend sitting at the bar so you can enjoy the famed Pickleback drink special: 1 shot of rye whiskey, 1 Black Label beer, 1 shot of pickle juice for a mere $5. It is by far the best drink special on E. 4th Street.) 

Atmosphere: 
The decor is fantastic. A surprising, but in no way off-putting amalgam of rustic and post-modern. The walls are rich, dark wood. A dozen antique bicycles hang from the ceiling and a fabulous array of unique art adorns the walls (on a kind of rotation, all from local artists). There is also a little TV above the bar upon which an impressive collection of VHS movies are constantly playing. GHT staff seem to prefer 80's screwball comedies or sci fi/mystery stuff (Star Wars, X-Files, et al.) but if you sit at the bar, you might be able to make a request from the myriad tapes near the entryway. 

Staff:
The staff are friendly and attentive. Even when the place is slammed (as is often the case during happy hour), one never feels alienated or overlooked.

In sum, this place is a winner. Check it out for Happy Hour or for a romantic dinner. The rooftop bar is the place to be in high summer for a bird's eye view of E 4th's relentless hustle and bustle.",2014-11-04 18:57:32

I can get some great martinis for half price while having a cheap nosh too. The jazz music is always wonderful to relax out to (bit louder inside than out on the patio).

My one small complaint is the uniforms for the women are just awful! Being an upscale steakhouse one should not have women or any shape or size wearing short mini skirts with whatever black hose/fishnets/leggings/etc that they want. It makes this place go a bit down in class for me .

Had din din here one or two times...not bad, but not the best either. Would choose quite a few other steakhouses to have an elegant din.

Try this on for size, McDowell Mountain.
You can access it either from the Windgate or Bell Pass trails, then, once at the pass, it's pretty much vertical. (No formal trail)
Not vertical as in ropes, but more like a 75 degree ascent. Completely do-able with sticks, boots and strong legs.

The trek from Gateway Center to Windgate Pass is around four to five miles on a nicely graded path. Once at the pass, you'll need to free-climb the rest of the way.
Your reward?
A 360 view of the valley, spanning from Mesa all the way to the Bradshaw and Mazatzal mountain ranges. Simply spectacular.
I recommend starting pre-dawn, especially with the hot weather approaching.

If you do attempt this hike, wear good boots, long pants, and leather gloves since some of the ascent is on all fours.
Also bring a ton of water. 
I went through six-sixteen ounce bottles and ran out a couple miles before returning to The Gateway.


Here's another tip. If you're by yourself, wear a bike helmet in case you go down. Also bring a cell phone and an old cd with you in case you fuck-up and break a leg or twist an ankle or something.
You can call for help and use the cd to flash signal the air ambulance.

Note:
There's no trail to the top of McDowell Mountain from Windgate Pass, but you can follow an old barbed wire fence laying on the ground for a ways, starting just up from the pass.
When you're finished with this achievement, head for Temple Bar, just down the street on Thompson Peak & Bell Roads where in a fitting salute the mountain's namesake, General Irvin McDowell, you'll slog down a couple beers and as many shots in his honor.

General Irvin McDowell. 
Famed Indian figher, West Point grad, and chronic alcoholic in his later years.

We were in the first room and there were only 3 seats. They brought in another chair so we didn't have to split up. We were given hot tea and a plate which had some crackers and candy.

We all decided on getting a 1 hour session. My masseuse was Jessica. She was on point. She figured out where all my knots were! Towards the end of the massage, she even stepped on my back to take care of the areas which needed extra work!! When the hour was over, I think we all wanted more...

The only complaint I have about this place is when they turned on their red neon window light half way through hour session. It caused the dim room to have a red glow and a annoying buzzing sound. The massage was feeling so good, that I was able to block out that annoying buzzing sound.

We got 10% off for mentioning Yelp when we made our appointment, which brought it from $38 to $35 for the 1 hour session. We all got a stamp card which gets you 1 free massage after 10 paid sessions.",2010-09-16 07:54:38

1) They need to find a better source for their salmon. It's flavourless but very fresh. 
2) They need to look at their pricing. Some dishes are severely over priced and others have wayy to much bang for your buck. At the end, you pay a pretty hefty bill which doesn't fully translate into the experience. 20% less would be more appropriate.

Venue Description.

There is a lovely patio area where my friend's wedding took place. I was torn between watching the actual wedding, and looking out on the water as the sun was setting (seagulls flying, water lapping over the rocks, romantic setting etc...) The patio area is divided into two levels: the main level for ceremonies and cocktails, and a small, narrower, upper level for tables, and in our friend's wedding, a photo booth for pictures, and a set up area where guests received their table information.

Once inside, I noticed some tables spilled onto the dance floor. I am sure there is a maximum the venue can accept but I believe our friends' wedding count was 200-ish. Food was EXCELLENT! One of the better I have tasted. Appetizer was a soup (lobster bisque) and salad (arugula) combination. Main course was either fish or steak option. I had the steak and it was very, very, VERY good. The kitchen had cooked it medium to medium rare which meant, no dry steak here. Dessert was left outside and you could get cake, tea, coffee, etc... (buffet style).

Our friend had an open bar, but staff were very good in ensuring glasses were always filled with wine and water. Our table had the head waiter and she was excellent. No complaints there.

All in all, this was a great place to host a summer wedding. The only issue I had were with some of the staff during the cocktail event part of the wedding. Some staff seemed very miserable and in fact grumpy. In such happy times as a wedding, the last thing I want to see is a hater-of-the-world. But only a select few. Most of the wait staff at Palais Royale were great.",2012-08-28 15:48:30

I hated that Apple products just looked cooler, felt solid and cost so dang much.  And I refused to drink the Kool-Aid.

Fast forward to 2013 and a new job, where Macs are on every desk.  Being surrounded by aluminum and a ridiculous number of pixels, I thought it was time to maybe sample the Kool-Aid.  I was introduced to the Apple business team and they went out of their way to make sure I got a good swig of what they were selling.

I put them through the paces in the store and on the phone...numerous times.  The average conversation lasted 45 minutes.  Yet no matter how stupid my questions or concerns were, they never got pushy, never seemed irritated and always showed me respect.  So I made the leap and ordered a custom build MacBook Pro.  

After waiting 2 weeks for it to be built in China and shipped to the US, I gingerly extracted my new baby, powered it up and...the trackpad didn't work.  WTF?!?  I tried everything I could to get it to work and after 2 hours of frustration and anger, stormed to the Apple store to shove it up their...and you know what they did?  They took it back, ordered a new one and gave me a ""loaner.""  Wow.  Last time my PC was DOA, I had to fight Best Buy for a new one.  Not here; every single employee who heard my plight came up and apologized for the inconvenience.  

While waiting for delivery of my actual MacBook, I was told Apple had just lowered their prices and now had the exact spec'd MacBook I wanted in store (no more custom build).  They said I could just walk in, return the loaner, pick up a brand spanking new MacBook, and they would credit me the difference.  

The service and assistance I get at this Apple store is far and away better than any other electronics store I've been in; including the Microsoft and Sony (when it was open) stores.

I went on a weekday around lunch when it was only about half full, thankfully. The decor is super cute - a bit retro. The tables are bit and spaced openly - I love that they're not cramming tables into their small space.

First of all, with their awesome sounding menu and elevated food concept, I would've expected their coffee to be excellent. It was dilute and a bit burnt and tasted as crappy as (if not a little worse than) 24-hour diner coffee. Tsk.

Second, the service was really crappy. I don't know if they were understaffed or what, but the waitress was in a rush to take our orders but rarely refilled our waters and coffees. And food took forever to come out... what's up with that?

Third, the food. It was a bit of a letdown. The pesto/sun dried tomato/salami omelet is one of my favorite combinations at my favorite brunch spot in Chicago. This version was alright... but something was missing, and the flavors just didn't seem balanced. The omelet seemed like it was supposed to be fluffy, but it wasn't that great. My friend's smoked salmon omelet was collapsed (not to mention underwhelming in smoked salmon flavor and presence). I didn't try the challah french toast - no complaints or raves from the person who ordered it though.

I'm still willing to give this place another chance. And by no means was the food bad - just not super awesome. But the reviews here and the menu itself sounded AWESOME. The actual food didn't quite live up to the expectations. 

Maybe it's a fluke? Maybe since brunch food is a pretty competitive and saturated niche in Chicago, my standards are set pretty high? Maybe they are just staffed better in the front and back on the weekends? Who knows. I'll see next time.",2014-01-07 00:48:45

The downside? The food. My steak was cooked unevenly, where half the steak was medium rare and the other half was overcooked. The sides were bland and unmemorable. The best dish was the scallop entree that my guest ordered that night. 

The Mortons name screams excellence. Unfortunately, the food I was served screamed mediocre. I give two stars for the decor and service, otherwise I would have given one for the meal.",2013-05-15 13:21:46

We were greeted by the owners daughter, and served by her husband and brother. Bread rolls and water were brought while we looked at the menu. They also have several wines from Italy and Sicily by the glass which is nice. 

We started with the pasta e fagioli soup which was delicious. A large bowl filled with cannellini beans, pasta and chunks of pancetta. A 5 star soup! 

For our entrees we ordered the eggplant parmesan and the gnocchi with pesto and gorgonzola which is made in house. The waiter asked if we wanted a salad and I asked if they had a SMALL side salad. He said yes. A few minutes later a HUGE salad was brought out that could have easily fed 4 people. It was loaded with roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, buffalo mozzarella, olives, tomato and red onion. Although it was very good, I was a little upset I was brought a $9 dinner salad when I asked for a small side salad. A misunderstanding? I hope so. 

The entrees came out and both were very large portions. You definitely get your moneys worth here, as well as leftovers for lunch the next day :)  The eggplant parm was big and covered in cheese. Served with a  side of spaghetti there was plenty to take home. The gnocchi were also very good, melted in my mouth. The sauce was very heavy and very rich, I could barely finish half of it.

Its not on the strip swarmed by tourist, but its not a divey local's casino like many of the Station properties. It's filled with luxury amenities like many other tier one casinos, ie lush rooms, spa, pool, and one good restaurant.

Anthony's is easily the best restaurant at the M because besides having quality food, it has prompt and attentive service, spacious and scenic dining spaces, and modern decor. The menu is very classic American steakhouse and doesn't have any ""fuzion"" offerings like other places pretending to be something they're not. The meats come from the owner of the M resort's family farm (Marnell Family Double Fork Ranch) which sounds like a great way to cut cost from suppliers and offer steaks at more affordable pricing (without the extra strip steakhouse fee) . Most entrees range from $40s-$50s and do not come with sides ($9).

My favorite is the dry aged bone in rib eye and has came medium rare each time and secondly would be the sea bass that comes with a nice hard sear. Crab legs are still in shell, but cut for your ease of access, taste is pretty plain jane accommodated with butter. Salads come in a generous portion and no withering salad leafs in sight. I can't say any praise for the side asparagus though as it was limped and wet. As for adult libations there is an extensive wine menu, but I choose to partake in the $10 blue label special instead because... blue label.

Reservations are probably not needed unless you're bringing your company here for a large  dinner on the outside balcony with a view of the entire Las Vegas strip because the M offered you an unbelievably cheap price to room all your employees in their classic suites.",2015-10-01 19:35:35

Their make their udon fresh from scratch and you can watch their action from the glass while you order your food. 

First, you waited in line to pick your udon/ rice bowl. They have over twenty udon variety from kake, bukake, carbonara, clam, tomato based, etc. They also have rice curry bowls as side order or main dish (BIG bowl). 

Second, you pick your sides: shrimp tempura, fish cakes and vegetable tempuras, spam musubi (yes they have it too), salmon or spicy tuna wrap, etc.

Last, you pick your drinks. Their lemonade is fresh squeezed and it's pretty good. They also have bottomless specialty brewed tea by Harney and Sons, peach, tropical green, etc. If you like sweet, they have syrups with many different flavors to add to your tea.  I tried their tropical green and it's very refreshing! If you check-in on Yelp, drink is on the house. 

I tried their Kitsune Udon with side of shrimp and vegetables tempura. I liked it, udon was perfect, chewy and not soggy. My kake udon soup was also delicious. I also tried their Carbonara and Yaki udon and they were delightful. The bowl for Carbonara or Yaki udon were HUGE, bigger than my head.

Located on the 31st floor of the Trump Hotel, this Oliver and Bonacini owned restaurant gives up a very city vibe. The high ceiling and purple lighting gives the place a very trendy and classy atmosphere great for after work drinks or even big parties. 

As my friend and I arrived at America, we were greeted by the hostess and asked if we wanted our coats to be checked. Declining the offer, we were quickly brought to our seats and were given menus. Our waitress quickly showed up afterwards and asked what we wanted to drink and outlined the menu items. As the waitress was talking to us, a bread basket and some spread as given to us promptly.

After deciding what to order, I got a 2014 Rockbare Shiraz to drink while my friend got a Winterlicious mocktail. For the entrees, I had the roasted hillside garden beet salad (with buffalo ricotta, pumpkin seed brittle, and lemon preserve) while my friend had the heritage smoked salmon ""pastrami"". Although the beet salad was fresh,  I have to say I enjoyed the smoked salmon ""pastrami"" more out of the two. In terms of the main course, we had both ordered the Wellington county beef tenderloin (with bourbon molasses glazed short rib, sweet potato, okra, and red-eye gravy). The steak was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and the short rib just fell apart as soon as you cut into it. The dish again was presented beautifully and I personally enjoyed the steak the most that night. The shiraz I ordered paired well with the steak. Lastly, we both ordered the vegan PB&J trifle (with concord grape jelly, kernal peanut mousse, and coconut pound cake). An interesting dessert based off of a classic sandwich combination. The peanut butter mousse was a bit sweet for my taste but the sweetness was balanced by the juiciness of the grapes. Overall, good ending to the meal.

In terms of the service, we did not feel rushed at all and the pace of the meal was smooth. The timing from main course to dessert course was a bit longer but it didn't bother the both of us as we were catching up. Service was friendly and attentive and it is what you would expect from a more higher priced restaurant. 

Would have loved to go out onto the balcony/patio area to get a view of the city but it was closed for the winter (which is understandable). Overall, good Winterlicious experience!",2017-02-03 21:08:14

The place wasn't busy, but the service was friendly  and efficient, and the food totally decent, cheap, and abundant. Where else in King West area can you get a full breakfast for $5.99? 

The cherry was when this rather old, and hunched-over gentleman with a cane came in for his weekend breakfast. His name is Mort and he is clearly a regular. 

As Mort took his seat he apologized for sitting at the table in front of me with his back to me as he would have preferred to face me so we could have a conversation. (Does it get anymore classic and charming than this? Not really).

He dropped his cane and I asked if I could help him and he said: no, I'm able with cane.

After a brief pause, we both burst out laughing. Cuz Abel and Cain.. lol!

He was impressed that I got the reference and was like: College educated? Me too. I have good feeling about you. I know people and I have a good feeling about you. Then he fist bumped me.

Then he asked if I was an opera fan. I said, no. He replied: so are you a Sally Rand fan? 

His friend asked if I knew who that was. I said no. Then Mort goes:  if you don't like opera u must like Sally Rand. She was as a nudie dancer. In the 30s if you asked someone if they liked Sally Rand it was, what do you call it? A JOKE!

He told me that to save money, Tsing Tao assumed that all houses had their own utensils!! What the fuck!!!? Chopsticks and napkins cost almost nothing you cheap bastard. I have never had my Chinese orders come without these simple things.

We ate our food with fucking steak knives until my chick came home from work (I asked her to grab some plastic forks on the way)

The food was downright terrible. No flavor.. All the meats were overcooked. MSG city.. Egg Rolls were raw inside. All 3 of us agreed that Tsing Tao was some of the worst Chinese we had ever experienced. I dunno if it was because I had just eaten really good Chinese the day before (Desert Jade) or what.. but fucking yuk! I will never give these cheap bastards my business again. All you fuckers on here need to explore a little bit more, because nothing that I tasted was worth 2 stars. For realz mane.. try Desert Jade, then go back and tell me Tsing Tao is worth more than 2 stars-

The show was sold out but most of us were still able to find a place to sit down. 

The hubby and I originally selected a bottle of Malbec - which I had ordered previously and enjoyed during the Yelp event - but it was so, so strong that we were concerned that it had gone bad. He took the bottle back up to the bartender, who tried a sample and thought it tasted normal. However, the bartender was completely fine with our complaint and gave us the Cabernet Sauvignon instead.

When I went back to the counter I went over my order, slowly, thinking it would be right.  Since everyone had already eaten I took it to go without checking it, another mistake on my part.  They left off the mushrooms this time but forgot the bacon.  You think they would have given my burger special attention since they screwed it up the first time, nope.

I'm on a mission to evaluate the various Chinese delivery joints in my area, and this is the latest in my scope. I might actually bump this spot up to 5* once I finish my mission, but until then I'm still figuring out my evaluation system.

Ordered my usual:  one eggroll, Singapire mei-fun, walnut shrimp, Kung-pao chicken, and Mongolian beef. The eggroll was very nice- oily enough to feel decadent, but not to oily as to feel gross. Plus, they threw in two extra, which was nice. I'd requested spicy mustard with my eggroll, and they threw in three packets which was really nice. I also purchased a ""side"" of spicy mustard and they gave me a small container of ""That Good Stuff""- ie the stuff that makes the back of your throat tingle like a Christmas tree getting burned on February 2nd. It was great! The Kung-pao chicken was fine- it was pretty much what you'd expect from a joint like this- tender sliced breastmeat with babycorn, water chestnut, carrot and celery. No real spice to it, but that's pretty much to be expected, since white people have tender bootyholes and tend to complain a lot when something makes them tingle. The Mongolian beef was fine- definitely not my favorite, but not the worst I've ever had. There were no crispy seifun noodles, and there really wasn't any spice, but the flavor of the beef was fine... just fine. The walnut shrimp was tasty and I really appreciated that they served the sauce in a separate container so that the nice fried shrimp and walnuts didn't get gooey in transit. The Singapore mei-fun was actually delightful- just the right amount of spice and ingredients mixed together to give that delightful noodley mouth-feel while delivering bite after bit of meaty goodness. I think that, so far, this has been my favorite Singapore mei-fun.

All in all, this was a solid offering, and it definitely in the running for my ""go-to Chinese delivery"" joint. I love that they threw in a few free eggrolls, and overall I'm extremely pleased with the quality of the food!",2018-07-01 02:28:07

Despite being an organic and earth-friendly salon (and being in one of the swankier sections of Scottsdale), their prices even best many other salons in the EV and Phoenix. At the quality of service I've received from Shelby and seen other guests receive from their stylists, it's a bargain. It also smells great in here--no singed hair or chemical smells.

That doesn't mean it's great - but it's a good number of stars better than it's opposite across the street.  

You're looking at twelve dollars for a burger here - and that comes with a side.  The sauces are delicious and the waitstaff are very informative.  They'll spend a good white talking you through what burger is best for you.

My wife, parents, and grandma all headed out - and on a very busy night we only had to wait twenty minutes for our table for five to be ready.  I also like that they don't do reservations - so when you see people leave, you know that table will be for you.  Everyone is on an equal footing here.

My grandmother had the basic burger - and when she asked if she could ask pickles, and tomatoes, she was told that they were free items.  And they were - all the, ""basic burger toppings,"" are free.  Another review claims that they were charged for these items - and I do not doubt that.  What I suspect is that either, A.) there was an employee who punched it in wrong, or B.) they have changed their policy.  I made sure to ask about the 'free-ness' of basic toppings.

My mother loved the Peanut butter burger (and having had one at another place, I was skeptical) but this one delivered.

Out of the five burgers we tried - the real winner was the one with avocado and jalapenos.   I'm not sure of the name.

Some people might find $13.00 for a burger steep, but compared to the other burger places in the city, it's on par.  And, you can ask to have your meat coked however you want.  You will also get your meat cooked the way you asked, which is a big surprise.  Medium rare does not end up medium.

It's a good treat - it's a nice place to sit down.  And the deep fried pickles?  They're the best I've found in this city.  Don't get me wrong - they're not super... but they're what you're looking for when you want a fix.",2013-03-02 20:38:44

Two hours later, I was driving home and hunger pangs hit. Where to go? I had originally wanted to got to the teriyaki place across from Michael-Angelo's. I went in there and the cook apologized profusely. He was having technical issues with his screen, meaning that the cash register and all debit/credit payments were locked down. 

So, I decided to try the marketplace. I have shopped here once before and loved the Portuguese egg tarts back then. They were fresh and yummy. 

I went for the hot (temperature-wise) foods. The variety is wonderful! I am recovering from a sore throat and hacking, mucus-laden cough. As a result, black pepper makes my throat worse. I could eat the fried rice, macaroni and cheese, stir-fried veggies, mushroom and peas, and coconut Thai pork. I was thrilled!

Prices can be rather steep when you are paying for your food by the gram. My plate of food was $9.61. Despite the price, the food was flavourful. I sat in the seating area and enjoyed my meal. There's free wifi, too. 

After I was done, I needed to visit the women's washroom. It was clean and modern. The blue light means that you can enter and exit the restroom. Red means no -- that it's occupied. 

I got a six-pack of Portuguese egg tarts. They were in a fast clearance price. Yay! I also got a bag of avocados, as I need more good cholesterol in my diet.

Despite some positive press review, I found Metro to be terribly disappointing this time around and lacking substance or lacking for a better word.

Service started off great and then went aloof from there as if we did not exist. The breakfast was nothing reminiscent of a French bistro or brasserie whatsoever. What happened to the wonderful croissants and pains au chocolat ? Borrowing from another review, service was indeed ridiculously slow and indifferent.

I really wanted to see you succeed Metro, but I kinda lost faith. I hope you put a little bit more work in the service delivery and decoration of your awfully cold and depressing dining room.",2010-12-21 14:19:46

Those are my general thoughts on this place. It felt super chill and retro but it also felt really sketchy. Everyone there looked sad, workers and customers. It was comfortable to sit and eat but on a nice sunny day it gets super dark inside, too gloomy. 
I understand the vibe this place is going for but other places do it and better. 

The waitress took our order with a ""I don't care about anything"" attitude. She didn't offer us any drinks so I had to ask a second waitress for glasses of water.

Everything was served quickly but not in a good way, it was just tossed on our table and then the waitress would run somewhere else before we could ask for more water or napkins. 

I'm not usually picky with service but at the least don't serve me like you can't wait for me to leave. I like to sit down and chat with whoever I'm with. Feeling rushed and unwanted is a big turn off.

It just seems like everyone is in less of a rush and much more cognizant about what they put in their bodies.

Fist off the PBRs hit the spot, at that price I'm sure they're dispensing enough of it to maintain it at the peak of freshness.  We also had a few Moretti's for $1.50, another bargain but I don't think that's a daily deal.

We shared a little house/side salad.  For $5 I'm not sure I got a lot of value out of that.  Just a clump of greens on a plate.

We then split a 12""  BBQ Chicken Pizza for $15.95.  That's probably the most I have ever paid for a pizza that size.  It was good but it certainly hasn't had me dreaming about it ever since.  I'd be just as happy with a frozen California Pizza Kitchen pie for $5.  Actually I'd be happier because then I'd have enough money for 22 more PBRs.

Normally we would order a large pizza so we'd have something to take home, but only some pizzas are available in the large size.  This would lead one to believe that the pizzas are made ahead of time.  Who knows, but I think it's sort of a dumb way to set up the menu. 

What really caught my eye though was a parmesan chicken sandwich that I saw sitting on the counter, wow, that thing looked tasty!

Atmosphere?  Not much going happening on a Sunday afternoon.  A few trust fund babies at the bar sort of made me hope that's not the normal crowd.

Open for just over two weeks now,  Tacos El Buen Pastor has finally opened their restaurant location right across Cardenas on Meadows and Decatur! 

Not only can you feast on the best al pastor tacos in town IMO,  but they have expanded their menu to also include other specialties from Jalisco,  Mexico like Tortas Ahogadas and for those of you who remember Birrieria Jalisco back in the day (where Cornish Pasty now stands) Their Birria de Chivo ( Goat ) Estillo Jalisco is very hearty, delicious and generous in portion size (two sizes, $9 and $15) and comes with freshly made corn tortillas. Perfect for this cold weather!  I've never had a Torta Ahogada before ($6.50) so we got one done classically with Carnitas
(However,  you may choose among their other meat selections, and the bread is said to also come from Mexico) this was also pretty huge, hearty, and good.

One of the great things about TEBP is their ordering system: you walk in and peruse the menu...When you know what you want, place your order with the person behind the counter,  pay,  and go find a seat. The cooks call your name when your order is up, and your food is nice and hot. No having to go to a certain line for a certain item, and when you're finally done paying,  your food is cold like those other places **cough El Gordo, Taco Y Taco cough** 

Very comfy seating and spacious inside, with fresh agua frescas that change every so often (there was Horchata and Guayaba) and a full salsa bar to customize your order as you wish. Come check them out!  ALOHA!!!

I have to say that this review is for Kim Mason, who works in the salon, but you do your appointments through her, not the salon.  Her specialty is all-natural pedicures/manicures.. meaning no nasty tub soaks that could be hiding potential funguses, no chemicals soaked up in to your feet... she uses simple ingredients and she tells you what they are (almond oil, alcohol, etc).  Her other specialty is diabetics ... I'm not a diabetic, but from what I understand, diabetic feet are very sensitive and highly prone to cuts, etc.  She is trained in handling that with extra precautions and healthier alternatives to standard salon chemicals.

I've been to see Kim for my feet and also took my mother.. my poor mom's feet of 70something years had never looked better.. seriously.  Kim worked a miracle.  I highly recommend her if your'e looking for natural pedicure/manicure and a health-centered experience - she knows her stuff and is very happy to educate you on cleanliness and safe/proper procedures for foot/hand care.

I got a pedicure from an older lady at this salon. I should state that I mentioned each of these issues to the lady as she worked on my feet .  I guess I thought she might chill out a bit as she went along... nope. While pushing my cuticles back I was stabbed a few times,  as she trimmed my nails my toe was cut, while using sugar scrub I'm pretty sure at least two layers of skin came off, I'm almost positive I'll have a bruise or two along the sides of my leg from the ""massage"" but I think they'll pair nicely with the burnt parts of my legs from the hot towel and hot stone massage.... I did mention the heat more than once and literally had to remove the towels from my legs TWICE because they were too hot.

I have to say, they serve some of the best margaritas I've ever had in the country.  They're unique flavors that you will not find at your local Chevys, Appplebees, TGI Fridays, Taco Bell, or even authentic mexican restaurants.  I highly recommend the hibiscus and pa'bango margaritas along with a third to complete your margarita sampler.  The appetizers are off the hook, especially the queso fundido.  I enjoyed the taco I got put also enjoyed some of the entrees I've had there.  As far as dessert goes, their flan is unbelievable; this is coming from a guy that typically detests the texture and taste of most flan.

I am not a fan of ""sweet meats"" aka a meat with any kind of sweet glaze on it. When I went for Sunday brunch the offerings were sausage, flank, and ham. The grilled pineapple--sweet enough already--also had a sweet cinnamon glaze on it. 

The only redeeming quality were the fresh salad bar and fruits. They also had Wisconsin cheese offerings, nuts, and pastries. Sadly the pastries seemed to have come out of a box from Costco. There was also a buffet of scrambled eggs, bacon, and potatoes. I was really unimpressed by this place but I enjoyed getting my fill of cheap pastries, salad, and potatoes.

Decor was nice. I tried booking a reservation through Open Table but the restaurant wasn't available through the website. Odd.

This is another gimmicky Markham dessert stop. It's a cute one-time experience, but it's really rough around the edges, from the service to the interior layout to the cleanliness. 

There really isn't any flavour to write home about. The ice cream was average at best. The syringe, frankly, has nothing to do with anything and is essentially a gift to the landfill. Even in the sense of a gimmick and the liquid nitrogen shtick, it has no place. 

I think most concerning was the way they pour the liquid nitrogen kind of haphazardly on the ice cream on the counter where people are often waiting for their orders. It's flying and falling off the counter, right onto people standing there. It just made me uncomfortable, particularly when there were kids nearby. 

Do it once if you're curious, but you'll realize soon enough that it's a one-time gimmick. Unlike Woofles & Cream, which was also once the newest dessert craze in Markham, Cool N2 doesn't actually have a good product. They have a mediocre experience and a mediocre product.",2017-06-02 02:30:00

ATMOSPHERE: This places is standard. Fast, lively, reliable. Almost always packed here and noise level may be loud. They have 2 floors, and so can accommodate large parties. I prefer to sit upstairs. It's more quiet and you can actually enjoy a conversation with your party.

Reservations recommended. But a long line going out the door is a regular occurrence here.

SERVICE: Speedy service as they try to keep the crowd moving through the door. They're pretty well staff and respond quickly to requests. But as mentioned, there's usually a bit of waiting for a table.

PRICE: Great deal - good for students or people looking for affordable Japanese cuisine. May have some of the best Japanese lunch specials in town.

FOOD: Not the best in town (own and operated by Chinese, not Japanese) but with their prices, you really can't complain. Never had any issue with food quality and they've been pretty consistent on every visit.

Haru is a sushi place nestled in Mackenzie Towne. It's pretty inside, very IKEA-esque, with pleasant wait staff and food that comes out at lightning speeds.

I ordered the spinach gomae and got a ball of spinach smothered in their sesame dressing. It was like someone had started to pour the dressing on and took a phonecall mid-pour, then realized they had to serve it, saw there was no spinach left, and decided, eff-it; here you go! While the dressing was tasty, it was the equivalent of eating soggy spinach in cold gravy. 

The veggie tempura was delicious. I appreciated that it wasn't one giant slice of sweet potato, a bunch of undercooked onions and mushrooms, and a piece of broccoli that's too big to eat elegantly. That's usually the assorted veggie tempura I've come to expect from most sushi places in town. Haru's assorted veggie tempura had pumpkin, asparagus, mushrooms and sweet potatoes, and it was crispy and not greasy in the least.

Their veggie tempura and avocado rolls were my favorite of everything that I had ordered. There was a decent rice to filling ratio, and the avocado was appropriately buttery. My friend ordered their takoyaki, tuna and salmon sashimi. He said that it was decent, but not the best; out of the three, the takoyaki was the the best. 

The waitress was also unaware if they carried unfiltered sake or not, but I did appreciate that she brought out the warm (read: molten lava-esque) sake wrapped in a little napkin kimono to protect his fingers. My teacup was not wrapped and was nuclear to the touch, but I liked the slightly smoky flavor of their green tea. 

All in all, this is a decent mid-range sushi restaurant in the middle of suburbia. A place for soccer moms to escape, and treat their preschoolers to something that isn't baby carrots and kraft dinner. I know, because they were there.",2012-11-16 18:03:21

I rolled up on a Friday afternoon for a couple sandwiches before they close for the season.  The smell is amazing.  The menu here is modest, which is good.  I don't need to many options when it comes to BBQ.  I decided on the pulled pork and chicken as well as a side of cole slaw.  The gentleman filling my order asked me if I'd like the meat packaged separately instead of him assembling the sandwiches since this was a to-go order.  I thanked him for his wonderful idea.  My order was filled quickly and I was on my way, drooling from the enticing aroma.  

I'll get the bad news out of the way first.  The cole slaw was dry and did not seem fresh.  I'm guessing they make a batch for the whole week on Wednesday and by Friday it's not so good.  But I can forgive the dry cole slaw only because the pulled pork was a thing of beauty.  When I opened the container, I was overjoyed to see the seasoned and burnt ends carelessly mingling with the pink colored smoke ring and some other bits and pieces.  Often pulled pork does not include the ends so it looks pretty and more presentable.  I prefer this messy hodge podge that contains all the flavor.  The sauce was good, but honesty, I didn't even think that the pulled pork needed it.  The pulled chicken was presented much the same way but I did add some sauce to it.  Should I talk about the portions?  I had enough for 3 sandwiches from each container.  Had it been assembled for eating there I'm not sure I would have received as much...or my sandwich would have been overflowing with meaty goodness.  

I should thank Darren W for his info but also update it.  Yes, Pittsburgh Barbecue Company is on Banksville Avenue.  The Days Inn is a good landmark to watch for as PBC is just behind it.  If you are on Banksville Road heading into town, the left turn for Banksville Avenue is just before the Days Inn (and if you pay attention you will see a small sign that directs you to BBQ).  There is no median to block the way now and there is a turning lane.  If you are on Banksville Road heading away from town, you will be making a right turn on to Banksville Avenue just after passing the Days Inn.  There is also a street sign that you may not notice coming the other way.

It should also be noted that they have restricted hours.  They are only open Wednesday through Sunday and are closed from November until March.  They also have an outdoor tent with picnic chairs in case you just can't wait to get home.  

I know it's almost time for PBC to close up shop, but making it over for another round before November is definitely on my to-do list.",2012-10-22 07:19:48

Pros:
Nice location in Old River

Ability to join the waitlist via Yelp on busy days

Diverse menu-- burgers, mac, sandwiches, pizza, etc.

Unique menu items-- the burgers in particular are superbly unique (some burgers come with toppings like peanut butter, crispy shallots, short rib, and more)

Attentive and friendly server who refilled drinks promptly

I loved the toppings on my One Red door burger and thought it was a unique topping for a burger that tasted delicious.

Cons:
Way overpriced.  My burger was $11 dollars for just the burger.  To add on a side of fries was $4+ dollars more depending on your fry type.  

Food took way too long to come out for an early Friday night when the restaurant wasn't full

Our starter (the kobe beef corn dogs) came out with our meal instead of as a starter (not sure if there was some miscommunication here)

Burger not cooked appropriately.  I asked for medium and it was cooked medium well to well-- no pink at all.

Truffle fries were just so so.  Most of the truffle oil was on the very top few fries.  As you worked your way down, it got less and less flavorful.  Most of my truffle fries were also not a complete fry and just a one inch end piece, like i had been given the bottom of the bag or something.

Bun on my burger was not good. It was a basic sesame seed bun in which the sesame seeds were a little burnt.  Additionally, for such a gourmet and unique burger, the bun just seemed too traditional and didn't quite match the rest of the burger.  I feel like something like ciabatta bread, etc. would have been a better fit.

It is super loud in this restaurant, so not a great place for a conversation.

I may stop in again and give them another try because their burger fix-ins were so delicious.  I had my eye on the short-rib burger but the One Red Door burger won out.  However, it definitely won't be high on my list to revisit.",2018-06-02 01:56:44

I was just setting off on a one-mile walk to the Distillery District, when I realized that, after eight hours already that day of tramping around the city, what I really wanted was to sit and drink a beer and read a book.  So that's what I did...for two hours and five beers.  

I had my choice of three adjacent outfits, but I picked MacCool's because of the waitress uniforms.  Go ahead and bash me, but I have a serious weakness for lovely young ladies in plaid skirts and knee socks.  The skirts don't even have to be short (these were respectably above the knee).  Black t-shirts, black knee socks, black/grey/white plaid skirts?  Sold.  Okay, okay, I'm ashamed of myself...but not really.  My server ""Sarah"" was beyond adorable.  I just wanted to gobble her up.

So the beer selection is not stupendous but it serves the purpose, especially in summer (or maybe they're smart enough to be seasonal).  Erdinger and Hoegaarden are both great choices.  I moved on after that to Kilkenny, then Guinness, then a local brew called Alexander Keith.

I can't vouch for the food, but there have to be much better choices in town.  Come for the patio and the skirts, stay for the beer,  The interior is charming too.",2009-08-25 04:48:06

_uLUpnFxIAWC7GlznxlwUA,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,tUjyGFSN8wQqLgKp5Q0CUA,4,5,4,4,"Having watched the buzz about Jonathon Sawyer grow slowly ever since a since a somewhat hit-and-miss experience at The Greenhouse Tavern in 2012 it was with great anticipation that a reservation at Trentina was made for three people at 6:30 Saturday evening, the $115 Menu Bianco proving not only that the Chef has indeed developed over the intervening years, but also that there may be a place for upscale locavore dining in Cleveland.

Opened in 2014, a James Beard Award for the Chef soon to follow, Trentina sees Sawyer and Chef De Cuisine David Kocab take on the concept of Northern Italian cuisine by way of Ohio Farmers, the classic plates of the Trentino region reinterpreted with a focus on bold flavors focused on simple elegance at the peak of season.

Taking over an old building on the edge of CWRU Campus, the interior sparsely designed but decorated with bold abstracts that couple with the mellow soundtrack to offer a casual elegance to the night, it was at one of several four-tops that our trio was seated and with menus already in place the only question was how much a la carte to be added, the eventual decision being three plates plus one significant substitution.

Well portioned for a tasting, each course following Thomas Keller's idea of the plate being satisfying while still leaving diners for want of 'one more bite,' dining began with three forms of housemade charcuterie including Llama Sausage plus shaved Egg 'bottarga,' the richness and funk well compensated by way of house pickles including semi-sweet Pears and otherwise thrown-away 'rescued' Broccoli stems.

Preaching whole food usage and sustainability, Ricotta Fritters dusted with the dehydrated peel of Tomatoes while a plate of raw Trout found nuance in Beets, Pickled Pears and Paw-Paw, course four featured the first ""add-on"" option, Trentina's much praised Potato Pizza showing brightly with yeasty bubbles and great pliability beneath a hint of ash, rich Ragu and Provolone Cheese tinged in Rosemary.

Showing a great degree of diversity as the menu progresses, courses to follow including Grilled Maitakes over an unfried cube of Bamboo rice ""Arancini,"" Pan Seared  Sweet Potato Gnocchi brought into season with Cinnamon and Apples plus a delicate filet of Red Snapper unbagged tableside with notes of Wine and Artichokes, one of the highlights of Trentina's everyday menu is undoubtedly the Bread service, a crisp balloon of air and sour notes already delicious and all the better when dipped in the slowly melting Beef Fat Candle.

Adding three portions of pasta to the meal, two available in an appetizer size while the crispy-edged Lasagna is only offered as a weighty full rectangle, one would be hard pressed to fault any aspect of the trio's price-point or execution, the ""Beef Osso Bucco"" pairing Shank to springy Gnocchetti while Cavatelli went off the grid to set seared Grapes next to Radicchio poached in Brown Butter, the tasting-only 'Estruso' perhaps envisioned during a brainstorming session for Sawyer's Noodlecat concept as the tubes of Rigatoni sang beneath funky ""XO Sauce"" and Parmesan.

Well sated at this point, even a single added plate likely too much for the average diner when put on-top of the Menu Bianco, savories ended in roasted Delicata Squash from a nearby farm followed by a slice of Duck Liver given the ""PB&J"" treatment over housemade Focaccia, the clever concept of a ""Re-Do"" presented giving diners a second look at a course he or she enjoyed previously.

Using regional Italian Cheese to make a custard topped in smoked almonds and local Honey before moving onto dessert, the Panna Cotta an all-out disaster both in terms of its rubbery texture and off-putting flavor, better bites were found in the campfire favorite Semifreddo accompanied by toasted Marshmallows and Graham Cracker crumble, one last bite of Carrot Cake better than either of the desserts in the opinion of nearly everyone in the dining room and thankfully sending all off with fond memories of what is the first 'destination-worthy' meal I have had in the State of Ohio.",2016-11-02 21:04:49

Roti w/ curry - this was the least greasy, yet puffy roti I've had. We both sat there wondering how they got away with so little oil while making it crisp and still fluffy inside The yellow curry that came with was pretty decent as well.

Crispy Beef - this was hard to tell this was soy beef aside it from not having any kind of strong beefy flavor. They know how to fry up something crispy here as the sauce never made the crisp outside sog AT ALL and it was not a greasy dish either. I wish every Chinese restaurant knew the Veggie House secret.

5 Vegetable Delight - this was subtle, but solid vegetables. The sauce is a light soy and ginger and it had lotus root, mustard, mushrooms (black fungus and shiitake), snap peas, carrots and cashews. 

We ate everything up but didn't feel overly stuffed or get that ""itis"" you get when you just eat some filling, fatty, salty stuff. Definitely not feel guilty food at all. 

I'm glad there is a place like this around. My own caveat is for a place that is ""Veggie House"" there wasn't many JUST vegetable dishes there, but I digress. I'm just not keen on fake meats, but that beef was good. 

Service here is pretty good. Checking on us and drinks were refilled and didn't stay empty very long which is much appreciated on a hot summer day. 

Must come if you're vegetarian/ vegan , definitely worthy even if you're not. The uncommon meat substitutes are definitely a foodie adventure in their own right.",2013-06-10 00:14:04

Now keep in mind they do not have AYCE, which is good because you don't have meat just lying out until it is all gone; quality control is what I would say about their meat!

Now for beginners or people who never been to a Asian BBQ style restaurant like this, I would suggest ordering al la carte first.  I know they offer combo meal but it's a lot of food and you may be gambling with what you ""may"" like or not like.  You can always order as you cook.  Service is excellent and they check up on you in timely manners.  That was a big plus for me...we all know that server at that restaurant where the server just keeps coming back and interrupting...well that is not the case here.  

As for location, it is situated in a shopping center that offers multiple eatery places, sushi, mexican, etc.  The only thing I would be caution on is that it is located across the street from Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.  I can only imagine just how busy they may be during the weekend.  If you don't want to wait or be in a crowded situation, I would suggest going during the week days.

It was, literally, pizza dough with Nutella slathered all over it and it costs $13.  That I don't get.

So being that it's a bar located in the great city of Pittsburgh, I expect specials! Really dirt cheap specials is just the icing, or shall we say slightly foamy head, on the beer. 

$2 you call it, or in layman's terms, stick to beer unless you don't mind bottom shelf liquor.  Beggars can't be choosers here! I'll take it!  They had a DELISH Blue Moon Summer Ale on tap that I highly recommend. 

I may be a little bit of a weirdo about this, but once the special began they stopped serving the drafts in glasses and switched to barely 16 oz cups. Boo!  I'm not at a frat party! 

The service is great until it got packed, then you have to start looking really eager for your beer and make direct eye contact or you won't get noticed.  It would help to beef up the bartenders to at least 3 or 4, instead of two swamped girlies.

Josie will also break a pose down in her Power Flow 1 class, so you can actually learn how to do the more advanced poses. Don't be afraid to make a request! 

The evening classes fill up fast, so I recommend getting there 15 minutes early. Also, look out for the sweat! The hot classes will make you drenched.

I'd like to add that Christy Pang is the best manager ever. I'm a student and leave for breaks often. She has worked with me to put my auto-pay on hold and is super responsive via email. Plus, she is super friendly and sweet! All around, she brings a great energy to the studio.

Although, getting a good gyro is really not an easy task.  If you are ever in Seattle, go to Mr. Gyro's on Greenwood Ave and you will understand what a good gyro is.

This gyro had meat, tomato and onion.  That is hardly how you make a gyro.  Not to mention the Tzatziki sauce was awful.  The pasta salad was okay.  The lady taking the order -  how do I say this:  Not rude, but almost there.  Not friendly, but not rude, but not exactly chipper.  

This is the kicker:  I saw they had a gyro with pasta for 6.50 (special), so I ordered a gyro. She asked me what side I wanted, so I had her say what the choices were.  She told me soup, pasta salad, fries, and steamed veggies.  So I chose the fries.  She then told me the total was 10 dollars and change.  I was like....what?  She repeated the total.  Changing gears and clarifying it wasn't my hearing that was in question, I asked for further details on why the price jumped 4 dollars with choosing fries instead of the pasta salad.  She told me the pasta salad was on special.  Still not believing this and that there must be more to it, I then asked if the gyro's were the same size, and she said yes.  At this point I was tempted to just cancel the order based on the logic of this restaurant in charging 4 more dollars for a difference between choosing fries vs pasta,and that the gyro was probably going to suck.

Albert was quick, friendly and efficient. He even helped me order slightly off menu to be sure I got what I wanted.

She was very friendly. I tried the two orange wines and settled on the Toscana, Tunia, Chiarofiore $13. I never had orange wine before. It was so good. The other orange wine by the glass was a Colli Piacentini, Denavolo, Dinavolino 2015. That one was more floral and to me it tasted a bit like ham in a glass in a good way lol. There's no english menu. They really should have one. My friend and I shared the three spreads : pistachio pesto, sunflower garlic and carrot purée, and baba ganoush (eggplant) with croûtons. My favorite was the baba ganoush. It was a bit spicy. The pistachio pesto was also good. I didn't care for the sunflower garlic carrot one. It was too earthy tasting for me. My friend wanted to try the artichoke. She said it was chewy and she kept spitting it out. so gross. We also had the lentil croquettes which was good but not wow. I had the La Source cocktail which reminded me of a Hendrick cucumber cocktail. It was very fresh. It consists of gin, cucumber, fresh herbs, lemon and simple syrup. The bartender also invented a cocktail for us to try. It was such a fresh and light summery drink. It contained an aperitif red liquor from Italy, with soda and Canadian club. It was so good! Lastly i had a dry Riesling (Alsace, 'Andlau', Domaine Kreydenweiss 2014) which I also enjoyed. The food is meh but the drinks and wine are good.

Nearby there are many restaurants and many bars. Of course, bay street, Eaton centre, the CN tower and many other attractions are within walking distance as well. 

On the outside, the hotel seems sub-par, however, once inside, you are greeted by a modernly renovated lobby area. The rooms are renovated as well and generally, it is quite clean. The wood flooring in the rooms is much more reassuring of cleanliness to me than carpet would be. 

Additionally, I planned a surprise party at a hotel room and the staff were very willing to help. I really appreciated it and I will remember this hotel when I am in Toronto next time.

There are some downsides however. Parking is 20-30/night. The cheaper option means you need to be out by 12pm otherwise you will need to pay the more expensive price. Another downside is the really really slow elevator. It was a bit awkward waiting for so long.

I live in a 2 bedroom 2 bath. It's in great shape and the floor plan makes it feel really homey. I wish the living space was bigger, but the bedrooms make up for it. I also have lots of closet space (plus built ins). In addition, all two bedrooms come with a free 5x5 storage room. Score. 

Like I said, over time I'll update this review but here are the basics: 

PROS
- location! 
- big apartment size
- comparable pricing in area 
- decent size pool
- quiet 
- modern updates to apts 
- free gas with fireplace apts
- large closets with built ins 
- dining room area 
- FAST maintenance 
- gym isn't crazy busy
- free gym classes 
- mix of young professionals and families (some college students- boo)
- did I mention location?!?!!

CONS
-little noisy on weekend, but nothing to complain about 
-extra storage isn't in your building (at least ours isn't) 
- parking sometimes sucks 
- limited guest parking
- you can hear traffic, but you live in the city. Get over it.

I actually haven't had Indian food since I've moved here - there just aren't that many places and they aren't cheap like the Bay Area - so when I found a place in Vegas that had curries for as little as 3.49, I couldn't pass it up.

One could easily have a good meal here for around 6 dollars - an 8 ounce serving of curry and a naan or some rice. And if you go for a groupon/yelp/amazon deal, you could have meals for 2 for 3 whole days! The Amazon deal we used was a 20 for 10 deal and we got 3 different curries, 3 garlic naan, and a mango lassi and only paid about 3 dollars on top of the deal we got.

While the curries here aren't the most flavorful or original, they taste (to me) pretty authentic. The naan wasn't wrapped up in the best method - they just kind of stuffed 3 into one foil, but they still tasted very good anyway.

The truth is if I could just keep eating, I'd probably stuff my face with naan and curry until I burst, but then this food wouldn't be so economical...",2014-04-08 03:19:03

I also loved the attention and care of the staff and additional points for a convenient downtown location! 

However, I must admit that they fall very short when it comes to food portions/quality compared to pricing. Maybe I have a bigger appetite than most, maybe I'm cheap and maybe I expect a lot from a brunch 
( how can you not with all the different amazing brunch choices in Montreal and it's brunch, it's supposed to be filling and uber satisfying ), but It just didn't cut it for me.

I ordered a Jasmine tea ( $3, usually tea or coffee is included or cheaper in other restaurants), then took the vegan omelet for  ( $10 ) which on top of being small only came with a salad, no other sides ( just salad leaves and cherry tomatoes, where are my potatoes, bread or fruits?? ) + a side of fruits ( $3 ).  Since neither I or my friend ( who took eggs benedict ) were full, we ordered the Apple pancakes ( $14 ) to share. These were supposed to come in 3, but they only served us 2 because supposedly the ones they usually serve were smaller in size ( baffling as the pancakes they served were actually small ). On top of this, there were no apples or applesauce included. Granted after I explained this to them, they made me another batch of 2 pancakes on the house.

All in all, while the experience and food weren't the worst, the impression I have of Lov is that they target the type of crowd who cares more about appearance then actual substance. As someone who is vegan, I really find such places annoying because it confirms the stereotype that eating a plant-based diet is unaffordable and unsatisfying when it really isn't.

Lastly, upon placing the reservation, there is a section to mention an occasion, I indicated that it was my birthday and there was no acknowledgment of this - In that case, what's the point of asking to specify an occasion?!

All in all, I would not go back to Lov unless they reconsider their portions/quality to be more in alignment with their prices.

Once I finally get someone, they tell me they will send it to the route manager and I will receive a call to tell me how they are going to resolve my issue. Never have received a call and have to keep calling back and get promises that they will bring my correct order the next day but it never shows up. Finally after many calls, they come and they screw up the correction to the original order they screwed up.

I am supposed to get three bottles of spring water and a case of plastic half litter bottles every two weeks. They will deliver two bottles of purified water and no half liter bottles. I call over and over and get them to finally come back to give me the three bottles of spring water and the case of half liter bottles and all they delivered was two bottles of spring water.

It finally came, it looks not bad with home fries..however when I cut the first one, the egg was fully cooked!! The other one is 80% cooked...no runny egg yolk!  The hollandaise sauce was alright...not the best but not the worst.  Homefries was bland!

Lets start with the name...why on Earth would you name your brewery Bad Water - beer is mostly water and I certainly don't want to think about anything bad to do with my beer's ingredients. 

Next thing, there are 3 beers offered here and of the three, well actually no, they're all really REALLY terrible. There's an IPA, and I love IPAS, but this one is lacking in hops, nose, flavor so basically a poor man's hopped water. The saison is equally bad with an overly alcohol forward, almost acetone-like flavor which overpowers the nice belgian yeast you're looking for in this style and then the lager. Well, that's the best one and I don't even like lagers as a style but it's the least offensive beer they have. 

Sure there are guest taps (Uncle Bear's, Angry Orchard, maybe an Oak Creek Hefe), but there are much better beer bars in the area - Craft 64 to name one standout. Also, there are some nice tables and decent cheese boards to enjoy here. So if you don't like beer, you might like it here? Honestly though, its a brewery and they are doing a disservice to the awesome AZ beer scene by calling themselves that. Go to Goldwater or Two Brothers, you'll be glad you did.",2016-02-04 22:54:02

Upon my arrival I was appreciative that the front desk was able to accomodate me and get me a room in the early afternoon. I knew I was in trouble however, when he said, ""Oh, yikes. All we have available is a bad room."" UM...WHAT?! And bad was right. Expressed in the most polite way, he meant that the room was only accessible through going outside and that the windows looked out on (and offered no protection from) the nightclubs just below. Darn! Usually a pretty deep sleeper, I thought this would't really be an issue. But if you're coming here on a weekend, definitely expect a lot of noise. The front desk offers earplugs for guests that need them and they really do their best to make your stay nice.

More problematic than the street noise though, was the actual guests. The rooms have laminate floors and for some reason the people staying in the room above me we wearing high heels (and walking in circles?) all. night. long. Even as last as 2am! It sounded like horses clopping around above my head. And in addition to the street noise - and I'm not joking - a very drunk man kept screaming obscenities in the hall and was trying to gain access to all of the rooms on the third floor. Security was quick to answer my call and assist in getting this guy down to the front desk to sort out his room key issues. Sadly though, they let him loose again at some point because within just minutes he was back, screaming at my door and trying to get in. At 3am! Security was back and finally he was gone for good. Turns out he was so intoxicated that he wasn't even on the right floor. And just as I thought I'd get to sleep, I was subjected yet again to loud noises emanating from yet another nearby room. This time it was.... errr... romantic noises? And while it was almost laughable that this place was so loud, I also recall hearing toilets flush in other rooms. The real issue isn't how loud the other guests our but how well sound travels. It's a shame, really. But I've got a co-worker who traveled through during the week and had no such noise issues.

The bed was cozy, the hairdryer provided in the room was great, I liked the Aveda products for the shower and I am always pleased when hotels have full length mirrors. So while my stay wasn't perfect, there were a lot of great things about the Indigo. If you're in town to stay up late, party and have a blast, this is the hotel for you.

I figured I would come with an open mind and give it my full attention. We were greeted with a smile at the door and immediately seated. We didnt see our server for over 5 mins(had my phone paid attention). She was kind and took our drink order but didnt come back for another 5+ mins with our order 2 waters.  Were ready to place our food order by this time but she just dropped the waters off with no words and kept moving. 
  In my first experience at this place I realized they think they are some sort of ""High End"" special type place. Seafood in Vegas woo hoo. The pricing on the menu should mean High Quality and Attentive service. The service was definitely not that. 
  We ordered and appetizer(Crab cakes) and two entrees Swordfish and Softshell crab. The crab cakes came out fast but the plate was large and there were two small crab cakes with burned edges and a tiny ramekin of an indistinguishable sauce(1000 island mixed with tartar sauce?). No garnish and they were only a tiny notch above a frozen crab cake from the grocery store. 
  The entrees took about 21 mins which is not horrible for a friday night, unfortunately we were there on a saturday afternoon when the place wasnt even busy. The softshell crab was over breaded and came on a bed of french fries that ranged from mooshy and undercooked to hours of drying under a heat lamp. My girlfriend said the crab itself  tasted ok but was not nearly a $20 plate of food.
  I had blackened swordfish. Expecting to have seasoned crust on the top I was quite surprised when the fish came out with a light wet red paste of seasoning on top sitting in a plate of juice.  I started eating and the flavor wasnt bad but the texture was really off with the pasty seasoning and rubbery fish. I went to the roasted zuchini for a reprieve but was even more put off when I realized the zuchini was basted in a ridiculous amount of fish juice. All this made more sense when I got about 2/3rds the way through the fish. Raw, straight up raw swordfish which explains the ridiculous amount of juice on the plate and nasty texture. Now I dont know how long it takes to cook swordfish but surely in the time it took to deliver our food they could of cooked the fish.
 This is the kicker here though. I stopped eating and just picked at my girlfriends fries. Leaving the fish bloody raw side up sitting on my plate. The waitress returned to the table 2 times to refill our waters but never once asked why I wasnt eating nor even noticed the uncooked fish on the plate near the edge of the table. She even came back a 3rd time and removed our plates dropped the check and didnt comment at all. We paid and ran for the hills. Gladly my girlfriend now understands why I dont want to go back.

There was only one table on the weeknight that we visited. The owner's little boy was running around which didn't bother us at all. He was kinda cute, coming up and checking lil guy out and then running off again. We noticed he was playing with the stereo system and commented on how funny it would be if he suddenly turned the volume up really loud. 

I perused the menu and located some of the items I wanted to try and promptly ordered.

Roti canai ($3.25) is a must when eating with hubby and lil guy. The one here was outstanding. The accompanying curry sauce with a piece of chicken and potato was so flavorful that lil guy ate the entire thing on his own. Hubby and I ate a piece each to taste. Lil guy even ate the spicy curry sauce and it wasn't lame like the one at Satay Malaysian Grill. This one had some heat to it. I was very proud that lil guy's taste buds were so refined, and most of all refined enough to like this one over the one at Satay. He was right, this one was far better than the one at Satay.

My other favorite dish is Hainan Chicken Rice ($5.75) and when it arrived I immediately dove in. WOW. The chicken was tender, the soy sauce was perfect and the accompanying chili/ginger sauce was awesome. I had to ask for more sauce it was THAT good. The chicken flavored rice was also delicious. Lil guy even liked this dish. I was very very happy.

We also got the Hokkien Char Mee or Hokkien style fried noodles ($6.95) was the weakest dish of all. They used the wrong noodles.... should've been egg or 'oil' noodles in Chinese, but it tasted like they used a variation of udon noodles. It was either that or they overcooked it so the texture became mushy. Wrong texture but good flavor.

Service was so-so, not bad but not outstanding. However, the meal was excellent so I was happy. I'm definitely coming back for more Hainan chicken rice next time we're in Vegas. I'm docking half a star for the noodles so 4.5 stars!",2007-08-25 00:10:16

We passed by Hickory Tavern, realized we hadn't eaten there yet and decided to give it a whirl. I wish Duckworth's had been open at the time because we would have definitely gone there over here in a heartbeat. Hickory Tavern offers the fare of a pub but with a chain restaurant quality that is just lacking a bit.

Hickory Tavern is located among a couple of other stores and restaurants a little past Birkdale Village. The parking was ample and we strolled in around 7:30ish. The place was pretty slow and we had no trouble snagging a patio table, with only two other parties eating out there at the time. Our server was very attentive but service was pretty dang slow considering how quiet the place was.

I ordered the Tavern Burger ($9.30) which was a simple, overpriced cheese burger. You can only order the burger medium well or well, which is something I hate about getting a burger at a chain establishment. Despite the fact I ordered it ""slightly pink"" it came out ""not a trace of pink."" It was a decent size, but I didn't think the quality was worth over nine bucks. It did come with a side, and I chose the fruit cup, which was decent. 

The missus' went with the Build Your Own Salad ($8.50) and added shrimp to it for an extra $3. The vegetables were ok but not all the greatest quality for an entree salad. If my burger was overpriced then her salad was even more so, seeing how adding any protein to the salad would have cost more than my burger. 

I was not impressed with Hickory Tavern. It was overpriced for what you get, and the quality of the food was just sub-par. There are plenty of other alternatives in the area that offer the same bar-like experience with better food and prices. I don't think I'll ever step foot inside again.",2013-07-05 21:22:38

Shabu Grill has two flavors of soup - spicy and regular. We did half/half. I went for regular while someone else in my party went with spicy. The regular really doesn't have any flavor which was disappointing since I've had curry soup before and that was delicious, but I got over it because it was time to start cooking food.

The fridge had several different types of vegetables, like spinach and pumpkin, and meats, like pork belly, shrimp, and crab legs. There is a sauce station, but I only grabbed green onions to toss into my half of the hot pot because I'm not much of a sauce person.

Everyone tells you to skip the salad bar at these Brazilian Steakhouses, but it's impossible. Everything up there is just so delicious. It's not like the salad bar at the bbq place. I mean, there's great food up there. I think you could do just fine with that and skip the meatfest. Whoa! What am I thinking!

Twenty different kinds of meats on skewers make the rounds of the dining room. Prime rib, sirloin, pork loin, bacon wrapped filet mignon, lamb chops, even platters of fresh baked salmon and swordfish. I felt bad for the kid with the Brazilian sausages and the chicken. I mean, sure we'll give it a try, but that's not why we're here. Tip on the lamb chops. They're ten times better with some of the mint jelly. Yes, mint jelly. Trust me on this.

Fantastic service. Rich and Clint did a super job of taking care of us.

It's a touch on the spendy side. $50 each for the dinner, plus drinks and tip. But you can get a discount coupon online from their website at the moment. Note that there is an 18% tip included with the bill already. At least the line on the check says ""extra tip"", so now you're warned.

Dress is not casual, but they still seemed to let people in with jeans and tshirts. Yes, I'm talking to you in the bright yellow ""Super Mario Brothers"" tee. Seriously, dude. This isn't Bubba's BBQ Barn. Show a little class.",2011-11-19 02:09:33

I guess I'm out the loop cause I've never heard of the Shake Shack.  I just happen to drive past it the day of its opening and then heard about it later on that night. So I went there the next day to see what all the fuss was about.

There was a pretty good size line going outside.  But they were very efficient at handling the line.  I got my order and food in less than 30 minutes.  Cons:  The fries I didn't think were that good.  They were just too hard like they were overcooked and I didn't like the taste of the cheese sauce.  It definitely is a acquired taste.  Pros:  The Black and White shack was fantastic!  I felt that It compliment the burger quite nicely.  As for the burger itself...Amazing!  If I could describe the burger it was as if In & Out burger, Five Guys, and SmashBurger had one big threesome and had a baby.  The burger is the size of a In & Out, The meat has the look of a Smashburger.  And the patty has the moistness of FIve Guys...only better.  But the taste from this piece of beef is all Shack.  I can't recall having a burger that was as juicy as this burger.  Each bite was juicier than the last. I didn't try the custard or the chicken sandwich.  I heard those were really good as well, so I will be back to try those next time.  They also serve beer there as well.  The girl working the counter told me as I was waiting for my food if I ever had Shake Shack?  I told her that I haven't.  She told me that I will not be disappointed.  She was absolutely right. Welcome to AZ Shake Shack.",2016-02-29 07:58:05

My nephews had a great time and loved all the cool pinball machines.  Kept them occupied for a while. I took advantage of the Yelp deal (which, although a great deal, probably more than I needed to spend on tokens for pinball) and my dollars stretched pretty far. Most machines were only 2 tokens and at an exchange rate of quarter=token we played a lot. 

I love the nostalgia and simplicity of the parlor. The decorations were so fun and I loved how classic the games were. Just like when we were kids- I didn't need a menu or snack bar or even booze. (that was needed AFTER my day spent with the littles).  

When Brooklyn got bored, there was plenty to look at and keep her occupied. She may have re-decorated the dinosaur display and for that, Superelectric Pinball Parlor folks, I apologize. I'll be back.

I like this location because it's close to home, the sushi is always fresh and you can't beat the price.  My daughter and I really had our heart set on sushi from Pacific East, so we ventured to the Coventry location and I'm glad that we did!  I thought the Coventry location was even better.  We normally opt for the dinner combo at the Woodmere location, which includes house salad with ginger dressing, miso soup (we substitute the shitake mushroom soup for a slight upcharge) and 1, 2 or 3 rolls of your choice.   Very happy that the same special was offered at Coventry.  The salad was fresh and well dressed.  The mushroom soup (I crave this soup), was even better here, nice broth full of charred onions, garlic, mushroom and a wedge of lemon and I opted for the shrimp tempura roll and California roll.  My daughter ordered the tuna and California.  We were both very pleased with our meals.  The staff was super nice and very accomodating.

Very cozy, financial district decor, the chairs were plush, the lighting was pretty and it just felt like money inside, as if I should be dining with Don Draper. 

We ordered 1 meal off the summerlicious menu ($35 dinner), and that was a really big disappointment. The pig and parsley terrine was soft and good but the bread and the chichorron that came with it felt stale and was chewy. You can tell its been pre-made and sitting out for a while because the sauce had built a thin film on top. The salmon entree felt cold and the skin wasnt crispy fried. The dessert was the worst part - got the coconut sponge cake - not spongey at all - it was hard as a rock, dry as a brick. For summerlicious I'd stay far far away. 

However, we also order items off their regular menu. The tuna appetizer was good ($19)- but not memorable, the fish itself was good and nice and raw in the middle, but there was an odd spicy sauce that I couldnt figure out what it was. The mushroom soup was ok - at least it came out somewhat warm. The redeeming part of the meal was the $100 - 20oz ribeye for 2 - it comes out on a large platter with potatoes and carrots. It also comes with a bone marrow, which was the best part. The steak was good, wasnt chewy and again came out hot. The tiramisu dessert coffee was good, but felt a bit small and you could finish it in about 5 gulps.

The food was good as well.  Granted I find their sushi menu to be repetitive (a big list of fancy names but basically all very similar). Took us a while to decide on which 2 won't be too much alike.  It's of good portion and quality. The nigiri looked fresh and wasn't packed with rice. 

I was pleasantly surprised with my experience that night.  Now I will have to find out if it can be repeated in the future or if this was a one hit wonder.

Bad; First things first, the positioning of the grill, it's awkward. It truly takes one on each side of the table to cook the food.

I'd been to a similar one in Los Angeles (Woodland Hills, I think). This is great for birthday parties, too. Plenty of jumping opportunities. Be smart and have a short sleeve shirt to wear while there, or they'll get too hot.

Staff here is very helpful and pleasant. Very low-key, but attentive. Good combo! 

Stash your street stuff in the secured lockers on premise, don the non-slip socks provided, then go! Rock climbing, or basketball dunking, or dueling with giant soft puffy sticks over a pit of spongy shapes. Or just jump, jump!!

Chicken Katsu was my choice.  Hard to mess up that order.  Tasted just as good as other places that I've had it.  (3.5 stars)

Spicy Seafood Soup was flavorful and filled with good stuff!  Everything went well together in this concoction!  (4 stars)

I purchased my vehicle from this location and have been receiving all services from them. I purchased a certified used car with 28K miles and currently have 56K miles so I've been coming here for a while. I received a tire rotation 23 days ago here ($75) but now apparently I need 2 new tires- they quoted me for +$560 for 2 tires not counting rotation. I haven't traveled much in the past 23 days if not less due to the inclement weather so I'm not sure why this wasn't discovered 23 days ago. 

A little shady if you ask me. I try to support businesses and be loyal to those I frequent but I no longer trust this company.

Big slab of pork katsu (with its own little tonkatsu dipping sauce) and the curry broth was actually realllllly tasty. It wont blow your mind like sansotei or santouka but still very flavorful.

Out of all the times I came, I never once received an egg that was overcooked (it was always liquid gold). So I guess some reviewers got unlucky with slightly overcooked eggs in their ramen.

The noodles were nice and firm, just the way I like it. Good springiness and chewy. The pork is normally very good. On two of my visits, my cutlet was slightly overdone (but really good crunch).

A bowl here will set you back $11-13. Pretty similar to what most legit ramen shops charge nowadays. I crush the curry broth to the last drop every time. 

Fair warning. The place is quite small and the owner's wife is the sole waitress AND cashier, not to mention shes SUPER FRIENDLY. She does front of the house while he cooks in the back.

I saw all of this while I stopped in for a drink one night.  I enjoyed to vibe and with so many options I needed to come back to try it. 

My boss and I had a colleague in from out of town so we decided we would give it a try. (Once we sat down I knew i was going to be very full once I left).  We decided to start out with their hummus sampler, it came with homemade Pita (seriously do not go here on a diet because it is irresistable).  Each of the selections we tried were fantastic, the best one we had was the Veggie!  After that the waitress expressed how we had to try the robata's - between three of us we may have gotten every single one.  The shrimp, peppers, and short rip were delicious! 

After we finished yet another course we got two sushi rolls and then also ordered an entree to split.  The sushi was fresh and not too much rice, I really could have eaten the whole thing but I didn't want to embarrass myself with work friends, and I was really full.  We entree we shared was the roasted cauliflower and lentils. I realize everything I'm saying makes it sound like I am a vegetarian but I can promise you I am not!! But to jump back, it was so good, not mushy or overly spiced, really was a perfect side dish to everything.  

Again, this time around I saw burger and spicy chicken pass me by and I contemplated asking them for a bite, but knew after how good all the food we had was I would be back.

I'll keep this short - the man is a jack of all trades, no surprises, and he just jumps in and starts to get things done, including running down the road a few blocks to get some things at Home Depot.

He even told me that one of the things I needed fixed, didn't need fixed, but just needed to be cleaned a bit.

Why would I mention that first?  Because after reading the menu online I was WAY into the place (expectations up), then I read the reviews (expectations slightly down, but still high), I then heard rave reviews from a friend (shooting expectations up) so I suppose I was expecting something above and beyond what I got.  Mind you - it was still pretty good.  I'm actually looking forward to making the trip again.

My sandwich was good - though I hardly tasted any pesto and my cheese was not melted (On a pannini - it should be melted) - but not amazing.  The pizzas looked great and I'm anxious to try one.  Soup and salad was good, but quite simple - nothing outstanding once again.  That said, great location, good parking.  We were one of only 2 other tables at 11:30 but by 12:30 when we left the place was packed so my advice is to go early or late if you want a really good experience.  

Though it's been stated that it's a ""order at the counter"" kind of place, folks regularly came around to pick up extra plates and provide drink refills which was a nice unexpected touch.

It's a nice option for lunch - but it's also in an area of many Good, Nice, Great and even Amazing lunch spots.  So while there are ""better"" spots to go in the area, this isn't ever going to be a bad choice - especially during non-peak hours.",2007-02-14 18:56:05

My friend and I shared two apps and an entree. Plenty of food for the two of us. Hummus, stuffed grape leaves and a mixed grill. 
Hummus was smooth with great flavor of the chick peas. I really hate the supermarket stuff as its overloaded with acid and takes that nutty flavor away. Fresh warm pita sever at the table to accompany. 
Grape leaves. I'm sooooooo picky about these. Having a great recipe that I use from a very loving YaYa friend of the family, I'm weary to search out a comparison. What I do know is the time and painstaking love it takes to make them. These are stuffed with rice, no meat. Most often when I find these somewhere they are soggy, oil laden and just not good. Istanbul's are really fresh. 5 to an order. Rice is not mushy. You can tell they are made in small batches and often. 
Mixed grill was good as well.  Served with rice and fresh cabbage slaw and grilled pepper.

Sushi is expensive. I also understand that not just any restaurant gets access to high quality fish, especially in bumble fuck Chambana. None of these justify the price premium KoFusion demands over the (superior IMHO) Yelowfin, not to mention the also rans Kamakura and Miko. If decor doesn't matter, and cost is an object (when is it not?) Sushi Kame is the best bet.

As for their rolls, I do think they can be good. When they are good, they are just as good as the above restaurants. When they are not, they suffer the same perennial complaints for not being well rolled or being skimpy. I have not heard any complaints that their fish was bad, and I grant that this in itself is an accomplishment. The chirashi is reputedly quite good, though I have not had it.

Their ""deal night"" is not really a deal. They get you in with the promise of a cheap meal, but the pieces that are $1 each are really tiny. If you are a person who normally orders 2 rolls, you will not be happy with your 10 small (but good) pieces. You will end up ordering an additional roll and maybe more.

The feeling of a dozen daggers in your back and dozen sets of eyes silently drilling fiery holes through your pathetic self?

 I made a reservation weeks ahead of time, confirmed morning of, all was going well. 
 Our evening unraveled just about immediately. Our table was ready (yay) with zero wait, right on time. But then time came to figure out who will be taking care of us and when that person would make appearance. 
Guess what 14 people that got out of a day full of meetings want to do right away? Ding ding ding. I won't go into boring details, but it was 55 minutes from the time we sat down until every member of our party had a drink. No joke. Almost an hour. By that time first served were, yep, done with their drinks. We couldn't even kick off an evening with a toast. I get handcrafted cocktails, but was it possible to staff more than one bartender considering there was a three weeks advance notice?...
 The drink fiasco that dragged out for an hour put such a damper on everyone's mood, I'm not even sure anyone paid much attention to food. I tried calimari and will say it was delicious, my veggie burger was tasty, but fries were super lame. They were so inconsistent plate to plate, you couldn't really tell what they should taste like. Mine were golden brown, over fried and dry, the appetizer ones were thick and soggy. So bizarre. 
I will say, I dreaded food coming out as dragged out as the drinks, but it was actually very well timed and coordinated.

Hailing from the Baltimore area - I have the authority to say their lump crab appetizer or dinner is the best crab plate you can get.  You get a plate that is piled high with a hefty chunk of crab for a dang good price - order the same thing at Ruth Chris and you get 1/5th of crab for 4 dollars more.  Crab cakes are still done better in Maryland though!

Wine by the glass is a deal!  Order a chardonnay at Sulivans - 14 dollars, half glass.  Same glass of wine here - 8 dollars and filled to the brim.  

Cesar salads here are done perfect - I pushed my wedge out of the way to pick at my wife's Cesar last night.

To enjoy this place you will need to order a Prime Filet, medium rare.  For a fraction of the price you get a steak as good as Ruth Chris, just not covered in butter (not a bad thing).  They cook medium rare pretty well, and the prime is tender and butter textured

You want the best desert - 7 layer chocolate cake.  The full slice is enough to make you gain 3-lbs.  My wife and I weighed a full slice - it's almost 3-lbs!  They do offer it in the half slice - which weights just under 2!

The food arrived within literally 3 minutes and the plate was piled high! I cannot explain how amazing my meal was.

But I love them for other reasons, like their attempts to use more humanely raised beef, pork and chicken. 

Also the Chipotle in Midvale, UT used to donate food to the treatment center I worked at for women and children. So two days a week I got to eat it for lunch, and one time they messed up catering order. I was asked to pick up 40 free burritoes, hell yess I would, damn that was one heavy box but I got to take home 8 free burritoes! 

Anyway back to the basics, the beef is the closest thing to Carne Esada you will find in this town, the Carnitas are pretty good. Chicken is not my fav, ask for veggies on your burrito, and add Guac its worth it. 

I like that they have a variety of salsas to choose from, mild, med hot, and stock extra hot sauce. I just wish it was Cholula hot sauce but oh well.

It's no wonder I've never heard of this place until today.  The business is actually located in the lobby of a highly unusual office/retail building on 51st Ave just south of the 101.  If you're coming here, look for the office building labelled ""Monogram Salon Suites"".  Inside the building there's hair salons, massage therapists, a clothing boutique, and then right smack in the middle lobby area is this tiny kitchen/sandwich nook.  There were two chefs on duty (I believe their names are Jacob and Troy) working with tons of equipment in a space no bigger than your average office breakroom.  The chefs said their sandwich menu is still evolving, but they gave us a menu of what was being served that day (as well as displaying it on chalkboards above the cooking area).  I decided to go with the Caesar Chicken sandwich this go around.  I was going to choose sourdough as my bread, but the chef insisted I go with ciabatta as he felt it was a better accompaniment.  I also got a side of their tomato cucumber salad and a water.  Total price for everything including tax and tip was $8.  

Just an FYI, everything they make is from scratch so this isn't a fast food place per se.  Ours took about 10 minutes to make.  That said, you can order online for pickup in advance using Yelp, Eat 24, or Grubhub.  There's seating for maybe 10 people in and around the kitchen and that's it, but we managed to get a two person table for lunch.  I didn't know this but they press the Caesar into panini form, which was actually a pleasant surprise as the bread was warm and crunchy, but mostly retained a nice chewy interior.  The Caesar Chicken bore surprisingly little resemblance to a Caesar salad as it contained grilled chicken, pesto, tomato, lettuce, and mozzarella.  Despite the lack of resemblance, it was indeed a very delicious sandwich.  Warm, plenty of chicken, liberal amount of mozzarella and just the right amount of sauce.  The tomato cucumber salad was also a deliciously refreshing accompaniment and had just a hint of basil, salt, and I believe a little oregano as well.  Really excellent quality lunch for the price.  My co-worker got the turkey sandwich with turkey, bacon, provolone, spinach and onion on a baguette.  She too was extremely impressed.  A delicious lunch all around.

I'd only dock this place one star due to the fact that this place would not be ideal for groups or for a quick grab and go stop.  Plus the setup of the ordering process can be a little confusing as there's no register and there was only one menu available to look at this time around.  In many ways it was like ordering food from a bar.  All that being said, they have a really good online ordering system from which you can order your food for delivery or for pickup.  In talking with the chefs it sounds like they already have a pretty loyal band of folks that submit big catering orders (based on the Yelp reviews, I'd be hard pressed to disagree).  

So there you have it.  Another great find that I wouldn't in a million years have even thought to look for without Yelp.  And thus my lunch went from boring and subdued to exciting and fulfilling, all with a few taps of the trusty Yelp app.  West Valley Yelpers, go get yourself some sammiches.",2015-08-27 19:48:40

Came here the other night for the first time for summerlicious.

The cesar was good but I hate how at some fancier places they don't break up the lettuce nicely!! Kind of a pain in the butt. Oh well still tasted good and the dressing was good and not too cheesy.

The salmon was unbelievable except it said it would come with mango and red pepper and I'm not the biggest mango fan but figured I'd just pick it out, but if you look at my picture ...how much red pepper do you see? Yeah, not that much!!! lol

The cake was divine, I'm not sure really what it was made of but it tasted kind of moussey.

Hennessy's was bursting at the seams and it reeked of frat boys and stale green beer (already at 6 PM). There was nothing my group and I could do, except eat Italian on the most Irish day of the year!

Okay, so that's a little dramatic. But for St. Patty's Day my friend, myself, and my fiance found ourselves at Luna Rossa, which is a cute, new Italian food joint on Fremont Street. It has a very open seating area, and a bar, which is where we sat. Behind the bar you can see the open stove/oven where they cook their pizzas.

We ordered drinks and decided on splitting one of their large 12"" pizzas. Because my fiance is not as ""out there"" with his food choices, we kept it simple with the prosciutto pizza and an order of bruschetta to start with. The bruschetta had a nice tomatoey flavor, and I felt as though it was decent enough. The bread had a slight crunch, but not so much that I felt as though my teeth were going to fall out trying to eat it (I've had bruschetta like that before.. yuck). The pizza was a nice, thin crust. It was baked just right, not a piece of it was soggy, the crust had a slight burn, but not charred. I think it could have had a *bit* more sauce, but that could be just my personal preference. The prosciutto had a nice salty flavor and my fiance loved it! He has now found a new favorite food. The only thing is, the prosciutto pretty much comes entirely off the pizza once you take a bite of it, so it's hard to get a little prosciutto with every bite.

I would certainly recommend checking this place out if you need some food downtown. For the pizza, app, and 5 drinks our total came to $54. Honestly that aint bad for three people to have dinner and drinks!",2012-03-19 06:57:17

It is a long, thin restaurant with a slightly larger room in the back.  When you walk in, there is a long bar on one wall and a long series of tables along the other wall.  The tables are easily configured so that you can have parties of two or move tables together for larger parties.  I've come with parties as large as eight and they were accommodating for any size party.
The menu has a variety of options and although it changes seasonally, there are some items that seem to be staples and always on the menu.  There are a wide variety of appetizers, really something that will please every palate.  What I like is that although entrees are on the pricier side ($20+ each) there are appetizers that are substantial enough that you can make a meal from one or two of them.  
My favorite entrée I've had was a steak with chili rellenos.  It was packed full of flavor and a pretty substantial portion size.  In terms of appetizers, my favorites have been the yucatan bean dip and conch fritters.  Both are unique and full of flavor.

Since I was alone and the World Series game was on it seemed like a good opportunity. I have a way of telling whether not service will be fair, good, or excellent, and I could tell that service here was going to be about average or possibly a little lower than average. My waitress was the bartender, and she wasn't immediately attentive to my needs, but she did service me in a timely fashion. The front of the menu has the history of the family on it, and there's a typo, so when you're reading it makes you wonder about the attention to detail. For Mexican food their pricing overall is pretty high. The menu was not well thought out, and you don't feel like there's an opportunity for you to save a few dollars if you want to unless possibly you just order off of the side menu, which wasn't readily apparent. I had to ask if chips and salsa we're going to be served instead of it automatically being brought to me when I sat down at the table which is normally the custom at a Mexican food restaurant. Water was not offered to me either. I took a while to decide on the menu and finally decided on the combination plate having an enchilada and a taco with shredded pork. They serve the chips and salsa along with refried beans, and the chips are very fresh, thin, and salted very well and taste very good. The combination of chips and salsa and the refried beans is excellent and something they're known for. It's easy to over eat with the chips and salsa and refried beans before your meal is served. I could tell that my meal had probably stayed in the kitchen for a little while since it wasn't immediately served to me in the time that I would've anticipated it and the busyness of the restaurant. With Mexican food restaurants you can tell when the food is served to you whether or not the chef is passionate about their work. There's a fine line in Mexican food restaurants for food service and the food that is served, and I find that that fine line is here at this restaurant because that's how I feel that they are treading. They are treading on a fine line because their food is neither excellent nor really that bad. I suppose that you can have a business that's built on being average, and there are quite a few businesses that operate that way. I like to think the businesses are always striving to improve and to improve customer service. When things tend to turn in the opposite direction I think it's the time that the business needs to evaluate their operations and take time to train their staff accordingly and evaluate the quality of their food. This restaurant fits those criteria and gets three stars from me. It wasn't a bad recommendation, but I'm not certain how soon I'll be back. I think the one thing that I would say in closing is that if you come here just plan to take some time and have a little extra time and don't worry so much about all the details and just really enjoy yourself.",2017-11-02 01:59:34

As a current student attending UofT, Hart House is definitely a place that I come to often. (Gym facilities, library, study areas and Sammy's!) What lies in this old Manor is a small student cafeteria that offers a variety of food. They offer sushi, falafel, salad, smoothies, candies, pastries and so much more!

However, like the many reviews that I've read thus far, I find that Sammy's is inconsistent. When I order their infamous couscous salad it varies each time the amount that I'm given. Although, the portions may seem inconsistent, I do find the taste remaining the same. Then again, I usually just order their grilled chicken and their gourmet salads. 

I definitely would recommend Sammy's as an alternative to your food trucks you find on St. George, Tim Hortons, Starbucks and Second Cup scattered around campus.

In the past few days, I joked about wanting to check out a one star venue. I now feel the pain of the "" be careful what you wish for"" theory. 

I popped into Gilley's at TREASURE ISLAND for the ""first night of business"" aka #epicfail

As my friends and I were in line, we were notified by the ""host"" (guy in black polo indicating security) that there was a $20 cover, but free if we are guests in the hotel. Luckily, my friends were indeed guests at the TI and I snuck in with them. No way in hell I am paying cover for a bar inside a hotel...especially since it's not a club.

Next...why should I be paying cover for a place that hasn't even had it's grand opening yet? And shouldn't a complimentary cocktail ticket be in order? SOMETHING...ANYTHING?

Once we got in, we were introduced to a large dance floor a few people were line dancing. I'm not going to slam this place on it's ""culture"" because we chose to come to this ""country"" themed bar. But this place was kind of empty. Lame. Fail. Get me out. 

Next to the dance floor, there is a gigantic mechanical bull, where cougars, and less than attractive women pay five or so dollars to ride it. Fun for a little giggle. My friends rode the bull, and we took pictures. It was fun.

Unfortunately, the drunken messes before and after my friends, made the mechanical bull less of a novelty for tourists, and more of a shaming device for men and women who need a bull to feel ""wild"". I'm not going into this any further...use your imaginations. This place needs a better crowd...especially for the first night.

On to the drinks. Beer selection is your usual Budweiser garbage. No craft beer. Drinks are reasonably priced. A friend got a tequila shot (double) for $13. Beers are about $5. Reasonable for Vegas I suppose.

My real ""beef"" with this place isn't the bad beer, the crowd or the line dancing to Lady Gaga (yes, it really happened, and I have video). 

The fact that this was ""opening night"" and they were willing to charge people a $20 cover is disturbing. Also, they should have packed this bar with the plethora of girls and dudes that stayed at TI....this is spring break season. 

I'm no crystal ball or anything, but I don't believe this place will be in business long.

If you want the novelty of riding a mechanical bull, do it now, before this turns into a better, cooler joint.

Before I go, I do want to point out one thing. There are hot girls here, but they are the shot girls, and servers. It was all great for the usual ""ha ha"" the girl is wearing chaps. But it got old when this place was so dead, that these girls were dancing with hammered patrons. Count. Me. Out. 

Peace.

A local friend of mine took me here for lunch as she also wanted to show me the awesome shopping area it is in. We skipped over a super fancy place and chose this one - fancy in its own right but 'Florida-feel casual' at the same time.
Our waiter was really sweet - we got several wait staff helping us throughout our meal, actually. Some things took awhile like our waters and my coffee but overall, I liked our experience. 
I tried the chicken tortilla soup which was excellent and served hot. YUM! Little bits of sweet corn came on top. My friend had ordered an appie and a main and I knew that would be a lot for me for lunch but what the hell - I also got the blackened fish tacos. They were good - of course they do not compare to say, some you would get in Hawaii but they were quite tasty. I could only eat 1 out of 3 of them. Also on the side of the plate in addition to a lime, you get a little pineapple yogurt type dessert in a taco shell with beautifully fried plantains on top. OMG, I left full and of course I took my tacos with me!
My friend loved her lobster bisque as well as her chicken tacos and she too had a to-go bag!
My one comment would be that we had asked for all the dishes to come at one time but my soup came first and nothing else. Not even my friend's soup came so I felt a bit bad eating alone for a bit. But we said nothing and tipped very well.
Would love to go back next time I am in town, maybe for dinner sometime to see the mood of the restaurant at night.",2013-04-24 23:14:09

I've had a few roles here and everything has been decent.  It's the perfect place for a mid-week meal where you may be a bit tired from work and don't want to cook or craving sushi.  

We ordered a number of deluxe roles at various times including: Diablo, Sunkist, Spicy Salmon, Salmon Scallop, Caterpillar + others.  

The rolls were large and quality/freshness of fish was good everytime except once on 1 roll (still edible though.). The tempura on any of the shrimp was fresh and crispy, meaning they don't make a bunch in the morning and then throw them in the rolls as needed.  

The couple areas for improvement for these deluxe rolls and many sushi shops around the city, would be:. I) don't mix your hot sauce with tempura bits, it makes it soft and kills the crispy texture you're aiming to add.  II) drop the cream cheese from the rolls (personal preference) I'm not sure how cream cheese fits in some of the rolls however it kills the texture and adds a lot of calories.  

Service at Koja was good overall and staff are very friendly.
Onne instance they mixed up our order and we received two of the same roll.  No big deal...",2016-12-10 17:49:28

But, there is a reason to go there.  First, they have a good selection of organic produce at reasonable prices. The dried fruits and nuts are great too.  I buy all my son's organic juice there because it is cheap and good.

The cheese selection is great for the price point.  You can find the exact same cheese at Heinens down the street for a couple bucks more.  Boo to Heinens.  You can also get some great, sustainable frozen fish here.  We always stock up on the mahi-mahi to make sure we have it on hand.

Their steak tacos are to die for and are so filling I don't need the rice or beans so I get the tacos a-la-carte.  Their pico de gallo is pretty good, and that's coming from someone who usually doesn't eat tomatoes.  Their hot salsa had a heck of a kick as well.

The problem with this location is that it isn't well run.  The first visit was okay but the second was awful. The line was very long and we waited for 45 minutes only to be told they were completely out of steak and it was only 8:00 pm.  They could have said something because I am certain I wasn't the only person in line that was looking for it.  We were so frustrated that we left and went to SmashBurger instead which was across the street.

We went again last night hoping hat the previous visit was an anomaly.  Again there was a bit of a line but it moved fairly quickly this time, which was surprising because their staff was extremely disorganized and were mixing up orders.  The family in front of us had ordered quesadillas for their children but didn't get them and then when they went to pay their card was declined and the cashier was at a loss to what to do. She let us skip ahead of them and paid for our order but we had asked for chips and salsa and only got salsa so we weren't charged for chips but didn't realize that until we reminded them we didn't get out chips so we had to pay for them separately.

Im giving two stars since a 1-star review would be a terrible experience but at least the food was good this time.",2016-08-19 20:18:26

First off, before discussing the food, I want to note that I found a hair in my rainbow trout (which I know was definitely not my own). Another person in our group also found a hair in her food. This was quite off-putting.

Onto the food - I really enjoyed the appetizers, but the mains and desserts didn't impress me much. For the appetizers, the branzino (thinly sliced raw fish) was great. Nice texture, with tastes of lemon and olive oil. the deep fried seafood was also really nice. The seafood tasted really fresh. Charcuterie, squid pockets and oysters were good too.

For the mains, we tried duck yolk and black truffle pizza. I found the pizza to be too crispy and some parts were burnt. We tried two different pastas (one with tomato sauce and the other with duck in it), and while I enjoyed the texture of the pasta (you can tell its freshly made), I wasn't overly excited about the flavour of the sauces. The rainbow trout was very nicely done and prepared. They open it in front of you - it's covered in salt, basil and thyme (I think) and slowly cooked at a very slow temp. Side of green beans were good and flavourful. The zuchinni side was quite sour.

Desserts - the panna cotta was the hit at our table. Light and fluffy with sorbet underneath. Very nice light dessert. The olive oil cake was too dry and grainy. The semifreddo was really chocolaty and alcohol-y (which could be a good thing if that's what you're after!). Tiramisu was too dense/creamy for my liking.",2015-09-17 21:59:01

Our party of 5 was seated in a space for maybe 3 people. I was more a part of the neighboring party than my own. (Luckily, they were lovely, friendly people.) Drink options were sparse: the Vietnamese beers were out, leaving the ever-exotic Coors Light. 

The pho was good, but not overwhelmingly amazing. I've had pho with rich and flavorful broth that needed no additional ingredients. But, in a pinch this is pretty good, and not something I'd turn away to help shoo away the cold.

I have been wanting to visit a Lee's for a long time but could never seem to get there until now. It was worth the wait and now that I am moving to Chandler, I can go whenever I want!!

I am a huge fan of banh mi and my husband likes them too but is new to the concept. So I ordered him the grilled pork vietnamese sandwich and ordered myself a pork and pate one. The combo sandwich I wanted was not available but this did not dampen my experience. The bread the sandwiches are served on is special. Its creamy, flavorful, soft on the inside, slightly crisp on the outside. The meats inside are very good but they take second stage to the bread in my opinion. My mom complains that they skimp on the fillings but I didn't find that to be the case for me. A sandwich with bread that good would be overwhelmed by too much meat. For me, I felt the sandwich was balanced perfectly with the right amount of meat, pickled veggies, cilantro, and jalapeno.

Of course, we ordered the iced coffees which hit the spot and got us energized for our long afternoon. Next time I would order a large one because they really pack the cup full of crushed ice (this makes it nice and cold) so you don't get as much coffee.",2014-01-27 00:35:50

This place is super consistent & always on point.

Steak & fries are also delicious, and my husband just loves the Buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. I'll be back on Tuesday & may order the Maple Ribs (one of the only items I have not tried).

When I saw the Amorino sign at The Linq Promenade at Las Vegas, I got really excited.
We parked our car at the nearby parking lot for the Linq. Then we walked around the Promenade.
Amorino is located closer to the Las Vegas Blvd than the Linq parking lot.
It's a nice, little shop, but no restrooms, keep it in your mind! The closest are located right across, in the Flamingo Hotel lobby.

Besides gelato and sherbets, they are serving coffee, espresso, cappuccino, hot cocoa and other bottled beverages. Also macaroons, too!

My recent purchase included a Classic gelato for $8.95 (chocolate, mango and caramel), also a medium cup of organic chocolate and lemon for $6.95.
My Classic was prepared as a rose petal way, so elegant! 
I really liked the chocolate and mango flavored more than the caramel. Very smooth and tasty!
BF loved the organic chocolate and lemon. Very fresh and smooth.
We choose to sit down outside to enjoy our gelato and the perfect weather!
Of course there are inside seating area with little tables, too. 

The ordering process was a little confusing. Despite the sign hanging from the ceiling "" Line form here"", people were standing around confused.
So, first you need to decide what you want, pay for it. Then with your receipt you can proceed to the gelato counter.Tell the server what flavor you want and she will prepare your order.  That's all.

Not having a car, I relied on the transit system to get anywhere outside of the core for over 2 years.  And while the system has a few positives, it is appalling when compared to the systems you can find in smaller cities.

Let's talk about the good things first.  I have always found the buses and trains to be clean on most of my visits.  This in general is a tough thing to accomplish.  And when a bus or train isn't clean, I don't tend to blame that on Calgary Transit, as they weren't responsible for making it dirty in the first place.  But either way, they make a pretty good effort to keep everything looking nice.  Additionally, the drivers tend to be pretty friendly and knowledgeable.

But, some of the drivers also tend to be dangerous.  I've been on buses and near buses that were being driven by former race car drivers.  Sure, I'm in a rush to get to work, or get home, but I also want to be alive when I get there.  I have sat in buses while drivers have pushed the bus over 70 km/h in a 50 zone.  Scary, and not right.

The schedule and destinations for Calgary Transit is where it really fails.  I completely understand that they want to limit empty buses, but the problem there is that people won't learn to use it if it's not readily available.  They will just drive instead.  My fiance drives 10 minutes to a bus stop closer to the core and rides from there.  Why?  Because taking the bus stop closest to our house would take almost 1.5 hours to travel the same distance.  In fact, getting downtown from our house, a trip in the car lasting no more than 20 minutes, will take just over 2 hours by Calgary Transit.  You can cut that down by 10 minutes taking the train.

Taking public transportation should be convenient if it's going to be popular.  If it takes me 20 minutes to drive downtown, it should take me no more than 35-40 minutes using public transportation.

The food was very good to us. We got a cannoli for dessert - that was the one thing we will pass on next time. We got the ""large"" one to split. Trust me - not large.

It's been said that food trucks have the potential to ruin an area's restaurant culture, but based on my experience with PGH Taco Truck, an argument can be made that they can only enrich it.

PGH Taco Truck is regularly stationed in front of Lawrenceville's Espresso A  Mano 1-2 days a week, meaning it's often parked just a few blocks from where I work. After much procrastinating, I realized what a prime opportunity I had to sample what these folks are peddlin' and took a walk down on my lunch break. 

As I've said before, authenticity means little to me, and the people driving this truck seem to feel the same way. When General Tso's Chicken tacos are on a menu along with vegan options filled with curried potatoes, tradition and cultural accuracy become immaterial.

I decided to try the Local Ground Beef and Baja Fish tacos and was impressed in spite of myself. 

""Heh. Hipster tacos,"" I recall muttering under my breath when I first caught sight of that red and yellow chuckwagon months before. 

Yet, all of that pshawing was tossed under the wheels of a Volvo once I tasted that savorous, fatty, seasoned minced chuck as it intermingled with the zesty cheddar jack and tropical salsa, all of it bound in a doubled-up flour tortilla that had a delicate texture and a flavor not unlike injera, that staple of Ethiopian cuisine.

The fish taco was amply stuffed with hefty chunks of juicy cod, crema, cilantro, shredded cabbage, and lime, turning into a light lunch salad in a wrap. The crema/cilantro/lime combination became quite the tangy ranch dressing in this scenario with the cabbage adding a welcome crunch.

At $4 a taco, some may balk at PGH's prices, particularly when the same kind of portable delicacies can be had at any Las Palmas Carniceria in the metropolitan area for exactly half as much, but you won't get them with the same sense of fun, adventure, and culinary flair as you will on the highways and byways of the 'Burgh, even if Las Palmas makes mighty good ones their own flamin' selves. Track 'em down on that there Twitter and Facebook, and make good, practical use of your narcissistic social media websites. PGH's tacos may or may not be ""real"" tacos, but they are real damn good, and that's what matters most.

I used to go to Polished regularly, but then I developed a really bad nervous habit of biting my thumb nails and have been too embarrassed to get a manicure since. Two years later, I kicked the habit and wanted to treat myself. So what do you do... you go to an old faithful.

I have previously had good experiences at Polished, but my experience on Saturday was a little different. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was how worn out everything is. The walls are padded with this pleather-like material, and it just looked like it needed a good wipe-down. I also hesitated to sit in the orange seating area because it looked worn down.

Aside from that, the manicure itself was pretty good. I picked a color out of the highly organized nail polish area and was seen immediately. I was offered a glass of wine, but it was 10am so I politely declined. The manicure itself was pretty quick - a quick nail trim, file, she did a great job of cutting my cuticles and detailing the around around my nails. I didn't get gel because I'm worried it will damage my nails. It's been 4 days and my polish still looks as good as it did on Saturday. The whole thing was only $15 and it was definitely worth $15.

My only recommendation to Polished is to deep clean the sitting area and the padded walls. 

Here's a Pro Tip for Customers: They accept credit cards but can't add tips to the card transaction. All tips should be in the form of cash, so make sure you have cash.

Another HK style restaurant to add to my list.  Ming's is your typical HK style restaurant, nothing more, nothing less.

Pros:
Ample seating for a small place
Prices are good

Cons:
Portions on some items could be better

We came in for breakfast on a Saturday morning.  It was about 1000 and the place was already full.  For a small place, there's about 12 booths and a bunch of tables in the middle.  Turnover is real quick and we were seated in less than 5 minutes.  For all those seats in a small place, it doesn't have that cramped feeling you get at other small HK style cafes.  

We ordered a couple of breakfast specials.  I had a beef brisket noodle soup and a egg and ham sandwich to share with my little one.  My GF had the breakfast special which came with eggs, sausage (hot dogs), ham and toast.  Each special comes with a hot drink and you pay a little more for a cold one.  The food comes out very quick.  My noodle was very good.  It could of used a little more brisket but they gave you oodles of noodles.  The rice noodle they used was to my liking as well.  It stayed consistently al dente throughout the meal.  The sandwich was more of a miss.  The bread was rather thick, but there wasn't much inside.  It was literally one egg and a slice of ham.  For $3.99 they could of at last given me two eggs. My GF's breakfast special was not bad.  Her toast was different from the bread I got for my sandwich if anything to note.

Service here is on par with other places.  There's no glaring flaws of any sort to report.  We didn't need the third drink for our specials because our little one didn't need one so they gladly gave us a discount on one of the specials to make up for it.  Breakfast came out to just under $18 before tips.  

We had a good experience here and we'll definitely be back to try their non breakfast offerings when we can.",2015-07-22 11:18:51

I came for dinner on the patio (note: the inside is extremely loud around dinnertime - since I have a quiet voice and am not heard ~60% of the time as it is, I figured there wasn't really a choice to be made here for me!). This is definitely not the kind of place I'd take my family to as the crowd is a bit young and rowdy. The food, however, is quite nice! I don't think the portion sizes were unreasonable at all for the low price - I've had the nachos for one, the corn queso dip (?) and the warehouse mac and cheese. The latter two were definitely winners, especially the dip - delectably creamy! The nachos for one weren't outstanding but they weren't bad at all (I just felt as if there wasn't enough cheese and I was left with a lot of sad corn chips at the end :( ) but in all fairness, I've paid three times the price for a plate of nachos of a similar quality / size so I have little to complain about. You can feed yourself well here, and for a great price! I was lucky to only have to wait about ten minutes to enter, but during peak hours it might be much more difficult - I would be cautious! Be aware also that although the price is fixed at $4.95 for food options, your waiter will likely up-sell you where possible by offering different add-ons to your dishes that you will be charged an extra ~$2ish for, depending on what you choose.",2016-07-10 04:03:33

I go around Phoenix and Scottsdale and try other restaurants (e.g.: Citizen Public House, St Francis, The Mission etc) but I keep coming back to my first love (The Arrogant Butcher) ;) This is definitely in my top three favorite restaurants of all time, and my favorite American restaurant,no doubt. 

Appetizers: I LOVE their cheese and meat plate. The cherry marmalade that comes with it pairs up perfectly with the cheeses and the meat. My favorite cheese are the cypress grove and the prairie breeze (I found both of these at AJs and can't be happier). The Black mussels are my favorite as well. The butterly/garlic sauce it comes with is so so so so good. I could eat it with absolutely anything.

Entrees: I used to order the NY strip but unfortunately, they have gotten rid of it so the next best thing is the grilled ribeye. The succotash and creamy horseradish is what makes this dish AMAZING. My boyfriend always gets the burger which he said is the best burger he has ever had. I've had the jambalaya for lunch before which I thought was just okay, but maybe that's because I was never really a fan of jambalaya.

First off, it has a great relaxed atmosphere with an inviting (if sometimes way too loud) feel and comfortable seating and decor.
My guest and I decided to order different dishes for each course eat half and switch (the best way to do things!) For the first course we had a kale Caesar salad with shrimp and croutons, and a black barley and piccalilli salad. The Caesar was good and pretty standard (if a little over seasoned) except for the addition of the shrimp. This was an interesting change. The barley salad also suffered a little from intense seasoning with a 'dukkah spice' covering a layer of broccoli and cauliflower being a little too overpowering. The barley itself was light and paired well with a layer of sugar beet hummus on the bottom.
For the second course we had both a gnocchi 'fauxlognese' and a pressed pork shoulder on a bed of simmered cabbage. The fauxlognese referred to a fake bolognese sauce that used mushrooms to replace the meat. It was inventive and tasty. The mushrooms gave this sauce a taste similar, but unlike a meat sauce and it was delicious when paired with whole mushrooms in the dish, soft delicious gnocchi (with Gouda!), and spinach. However, the pork shoulder was almost a complete letdown for me. The pork shoulder itself was fine and was nice and soft for such a tough cut, but the sour and unappetizing cabbage and tomato base left me pretty uninspired. I ate some pork and after a few bites gave up on the cabbage and sort of just pushed it around on the plate.
Finally, for dessert we tried a sticky bannoffee cake and the cheesy chocolate cannoli. Unlike the previous two courses there was no disappointment here. The sticky cake was a banana bread spiced muffin covered with caramel and crème fraîche. This combination was rich, warm and homey with the crème fraîche giving it a little bite. The cannolis were also great. The chocolate filling was a little heavier that I'm used to in a cannoli, but it was tasty and rich. It was covered in a layer of chocolate sauce and peanut brittle that put this thing over the top. Intense rich stuff.
There were some pretty strong flavours through the evening, not all of them pleasant or enjoyable, but some of them great.

This morning some friends from out of town were looking for a sweet place for breakfast, and we finally decided to come here. I've only ever been to Santropol in the past for lunch (killer tomato sandwich, for the win!), so this was a new experience for me as well. Despite being very popular and highly recommended, it is still home to many locals and hasn't lost its special, unique touch. Great service too, our waiter was so nice and helpful.

Being a beautiful, sunny day, we made sure to sit in the lovely garden, amongst the flowers and the cute, little pond. We ordered the Montréalaise and Florentine, both of which were delicious. The bagels tasted fresh and were toasted to perfection, the eggs were cooked nicely, and it didn't feel very heavy. We had an iced coffee to balance out the 25 degree summer sun, while still getting a good pick-me-up made by some great, fair trade, and local coffee. 

This place is simply magical.",2012-06-09 17:56:23

Charlotte tends to have this ""hip and trendy"" factor that drives business. I'm glad Maki hasn't resorted to flashy paint schemes and marketing propaganda to lure victims. Keepin' the truck design simple, classic and cool like the OG Kogi truck and relying on their food to run their show. 

I applaud them for staying true. That's a real hipster right there. 

The downside of all that is if you're food is crap, well...

The bulgogi tacos are by far the best thing I ate. That is worth a trip to the truck. 
The bang bang shrimp though - simply sloppy and that sauce...well..can we say Thousand Island?

Spicy chicken was just that. Tasty, but nothing special. Hibachi chicken in a tortilla.

Pizza was good, but nothing to rave about.  We grabbed a cannoli to go after - it was good, but not quite the taste I'm used to having...

Since I saw the ""opening soon"" sign a few months ago, I have anxiously been waiting to try this place, and it did not disappoint! I have never been to any of the other locations (they're just too far/out of the way for me), but heard great things of course. 

The shop is fairly small, but I guess standard size by PATH standards. There is no seating inside, so it's more of a grab and go kind of place. Despite its small size though, it doesn't feel overly crowded, and it is brightly lit and fairly open so it is comfortable. They have a shelf full of their chocolate bars on the right side, macarons in the centre, and other pastries on the left. I was impressed from the start when I looked at their macarons, because they have such a large selection, probably the most of any other macaron place I've seen in Toronto so far, and some of their flavours are pretty unique! They are pretty pricey at $2.30, but I was told that there is no tax if you buy 8 or more... so of course I bought 8 (for $18.40.) In order to get them in a box you need to get at least 12 though, otherwise they will just put them in a clear little baggie for you. The staff member who helped me was quite helpful, I had a hard time picking my flavours and he was very patient with me and then gave me a few recommendations when I asked (they were all good.) I can't even remember all of the flavours I tried, but the ones that stood out to me were pistachio, matcha green tea, whiskey chocolate, rose, candy cane, and salted caramel. They were all so beautiful, and there was not a single one that I didn't enjoy. This is the way macarons are supposed to be: soft, light, fluffy, not overly sugary, DELICIOUS. There is a part of me that is kind of horrified that this place is now easily accessible, because my wallet will be bleeding on a regular basis and I am destined to become morbidly obese.

First of all, it's not the easiest place to find, even if you ARE familiar with Park Road's Backlot (as a native Charlottean, and never having had a reason to go to the Backlot, I adore this. See also: Amelie's, Midwood Smokehouse). Anyway, it's tucked away without the name advertising it's whereabouts, just their logo. I say this all as a good thing. It has this ""well known secret speakeasy"" feel to it. If this is what they were intending, they nailed it. The second I walked in, my thought was ""wow I feel like we are in Manhattan!"" Mostly dim lit, smallish and intimate tables, spanning to larger tables with better lighting. A beautiful bar. A bookcase spanning a wall, and lots of exposed brick. They nailed it.

Second of all, I was very under dressed. I joined above friend and another guy as a last minute decision and I was wearing running shoes, leggings, and a fleece jacket. Fortunately on a Thursday night at 11pm it went unnoticed as it was not super crowded. The website does make it quite clear that this is not a sports bar, and there are certain expectations (wearing my bright pink Brooks and blue fleece not on their list) of the guests to ensure a classy AF environment. I'm fine with that. We need places like that. 

Third of all, their cocktail menu is on point. The owner/mixologist takes a lot of pride in this, and it's obvious. Between the three of us, we had two rounds and 4 different cocktails and they were each delicious. We had a total of 3 Old Fashions (round 2 pour was much stronger than round 1), a Penicillin, a Hildago and a Strawberry Fizz. Like I said- all delicious. We did wait a bit for the drinks, but they are handcrafted and they don't cut corners. Worth it.

This is the first time I actually continued coming back to a particular salon despite being very reluctant because their bookings are always at least 6-8 weeks ahead (unless you're lucky enough to catch a cancellation). I discovered that Salon Chandelier is worth the wait due to their very high quality of service from the moment you're greeted at the door. I was given a personal consultation, a choice of beverages, a thorough hair shampooing and scalp massage, an expert cut/color, blow dry, and style, and all for less than $100, wow!

Charlie was very polite, listened to what I wanted, and did a fantastic job smoothing and texturing my shoulder length hair. His technique was amazing because I didn't have any color smudges after my root touchup, and my head and hair felt really clean after he finished. 

They will send reminders by text and phonecall to help you remember your scheduled appointment, and they don't have a problem with cancelling so long as you give them at least 24 hours notice. If their bookings weren't so far ahead, they'd be even more perfect!

Now that we got that situated, onward! I came to Cheffini's on possibly the worst time conceivable- on National Hot Dog Day when they were offering dollar beers from 6PM to 7PM. I arrived at 7PM, waited in line for 30 minutes, and then waited another 30 minutes for my food to arrive. The line started outside and snaked inside this tiny container. I can't fault them for their wait times or the customer service, so my review is strictly for the food. 

The deal was $5 for a Classic Cheffini with a beer. I had been wanting to try out Cheffini's for awhile but was aware of their steep prices. National Hot Dog day presented itself as the most affordable way to enjoy Cheffini's, so off I went. Plus, the local Reddit group had organized an event to take advantage of the happy hour special. 

VEGAN CHEFFINI (Normally $6.99): I got mine sans onions and mustard and skeptically opted to keep the pineapple sauce (included). Surprisingly, the pineapple sauce was one of the best parts of this dog. Ketchup, mayo, potato chips, mozzarella cheese, and jalapenos were also loaded on this vegan hotdog. The jalapenos packed an extra punch. Tasty. 4/5

SMALL FRIES ($2): Standard issue fries, but this 'small' fry was huge! Barely put a dent in it. 4/5 

Worth a Return Visit?
I really appreciate the fact that a vegan hotdog is on the menu. For $6.99 just for a hotdog though, I'm not sure how quickly I'll come back. Tasty but expensive!

The staff is always friendly, and I love the candy they give you with the bill! So yummy. They also sell the candy in zip lock bags there, but the staff did not hesitate to tell us where they bought it from (Arirang, the Korean grocery store downtown) when we asked. So kind. 

It's nice that they have a parking lot, but it feels a little bit cramped. Also, you have to be careful when you turn into the parking lot and/or when you are leaving because I think you could easily hit your bumper if you are going too fast.

I'd never been to a casino dinner buffet before so I didn't really know what to expect quality-wise. I walked around & first got a plate of their ""American BBQ"" items. They seemed very bland so I decided to try again. Meh, not much better the second time with the pizza & other small items.

I saw a lot of people at the pasta line so I figured I'd give it a shot. This time, I was satisfied. I got the lobster ravioli tossed with mushrooms in an alfredo / tomato-based sauce. It was delicious. I wish I wouldn't found this first because I probably would've just gotten two helpings of pasta! The desserts were also pretty good. There was a large variety and I tried out a few different things that I enjoyed. One of the highlights was the apple bread pudding.

Would we stop again? With as much as Las Vegas has to offer, probably not, but it's definitely a convenient/decent option if you're at the hotel anyways.",2014-10-18 19:51:47

Bisque was deeeeelicious! Huge fan! Panini looked a little bit like it had just been defrosted, flavor was ok, nothing to rave about. The pickle was, indeed, spicy! Crisp and tasty. 
Total was just over $8, not including a drink.

It's a hipster cafe located in the garden basket plaza of North East markham. It has, hands down, the coolest decor of any store in the cookie cutter plaza. Transformers art, comic book prints, abstract photos, etc adorn the walls, allowing this little cafe to make a strong first impression.  The cafe serves an asian fusion of popular HK style beverages. Their Funky Munky HK milk tea has the strong lasting flavor of traditional milk tea, with the unique texture of steamed milk found in espressos.  At only $3, I found the price to be reasonable; more expensive than a traditional HK milk tea that you'd find in a cheap asian diner, but far less than what'd you pay for a ""specialty drink"" at Starbucks.  If you're in markham and looking for a cafe to chill at that's uniquely different, check it out.

To start I had the Zig Zag cocktail which was a 5/5 for me. I loved the fresh watermelon and thought the balance of all the ingredients blended together deliciously for a very crispy, slightly sweet flavor. We then shared the spicy tuna cones (2/5) and warm crab dip (3/5). I loved the uniqueness of the cones, but they were just waaaay too salty for my liking. The crab dip was good and flavorful, but just missing that little extra something to make it a 5. The main course for us, the wagyu skirt steak, definitely a 5/5. The meat was so tender and seasoned perfectly. I couldn't get enough of the salsa verde. Absolutely amazing! The side of mashed Yukon gold potatoes were also a 5/5 for me.

Before I wax on, I would like to say kudos to the Becketts and Stephens' on their 2nd opening night!  FOH was in fine form (from the immediate greeting at the hosts' stand; to server Cort's affable personality & eagerness to please, as well as server Travis' assistance throughout the evening; and yet another server's readiness to show me to the restroom, instead of pointing the way.  (An example of four-diamond service, and I should know, since we're given the four-diamond spiel daily where I work!)  When I inquired deeper into the Legend City cocktail's ingredients, Cort offered to have Scott Stephens, the drink's inventor and BT's co-owner, come out to greet and tell me about it himself!  

As soon as I crossed the wide-open sliding-door glass panels and into the restaurant, I was in-love w/ the ambience!  It's rustic St. Francis (and a little bit of The Parlor) meets laid-back, yet mysteriously sexy Olive & Ivy.  (Think what you will about these venues' food and ambience, but I happen to love the spaces of all three!)  Really liked how I could watch what was going on in the kitchen, bar, community tables, and the main dining room w/out being subjected to too much noise.  Even the restroom door had a bit of novelty to it- go check it out and see what I mean.

Alright, so what about the food??  Where shall I start??
Let me preface by saying that I already knew what I wanted, having checked out the menu online after reading about Opening Night at BT (but I'd already eaten, darn it!), but I played along and had a look at the lovely watermarked printed menu Cort gave me.  Didn't know if I felt like  having cockails or wine yet, so I asked for the Bacon cheddar biscuits and the Mac 'n Cheese w/ pancetta, please.  Wanted to try the Legend City cocktail, but wasn't sure what ""ricard"" was (and now know, thanks to Scott!).  When Cort came back for my drink order, I asked ""the short ribs (a fave of one of the hosts'), or the osso bucco?""  W/out batting an eyelash, Cort said ""get the osso bucco; it's my favorite on the entire menu!""  Sold!  As I waited for my biscuits and macaroni dish, I spied next table's inhabitants (Hi Karen and Elsa!) breaking into their table bread, so I asked Cort if I could have some, too, please!  Looking all around me, at the hustle-bustle of the kitchen and everyone's smiling faces, I knew I was in for a treat!

The bacon cheddar biscuits were delightful!  Loved the crusty cheese topping, and I enjoyed feeling the weight of the biscuit in my hands as I tore off a piece to peer inside-- it was like I was on slow-mo' breaking bread!  (Cue in ""Six Billion Dollar Man"" bionic sound effect here.)  You must order this and smell the aroma!  It tasted heavenly, and while the apple-honey butter was tasty, its presence wasn't needed.  The complimentary bread rolls were also delicious!  Take away the biscuits and leave me the rolls, and I'd still be happy!  Don't forget to mention the mac 'n cheese!  They don't make the pastas in-house, but they are ordered in especially (""no ordinary pasta,"" said Cort).  The tasty cream sauce consisted of a blend of some of my favorite cheeses, which included asiago, fontina, manchego, and white cheddar.  Crispy pancetta on top sealed the deal.  I may just have to order this side dish every time I visit!

Next came the pork osso bucco confit.  I neglected to ask which local butcher shop the pork came from, so I can't say.  However, I will say that this dish, on the whole, was a beauty!  It came w/ butternut squash spaetzle (so pretty!) and crisp roasted veggies (golden beets, yellow squash, brussels sprouts, shallots, and perhaps leeks).  The pork confit sat atop a lovely and piquant black pepper reduction.  While I thought that the presentation could've been better (the pork itself didn't look quite finished, temp-wise, but I assure you it was!), the textures and flavor bouquets in this dish were very pleasing, indeed.

So what came next?  Could anything else impress me after all I've tried?  Ah, yes.  I ordered the Death By Chocolate, which was chocolate ganache on top of dense chocolate cake filled w/ chocolate buttercream, w/ a dusting of finely-grated chocolate on top.  Y'know, just for looks.  Jeez-louise!  Talk about killing me softly!  I've achieved transcendence.  For now.

I'll be back- thanks BT!",2010-10-29 06:53:36

Every week, my department goes out for lunch. I made the suggestion to go to Mary Brown's. I have never been to one before. The closest one to my home is in Pickering. Since this one in Mississauga is a five-minute drive away from work, it made more sense to drop by and give it a try.

It took me a number of iterations to figure out what I wanted. I cycled from a two-piece chicken combo, to the Big Mary (not me) sandwich, to the three-piece chicken combo.

When I first walked in, I noticed the small counter. There were seats, but they are limited. Luckily, we were there at noon. We had first dibs.

I also noticed that one of the middle menu screens was out. It was the menu that would have displayed the chicken tenders that I was about to order. I'm glad that I looked at the online menu before coming in.

Of course, there was a sign that said that there was a hot chicken sandwich combo (it comes with a drink) for $5.99. I love a good hot chicken sandwich, but I already had my mind set on getting the chicken fingers combo.

I placed my order. I could have swapped the taters that come with the combo for a mac and cheese salad. Instead, I wanted to experience everything. So, I got a small mac and cheese salad on the side.

The woman was friendly and asked for my name, so that she could let me know that my order was ready.

The downside going to such an establishment is that whenever someone says Mary, I turn. Ugh!

My order was finally ready. I went to fetch my order and return to the table.

The table is small for four people. We ended up giving back our trays so that we had more space to eat.

My chicken tenders were long in length. This place puts all your food into cute little boxes. As a result, some of my chicken tenders were bent and broken. It wasn't a major catastrophe, but I would be okay if they were jutting out of the box instead of stuffing them into the box.

The tenders were juicy and yummy. They weren't salted to death, which I appreciated. The downside was that I only got one little sweet and sour dipping sauce. I needed two.

The taters were okay. Frankly, I could have done without them. There were way too many that I ended up in a mild carb coma an hour after finishing my meal.

I loved the mac and cheese salad. Next time, I will substitute the taters for this salad. I need to give the coleslaw a try, as my colleague loves it.

My combo came with a canned drink. I went with a Diet Pepsi.

If you are lactose-intolerant, the chicken is dipped in buttermilk, so you may feel some of the effects. I managed to take my lactase pills before I ate, so I was okay.

This place is clean and bright, other than the dim middle menu screen.

I'd come back here to give the regular chicken combos a try. There are a number of specials, depending on when and what day you visit.

We hired a cab to take us here on the way to the train station (totally opposite direction) and wait while we went in.  No surprise, this wasn't the first time the driver received this request.  (He also received a fresh bagel for his trouble.)

Don't be misled by the (1951) in their name.  Their origins go back to 1919.  A must-visit if you're at all interested in the origins of the Montreal bagel, or Jewish culture in general.  (It's at Fairmount and St. Urbain, for goodness sake.)

That said, if I was rating on other criteria:

Service - 4.5 stars.  Another review mentioned a problem w/ coffee refills.  Mine was refilled constantly, after 2-3 sips!  Maybe because we were next to the coffee station?  Service would be 5 stars in my kids' eyes since after they cleared off (ate!) the whipped cream from their pancakes the waitress came around and asked ""need more whipped cream?""

Price - 5 stars (neglecting that the food was not great).  ""Kiddie Breakfast"" for $4 = Pancake, egg, juice, and 2 pieces of bacon or sausage!  (This would feed most adults).

First let me say that this isn't my first trip to a Dave & Buster's.  Second, I actually experience all of it while here.  We will start with the food/service.  Staff, you were wonderful.  You were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  Food, you were not wonderful.  I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts.  This came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat.  There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either.  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like (which I hoped would be the best part of the dish, I'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, I was let down. *sad face* They were cold and such a tiny portion.  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  Oh food, how if I didn't need you to survive, I wouldn't complain about you.

The building right now is in disarray.  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.

Speaking of the game room, by far the best part.  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  One good thing is the games.  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  Who knew that playing Connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter Skee Ball rises to the top of my list to play.

The least confusing place to meet was obviously Sliders as it is right outside the stadium.  This wasn't my first choice, but I wasn't going to complain in order to make it less convenient for all parties involved.

We arrived and had the door men check our IDs.  After a very large black stamp was used on my hand to indicate my over 21 status, we were seated quickly.  Because the downstairs area seemed full, we were seated upstairs.  The upstairs is an odd space- it is too open and the tables seem too small for it.  It is obvious that the space was originally designed for a more club type feel- with a raised dance floor, DJ box and long bar.  The chairs and tables are old plastic lawn chairs.

I asked what they had on draft (draft beer goes with baseball, right?) and our server informed me that the draft lines were not working because they are not open everyday.  Not sure why I needed to know that, so I had to opt for a bottled beer.  They didn't have anything fun or obscure, just the standard Miller Lite and whatnot.  

We were supposed to grab a bite to eat but no one was really felt the food on their menu seemed appetizing and almost everyone opted to wait for the game (where prices are much higher).  I, personally noticed the door guys aimlessly wandering around with people's food.  They all seemed to be dripping sweat despite the air conditioned dining area, so this made eating her much less appetizing to me.

Two people in our party did get the sliders, which they seemed happy with but that isn't something I'd eat.  

Sliders will always be busy because of their proximity to the stadium, but I'd much rather go somewhere else and get a little exercise in, as well.",2008-06-25 03:58:34

1-The menu is in Vietnamese first, English second.

2-The hostess and the waiter/chef both made small talk with me and my 3 children even though they speak very little English.

3-They asked a lot of questions to make sure we knew how odd the food we were ordering was.

4-The food literally came out in 10 minutes.  Maybe even less!

5-The restaurant, though a hole-in-the-wall was clean and inviting.

6-LOW prices and HUGE portions!

7-Prompt and friendly service.  When I asked for something, I had it in seconds.
8-Awesome sauces (hoisin, chili, etc.)

9-Did I mention really good service?

10-I guess I have to spell it out.  The food was INCREDIBLE.

We came here for our annual office Thanksgiving lunch and sat on the patio. With six different people we had the opportunity to try many different items on the menu and we were all very satisfied with our choices.

Also, we sat on the patio and it was great! There is lots of space, it's dog friendly, and there is even an outdoor fire place and couches where you could sit on a cool evening and have a very enjoyable time.

As for the food, it was excellent. I had the crispy pork belly tacos with a side of the green chili pork soup and both were excellent. The soup was flavorful and spicy, as it should be and the tacos were incredible! One of my coworkers ordered the pork belly tacos as well along with the sweet potato fries and she agreed they were great.

LVH), the annoying relatively new name of the former Las Vegas Hilton, was where my guy and I stayed for 2 nights to cap off our recent vacation to 4 National Parks.  It's not a modern or sexy hotel and casino, we knew that beforehand, but we figured LVH would be a place to stay that would save us a few bucks and still keep us relatively close (1-2 monster blocks) to the action on the Las Vegas Boulevard strip.

I'll cut to the chase:  our room was dirty.  If you appreciate any or all of the following, then Room #1116 might be just the place for you:
* peeling yellowed wallpaper
* smeared windows
* discolored and moldy grout
* corroded fixtures
* drinks rings on furniture from previous guests
* dust
* $13.99/day for WiFi
* solicitation in the form of 3 pizza place fliers slid underneath our door during the first afternoon in the room

LVH does have a few redeeming qualities, hence the 2 stars:
* proximity to the Monorail
* a few really fun and not at all politically correct blackjack dealers
* the $8 credit voucher for each day of being green (i.e., passing up maid service)

Wouldn't stay here again.  Even the decent LivingSocial deal we took advantage of didn't inspire me to turn a blind eye to our unkempt run-down room.

When I worked at PV mall I felt positively fancy to eat salad and bread sticks for lunch here.  And at $3.95 it was quite the bargain when it wasn't an official lunch menu item.  Now they've made it $5.95 for soup and salad w/ breadsticks which still isn't a bad deal.  But now of course it doesn't taste quite as good as when I thought it was healthy.

As for the other food, I was turned off when I had 2 different friends work there who specifically told me not to go there.  Well, not that it was bad or I'd get sick, but that it was to Italian food what Taco Bell was to Mexican food.  When they said that if I could microwave, I could cook at Olive Garden, I decided to trust them.  I'll admit I've been a few times with them when I'm with other folks who really really wanted to go.  The last time I went was maybe 9 months ago and what really struck me were the prices.  I can get fresh ingredients and real cooking for that price - and generally better service.  

The best thing I can say about this place is how many jobs it's given my friends over the years because they have such an amazing turn over they will hire just about anyone.  This is a great place to get a job to get server experience.  And once you've learned the art of hospitaliano, you can go get a better job.  Just like everyone else.  But it will still take at least 3 months for the smell of Olive Garden to get out of your clothes and your car.",2007-03-27 00:11:07

We had ordered the lobster meal for 4 and added one vegetable to the meal. The meal contained lobster, short ribs,  pumpkin soup, fish fillet with brocolli, and a fried rice. 

overall the meal had nothing really spectacular the best part was probably the top 1 rib. which the restaurant is named after it was pretty flavourful. however the other dishes we all agreed was either too salty, which was the snow pea with garlic. or medicore when compared to other cantonese cuisine restaurants. 

This restaurant has a nice interior and that was a great part, however they have problem when it comes to service times. The chef's were remakrably slow when coming out with the dishes, at one point we waited 20 minutes for a friend rice, which was the final dish. and each dish was so slowly cooked that they cam out one at a time and we finished before the next dish had arrived. 

The lobster was also of note not that great, it was maggie sauce lobster and was not done with any particular memorable. Many other places do it better.

Bad sign.  

There was no real desk, and I had to fumble with my purse, mittens and hat in my hand because there's no where to place anything down. The reception is crammed in the corner on a tiny little desk with a big computer monitor. The main area is hidden through heavy Ikea-eque shelving full of dust and product that looks like it's been there for ages.   I was told to go sit down. But I'd never been here before, so I didn't know where I was supposed to go. All i saw were a few high bar stool style manicure stations, with dirty & greasy looking glass on top .... 

I guess I looked confused, because the lady to who originally checked me in (later, I found out that was the owner ..?!?!!) asked me if I had been here before, and when I replied with no, she took me to the very back of the space and put me in a tiny little dark sitting area by myself. 

Hm. 
That's when I noticed the huge nicks out the wall. The drywall was literally chunked out the wall, and never patched back up. 

Now, let me preface the rest of this review, with that i had gotten a referral to this spa from a good friend who recommended the waxing services, specifically with Sonya. I really was going in with high (&positive) expectations, and really did want a great experience. After all, I was getting defuzzed for an upcoming trip and had strategically planned this appointment around my departure date. 

.... Little did I know it was a Groupon Haven of discounted spas. The first thing I noticed on my way to the washroom were the number of posters on the walls and doors advertising MORE discounted bundled '1 hour' spa packages.  They sure love discounts here; another red flag. 

I'm actually kinda shocked at what i saw. And I feel bad saying this but,  the place is run down and absolutely unsanitary and dirty.

We sat on the patio and were greeted pretty quickly and given menus. We ordered two different ipa's and looked over the menu as we waited for our beers. Once they were dropped off it took me seconds to realize this wasn't the beer I ordered and not even an ipa at that (pretty sure it was a dosxx).  When our server came back I told her about the mix up and she proceeded to smell it and tell me it was definitely the lagunitas ipa I ordered.  I told her I'm familiar with the beer I purchased and that it was definitely was not what I ordered, heck I told her to taste it. I didn't care about the mix up, but I did care about her standing there telling me I was wrong to my face.

I simply ordered another beer instead of being bitchy  about it. The food was very mediocre. I ordered a Flatbread board and it was edible but not delicious. The server was nice enough but I didn't appreciate the condescending way she dealt with things.

Long Review: We had a card for a free pizza and finally got a chance to get over there to check it out. Cute little place, very clean and everybody was really friendly. The waitress actually told me about checking in on Yelp to get a free breadsticks appetizer which I thought was very nice especially since our pizza was already free.

The chef even came out and talked to my husband for a while and seemed to be out and about in the dining area talking to people (and even refilled sodas!) which always makes me feel like they really care about what they are making, so I thought that was great. 

On to the pizza, I was worried when first going that it was going to be that flat greasy type of pizza that everyone seems to love (and I hate) but it wasn't at all. It was really poofy (for lack of a better word, lol) and the large was HUGE! It was really good, and VERY filling! Not a skimpy pizza at all, we didn't even finish half between 3 of us! I really liked the crust and everything tasted very fresh. The breadsticks were also really yummy, lots of garlic, which I love :-)

Prices are very reasonable, especially considering how filling the pizza is. A large will easily feed a family of 4, probably with leftovers. We also noticed they had a lunch special, 2 slices and a drink or 1 slice, salad and a drink, for $6 (I think) which I think is really a great price for the quality of pizza, so we are looking forward to coming in for that one day.

We are definitely glad we checked them out and I think this will be our new go to for pizza night, between the price and the quality I think they would be hard to beat!",2015-12-12 00:09:32

Fellow yelper Rica M.'s birthday celebration was pushed out, but I had been salivating over photos of this place for the whole week already. My husband and I decided to eat here anyway. Ryan was our server and he was engaging, informative, and cooked our meat perfectly! I know some reviews mention some difficulty with the quantity of food, but we really found the meal set we got for two people was more than filling and we had enough left over to go. The banchan here is slightly upgraded from the ACYE joints and they give you a soup option as well - we went with the tofu soup. The only  thing I would point out is that the tofu soup did have shellfish and seafood, which neither the menu or the servers pointed out, so those with allergies or aversions to shellfish/seafood beware. The dessert at the end of the meal was a cheesecake shaved snow cream with chocolate, which allows you to end your meal on something not so heavy. I'm not a huge meat eater, but I did like the quality of the meats we ordered and the service/cooking of these meats better than what I've had at Hobak. I also like the restaurant area and ambiance of this place a bit better, and for now, wait times are very reasonable to non-existent. 

We ended up going back with a party of 8 a week later to celebrate Rica's birthday (see Regina I.'s detailed review!). We were split into two tables of 4, which was fine. We found the larger family meal big enough for the 4 of us at our table and didn't find the need to order more meats. I was hoping Ryan could be our server again, but we ended up with someone else who was a bit busier and not as attentive (they also had to juggle our two tables and all the other parties they had though).

There are good bars, decent restaurants, a great lounge for shows, a nice pool, a great spa, and a coming soon fantastic salon (Brannon Hair is opening a location here).

Plus, you can actually afford to game here. And, oh yeah, it's just up the street from me, so there's that whole convenience thing.

The plates are small and made to share. Everything on the menu sounded fantastic, so my friends and I took our waiter's advice on which dishes to get. For three of us, we split a large paella because we were told the small was approximately the size of a small dinner plate. We also got 4 small plates. This was enough food for us to leave feeling full but not overly stuffed. Although each plate was small, every item was packed with flavour and tasted incredibly good. 

Service was quite attentive. The servers make an effort to explain each dish and also help to serve dishes such as the paella onto your plate.

It's one of our go-to restaurants when my and my husband are feeling like a bite, but don't want to go too far. I really don't understand the not-so-great reviews, because we have been here at least 6-7 times and have had really good experiences that keep us coming back. 

The ambience in the restaurant is nice - a bit dark and romantic in the evening. The tables are small, but it reminds of a bit of a crowded bistro. I also love the covered patio during the summer - it has a nice view overlooking the ROM. We normally have pretty good service and the food comes out quite fast. Sometimes our server may not be the friendliest, but the service is prompt, polite and efficient. Most importantly, we always have full drinks and the food comes out right!!!

The prime beef double cheeseburger ($19) here is, dare I say it, one of my all-time favourite burgers ever. I think it even outshines Richmond Station's burger (which is really saying something). It is a small burger in diameter, but packed with deliciousness. Two juicy patties, American cheese, very thinly sliced red onion and pickles on a fresh bun? You can't go wrong. The fries here are always on point too - they are piping hot, crisp and just delicious. I would also recommend the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich ($18). This is served with a generous piece of chicken, and a spicy adobo mayo. I have also tried the ginger steak salad, which was not particularly good. The steak was a bit chewy and the salad didn't pack the punch I expected. I guess that's what you get for trying to order a salad....

Honestly, the worst meal we had here was during Summerlicious 2017. My husband ordered off the menu, and he got the fried chicken sandwich, the duck buns and a butter tart (if I remember correctly). We have had the fried chicken sandwich before, and he said it wasn't as good. Maybe this is because of the large amount of food the restaurant is pumping out during Summerlicious? I'm not sure. Either way, we will continue coming back for the regular menu!",2017-10-17 00:35:14

I went with the clam chowder.  It was hot, tasty, and fresh.  I really liked it and my wife liked the Italian wedding.  We were off to a good start!  Then I went back for a salad.  The salad bar was clean, stocked, and cold.  Everything looked fresh, so I made myself a nice salad.  What do you know!  It was also very good.  Now we're 2 for 2 and my expectations were being set pretty high.

Plus, they serve several beers, including at least one seasonal.  They also serve a full selection of wine.  This diner is definitely above average.

My husband and I walked in, and there was a very tall gentleman in a nice suit standing by the door. He obviously worked there, as he greeted us. Security? Not sure. Got about two feet inside the door and Rachel greeted us as well. She was carrying a very large calculator as well. I thought 'well, that is different. Have never seen that before now'. I looked around and saw prices on the walls in front of different displays. She informed us that they have certain items marked down, and if we needed to know the exact price of the discounted items, to just ask. Okay, so that answers the question about the calculator. I just decided to figure it out in my head, as I didn't need to know the exact price of anything until I was ready to pay.

She asked where we were from, so we had to answer 'from here...ha ha'. Then it hit me that yes, we were still on the 'strip'. We walked about 2 feet more and were greeted by yet another employee. OMG. I just wanted to enjoy my first time inside of a MK store. The quality really was nice, and I did find some things that I would put on my wish list for birthdays and stuff like that. I really didn't need anything this time, just wanted to peruse the store. 

It seemed like they had an employee standing around every few feet, kind of high pressure. I guess this is a good sales tactic for pressuring customers to buy. You almost do feel obligated to buy something with all of their willingness to help. Kind of annoying, but I just kept looking around until I had enough.

I enjoyed the cold sushi and nigiri. The sushi chefs asked what flavor we liked and made us a fresh eel roll. It was excellent.  She is also picky with her sushi and to my amazement nearly ate all of the roll. When your wife looks up at you, smiles and says ""that hit the spot"", I know it was good.

I ordered their Smoky Bacon & Aged White Cheddar Omelette with Sautéed Onions, Rösti Potatoes and Multi-Grain Toast. The omelette was filled with gooey cheese and strips of bacon. It was delicious! The rösti potatoes were beautifully cooked as well.  We definitely did not regret our choices at all. 

Overall, the atmosphere at Moxie's was different from what I expected probably because I usually go there for dinner. It was nice and relaxing. Only downfall was where we were sitting. We were right beside the kitchen and we could see everything that was happening in the kitchen area including the two servers flirting with one another, one of the cooks yelling, employees cracking jokes at one another...it made it a little difficult for my girlfriend and I to have a conversation.

Because we had a healthcare plan we took him to Banfield in the morning but Dr. Harrigan was able to correctly pinpoint the area of concern, which later showed in X-rays. They gave him some pain meds and an injection to help him until the morning. 
It can be expensive but it's like any emergency, even if a human had to go to the ER it's a lot more for X-rays at a hospital (even with insurance).

I saw creme de violette and green chartreuse, variations of the good old fashioned (I love that I can make mine less sweet), with a handful of ice cream drinks to boot. The amaretto sour ""gone south"" was surprisingly smoky and sophisticated, and the cava colada is a refreshing, ticklish take on the piña version.

The store isn't as clean as I would like it, you find that the floors need mopping or the produce section needs some cleaning sanitizer. So I generally will clean and re clean any produce I get.

I love to read, and can easily read a book a day, more if I'm sick or it's the weekend.  But I hate the cost of new books.  That's one of the reason I love Bookman's.  

First, they have great prices on used books, and a huge selection.  There are all the bestselling authors you would expect, but also many hidden gems.  They also are very fair with trades.  I'll bring in a box or two of books, and while they are deciding which ones to buy, browse the isles.  It's very easy to get lost in there for hours, while I go through all the shelves.  Most of the books are in good to excellent condition, and by the time they have sorted my books out, I've usually managed to find enough to eat up the earned credit.  

They also have a HUGE selection of magazines, DVD's and games.  The store is well organized, but because it's a used bookstore, also like a treasure hunt.  I love to scan the shelves for that unique looking binding (Who cares if I'm judging books by their covers!?!)  There are some chairs scattered throughout the store, so you can grab a pile and dig in, to see what you really want to get.  

About the only thing I don't care for is the random crap they have - knick-knacks and paddy-whacks and random garage sale items.  Those take up space that, in my opinion, could be used for MORE BOOKS.  I'd rather buy crappy dust collectors at a regular second hand store.  They are still interesting to browse through, even if they aren't what I'm looking for.

Unlike a previous reviewer I've had nothing but good experiences at Church's Chicken here in Mesa. When it gets too late to go anyplace else and I need something to eat Church's is close and easy and fast and cheap. Not only that but it tastes good. I usually prefer dark meat but sometimes I forget to tell them and get white meat, either way it's extremely moist and tender and juicy.  I've never gotten a bad batch with an unacceptable coating or meat. 

The biscuits are so good I want to eat them like cookies! I've gotten a half gallon of the sweet tea for 2 bucks on sale in hot weather and it lasted me several days in my motel room.  I tried the Apple Turnover once and it was very good. This trip I've gotten the $2.99 special two different times that has a biscuit with 2 pieces of chicken, usually a thigh and leg but today I got a thigh and a breast.  It's a fast easy meal if it's too late to go to a restaurant and it keeps well in the motel fridge too. On past trips I've  sometimes stopped by and gotten 3 or 4 pieces just to keep in the refrigerator so that if I don't feel like going out to eat I've got something on hand.  

Oh, and I went to Popeyes a few weeks ago expecting to get a good fried chicken and it was so horribly salty I couldn't eat it. Church's Chicken has never let me down.  Even the mashed potatoes and gravy weren't bad. They certainly weren't  overly salty even though I know they were made from a mix.

I always try to get my hands on the Korean Red Bean Fish Shaped Pastries. They have a little stall near the cash registers. Made to order, so super fresh and taste the best only when fresh. It's like a red bean filled crispy waffle with a buttery taste. My all time favourite snack to get everytime I'm there.

Items I bought today:

1. Korean Crispy Fried Chicken $9.99
Their recipe is very good. I like plain Jane fried chicken. It was really crispy and super moist inside. It is also lightly seasoned, not too salty just right for my taste. Comes with a little container of pickled radish to cut the grease too.

2. Spicy Salmon Roll  $6.98
This is basically a Spicy Salmon Maki Sushi Roll. It was really good, and the heat is there, but it's ok for me because I have a high spice toleration. 

3. Herb Pork $10.98
This is very similar to a Chinese Chiu Chow Dish which is also Pork Shoulder Braised in a Sauce. It is then sliced thinly and eaten cold with condiments and rice. The Korean version is ok but I prefer the chiu chow version more, where it comes with a vinegar garlic sauce to dip the meat in.

4. Spicy & Honey Butter Chicken Combo $7.98
This dish can also be eaten cold and hot. When it's cold it's also really crispy. A tad too sweet eaten alone, but great with rice. 

5. Korean Hot Bean Paste
I usually buy this to cook with. Either I add it to a broth for a spicy undertone. Or make my own Kimchi or Bibimbap, I can add the paste in. Great to have around the house.",2016-01-24 23:58:34

You wouldn't know it from the way it looks outside, but Cantina serves up awesome food and even better drinks from south of the border.

Cantina has all you'd expect from a nicer Mexican restaurant, with a lot of the extras. You'll definitely want to order a top-shelf margarita--easily one of the best in Charlotte, if not the best.

I mostly went for the penny slots and they had a huge selection! I'm happy to say I made my money back LOL! There was only one weird thing that happened while out on the floor. My mom and I were sitting next to each other at the machines and one female employee walked past me giving me a weird look and then a few minutes later a male employee asked us if we wanted to sign up for their rewards card, he did my mom's in two seconds but then when it came to my turn he took my ID somewhere and was gone for a bit, I'm not sure if I looked so young that they wanted to card me but it was random and awkward. 

He should of just asked me flat out, and I wouldn't have had any problem showing my ID. There's a few other casinos my grandma wants to show me so I'm not sure if I'd come back on a basis.",2015-08-26 22:06:27

We ordered the Clams, Duck Confit wings and shared the Pig's Head.  Clams-- were okay, I can make them better, and they only give you 4 clams!!!  It was a little too buttery and not warm enough.  Duck Confit wings, my fiance loved,... but I thought they were too salty.  We waited a while for the Pig's Head, I didn't know it was going to take long, I wished the server would have told us earlier, but it was after the fact, after 30 min of waiting, they gave us fries since we were waiting so long.  That made us happy again!  Fries looked delicious, but I thought it was too salty.  Finally the pig head arrived and it did receive major positive attention from other guests around.  It was probably one of the best pork I've had.. its basically like eating pulled pork.. but I wished they would have gave us some type of bread to go with it, instead of making pork lettuce wraps... I would recommend them giving us some type of min buns, some bbq sauce on the side and that would have made it perfect.  We also ordered drinks, I ordered some girly martini, that tasted awful and my fiance ordered some beer on special.  Yet the beer was a cidar and the server forgot to mention it, and it was also not tasty.  We were very unhappy with our drink selections, clams,..",2011-06-15 13:26:52

I was so scared and went on yelp to review all the local vets in Las Vegas.  They were all about the same all had mix reviews.  Since I have visited Dewey adoption Center before. I had remembered that they also had a Vet across the way.  I was in a hurry to get to a Vet asap.  I found Dr. De Jesus.  I am so happy with him and he is a real personable guy who told me right away what was going on and that there were two options.  He gave me an estimate of the cost for 1. Just a biopsy to make sure it was benign or it could be cancer. Now I was scared and in the verge of tears and shaking.  He explained everything to me and I made the choice to have them removed and she had all of her left side removed.  My little Sammie was a trooper and thank God she is cancer free and she is happy and healthy. Dr. De Jesus did such a great job and her scar is almost non existent.  Please to all of you who have female dogs, get them spayed, this gives them a greater chance of not getting cyst and cancer cells.  ps they will work with you regarding cost, but It is surgery and is not cheap but my little nugget is so worth it she is like my child. 

xoxoxx to Dr De Jesus  great job.

Hope this helps all you pet lovers out there,",2014-08-02 18:10:18

I liked the decor.  

The server we had was attentive, efficient and personable, and did not hover. Small but serviceable beer list, what ever pilsner I had on draft  was fantastic, I could have had a few more but it was a school night. The house pinot noir was decent, we were never told what it was.

Ordered several small plates. We started with the duck wings with a Korean suace and kimchi(sesame bulgogi would be the best way to describe it).  The wings were tasty but small, and only 3 per order. The sauce was pretty good it tasted  Korean in my opinion. Good blend of savory,salty with a nice tang. The kimchi was serviceable, enough to  induce Kimchi breath.

The calamari and artichoke fry was pretty good, nice ratio of breading.  I like the fact it had tentacles, I mean who does not like tentacles, when talking about calamari. It was not served with any sauce which is rare, but that was OK the capers  and Korean BBQ suace from the wings did suffice.
The bacon salad with a fried egg was fantastic. Our server even split the salad. So the egg kind made the dressing not needed. The vinaigrette and honey mustard none the less were very good. Tasted like it was it was made in house. There was sufficient bacon, as you know even the rabbi said you can never have enough bacon ; )

Overall this was a  good dinning experience.",2017-03-13 01:20:45

Beware of street parking, however - there's a neighborhood relatively close at the next street over to aid your free parking search, depending on what time of day you swing by.

I arrived on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all which was perfect. We got the ube creme brulee, and an order of the ferrero rocher alongside a few drinks - matcha latte with white chocolate and a chai latte. The creme brulees were done pretty well, considering that I've never tried a ferrero rocher creme brulee! I loved every bite and wish it was bigger! The ube also wasn't too sweet, and had just the right amount of hint to it. 

Overall the place is narrow, but has some wiggle room. It's cozy, but the tables attached to the seats aren't as accomodating to the creme brulees and drinks. To me, that was the only downside. The ambiance was pretty casual and it seemed very laid back.

You have to swing by Nook Kitchen to dine on some Pizza with Pizzaz. The elaborate restaurant is inside the Hilton Garden Inn. The swanky modern entrance is a small representation of the classy feel when you walk through the door. 

My first time experience was an invite for a private party a few days ago during the early evening. I received a warm welcome from the Hostess and a man that I met later in the evening name Nick. The venue was not too pack but had a lively appeal.  Now if I could hire a designer to makeover my home I would hire the person who decorated this venue. It is AMAZING. The modern Italian look with cool vibes. The area where our party was had a unique setup. A large TV, plenty of seating, dim lighting and candles. Perfect area to hold that would hold a small group of friends while they enjoy themselves. The main area had tables perfectly positioned where you did not feel cramped and could enjoy your food. There was a large long table that with unique chairs that seem to be entertaining a business group who truly enjoyed themselves. The bar was defiantly entertaining. You can tell the bar has a nice night life. Lastly the patio area was beautiful. As the venue is located on the corner you get to watch the downtown life while you dine.

Now to the good stuff. The food and drinks! What I like about the menu it is not overwhelming. There is the perfect variety for all types of taste buds. Along with a pleasing drink menu.

Our group started off with a variety of appetizers. I did not eat them personally however, the table did and they gobbled them right up. We ordered Burchettas, The Classic Caprase and Beer Braised Pork Butt. We split the NEW WORLD MARGHERITA and the PROSCIUTTO. The pizza was not only fresh but extremely tasty.

We had a group of 8 at Cantina Laredo for happy hour and we had a great time!  The happy hour menu is quite large, half off the regular price (equaling around $4-6), and some of the items are quite unique.  

I had the Steak Fajita Flat-bread and the Ceviche.  The Flat-bread was outstanding and perfectly crispy!  I loved the taste of the caramelized onions with the steak marinade!    I was not a big fan of the ceviche. It only came with two 'fancy chips' to scoop up the ceviche and there was a ton left, so after that I had to use the tortilla chips that came to the table earlier.  It also had olives in it, which I thought did not taste well with the fishy taste.  

I also had a HUGE margarita for only $5!  It wasn't the best I have ever had, but for $5 I would drink it again! 

Many in our group ordered taco plates to share.  The plates come with 3 decent sized tacos; they all tasted good, but some were more exciting that others (one set was pretty bland). 

At the end our server brought out a dessert platter!  We almost ordered all of them (4), but instead we opted for the apple, chocolate and pineapple desserts to share for the whole table.   We all decided the chocolate and apple deserts were the best and came on a sizzling plate of caramel with melting icecream on them.  I highly recommend either of those desserts; they were quite impressive to look at and eat (see picture)!

Our server was just okay.  We had to repeatedly ask for a few things and we waited quite a while after we ordered.  But, he was busy and we were a big group.  He did however, split up our check very efficiently, which seems like a burden for most places!

The atmosphere is pleasant, warm and inviting.  It definitely qualifies as a 'fancy' Mexican restaurant.  I will definitely come back, and I am excited to try more things off the extensive menu!",2013-01-17 17:14:12
-PAtexxBsTbMnoxY3969Fw,djpMXOA1ic5wv3FPtubHNw,sHXIiGercy22UVpwMMmYng,2,3,2,1,"I suppose places like Milestone's fill a unavoidable yet tacky niche in the dinning landscape: high end casual fine dining. And yet it works for the most part. It's reliable and comforting choice for groups of people, tourists and suburbanites and generally anyone looking to play it safe in a lively, stylish decorated area. There are plenty of girly and non girly drinks abound here to keep anyone interested in having a good time entertained and the loud music or the front patio is nice if you're in for some people watching in the entertainment district. 

That being said, mains and drinks are priced almost close to what you could get at a local fine dining/bistro type place with more creativity and freshness taken into account for the dishes. Take the artichoke dip at Milestone's for example, tasty yes but at $10.99 it's a little hard to take especially when it seems that it mostly likely given a zap before arriving at the table. Or the pastas which of ginormous size and generally palatable but when basil and roma tomatoes are promised and one receives sun dried tomatoes and cilantro (wtf?) slight irritation ensues.

Anywhoo. Milestone's is not the antichrist when it comes to great food because it's somewhat consistent and you know that you can come here in a group and manage to please most everyone with the safe menu.

We had shared a salad and pasta penne dish.  The salad popped with flavor and was surprisingly good.  The penne was also pretty good in a zesty red sauce.  When it comes to past I just expect something near perfect and anything less is... well a letdown.

For hungry shoppers there is the food court with it's variety of fast food items, while there is Cheesecake Factory and Maggiano's in the front of the mall and there's tons of options for dining around the mall as well.

I've been a regular member here for about two years and even though it is a little out of my way, I often make this my workout destination because I love the pool access. It's open almost any hour and usually not too crowded. I've done the aqua fitness class several times and it was a great workout. Usually I just do laps or kick sets on my own. I find community pools are very restrictive in their hours. Great that I can pop in here when it's convenient for me.

I also bought passes to the hot yoga class for a very reasonable cost. The class is challenging but appropriate for all levels.

 The free weight section is a bit lacking. There is usually not a free bench or enough of the 10-20 range of dumbbells. I do like the workout room with the matted floor. It has a variety of good equipment like kettle bells, medicine balls, bands and dumbbells so you can set up your own circuit.

The cardio equipment is at the back. I find this area a little claustrophobic for some reason. You feel kind of jammed in like sardines. I usually opt to do runs outdoors in this area as there are a few really nice trails close by.

This Goodlife location has one of the biggest change rooms I've seen. There are many full size lockers in addition to the usual half lockers. If I'm doing a swim plus a floor workout, it's nice to have the extra storage space for all my gear.

But at Food Truck Friday last week, I decided to mix it up from my normal Short Leash and try Jamburritos again. I'm glad I did.

I had the Steak K-Sadilla. I can't believe this thing is only $7. It's huge! I hadn't eaten breakfast and was starving. Not only did it fill me up, but it kept me full until dinner. It was super flavorful and the side of cajun sour cream was the perfect accompaniment. The only thing I didn't like is it was a little too messy. Although I appreciate the healthy serving size, I almost wish they put just a little less in the K-Sadilla so I could actually pick it up and eat it, instead of having to use a fork.

The only thing that is keeping me from giving Jamburritos 5 stars is the wait time. I know FTF gets busy, but the cashier quoted me 11-13 minutes, and it ended up being almost 20. I feel like one of the cool things about food trucks is it is quick. If I have to wait as long as I would at a restaurant, it kind of takes away from the experience.",2013-03-28 18:52:02

It has the appearance of a pound cake, feels light like angel food cake, spongy fluffy texture, and has that nice egg-y smell/taste to it.

Nonethless, I am giving this place a 4 star for the food, not dim sum cause I have not tried it.  I have eaten inside the restaurant area and outside in the food court area.  Decent selection.  Good food.  Especially of note is their roast and bbq items, like bbq pork and roast pork.  Both are excellent and done right.  Trust me, if you go to Best HK or buy them from Lee Lee, they will give u fatty bbq pork sliced very roughly in huge chunk.  Its not the way that should be served as the taste of a giant chunk of pork is a little overpowering especially if you have the bbq sauce flavor.

My buddy who came to visit from Colorado loves their roast duck so much, he went there on the last 3 days of his visit.  His main complain was why I did not bring him there earlier in the week ?

So U know, come here expecting seafood well prepared ,wok dishes cantonese style, cantonese/hk style bbq and U will have a good meal.

Our party of 9 came here for brunch since it was convenient and I liked my dinner experience here. Our group ordered a multitude of items: croque madame, 3 egg omelette, spinach quiche, salmon baguette, sausage,  and chicken and waffles. The croque madame was definitely the winner - over easy eggs with melted cheese on top of a brioche, sandwiched in between was layers of ham. Came with fries and it was SO DELICIOUS! The other winner was the spinach quiche. 

So towards the middle of our meal, we see the table next to us have the head pastry chef come out and present them with this dessert concotion (SECRET!). We knew it wasn't on the menu and knew that the table knew the chef somehow, but we requested from our waiter if we could possible order that dessert. The waiter said he wasn't sure but would ask the chef for us.

5 minutes later, the waiter, ""I'm sorry, the chef isn't able to make you that since it take a day to make, but he wanted to send out complimentary rasberry ice cream popsicles"". Imagine our excitement as these were vanilla ice cream popsicles NOT on the menu with rasberry filling. HOW LUCKY were we with this free dessert?!

1 minute later, the chef himself walks out and presents us with the dessert concotion and says, ""Next time you're here, just let me know and I'll make these for you."" SO EXCITED! We took pictures with him and shook his hand for his generosity.

30 seconds later as we were excitedly commending our good luck since we got 2 free desserts, 2 busboys come out with 3 creme brulees, compliments of the chef. WTF?! ARE YOU KIDDING?! :)

1 spoon into the creme brulee, we're presented with the Mousse au Chocolat Noir (dark chocolate mousse) and the Pot de Creme (infused custard). OMGOMG we are freaking out.

Halfway into the mousses, a waiter comes out with the Creme Glacee/ Sorbet Aux fruits (3 different types of sorbets) - the lemon sorbet was DELICIOUS!), AND the Profiteroles (vanilla ice cream & chocolate sauce, which had this breadlike thing on top of the vanilla) and the waiter had to pour the chocolate sauce for us. We were ESCTATIC!

LITERALLY 10 seconds later, another busboy (who has sensed that I was the MOST excited out of everyone, or perhaps I was just the loudest), put next to me, the Tarte au Citron (lemon tart), and a flan. By this time, I have NO IDEA what to eat and am confused as to what I tasted.

The last dessert that they gave us, was the Ile Flottante (meringue with vanilla creme anglaise). This was the only dish I didn't like because it was a creme that was very light...sort of the cappucino creme, that didn't appeal to me so much.

Bill came with no charges to ANY of the desserts. BEST DAY OF MY LIFE! THANK YOU PASTRY CHEF CHRIS HERRIN for making a group of 25 year olds have one of the greatest memories of their lives. :)",2010-07-25 20:44:31

Since I am in the Strip almost every day, the Market Outlet is my go-to for all my produce needs.

The store is broken up into an indoor and outdoor section that is easy to walk through. The produce is outside while the inside has more non-perishable items and some odds and ends at a discounted price. Goods inside are sometimes past or near the expiration date and sold for less than you'd find at your local grocery store. I can understand not wanting items you'd worry about getting a bellyache from, but I don't know what harm can be caused by pasta or granola bars past their listed date. My boyfriend and I like to save money, so we frequently buy snacks and miscellaneous things like paper plates, spices, and foil pans here.

Produce shopping is one my favorite things to do on my lunch break. Gotta make wise use of an hour break, and what better way to do so in the Strip? They always have some kind of amazing deal and occasionally some unique fruits and veggies. I've seen blood oranges, prickly pears, and persimmons here before, and even some Italian eggplant that looks kind of funny at first.

Came here for the first time last night and got:

Dumpling appetizer
Mongolian beef
Hunana pork
Strawberry cheesecake
Durian ice cream

Dumpling appetizer is basically gyoza. Nothing crazy going on there, but they were cooked to perfection. It's easy to get these babies undercooked and overcooked.

Mongolian beef and Hunana pork entrees were both prepared with a seitan based fake meat. Both are spicy. We ordered a 7 on the spice level, and I would say it was still mild. The sauces were really flavorful. My only suggestion about these dishes would be to cook the bell peppers a little longer. They were basically raw, which just kinda brought the consistency of the dish down.

Strawberry cheesecake was AMAZING. Better than my own, which I considered the bomb...but no longer. Same with the Durian ice cream. It's nice to see an exotic offering on the menu. Durian is a great tasting fruit, but a lot of people are put off by it because of its infamy. 

Bathrooms could use a little update. There was old ceiling panels propped up against the side of the women's bathroom, which was odd, but I'm guessing they may have recently done some repairs. 

Have to come back for the vegan sushi! Our waitress was urging us to get some, but we passed because of my love for seitan.",2018-08-09 17:11:31

My wife had a coworker who said it was good but as much for the summertime, sand in the toes on the lake part as for anything else.

Our experience was a combination of hits and misses that left us thinking, it's ok and we may give the place another shot come spring/summer.  Here's the rundown...  

We started with a crab toast appetizer which was tasty but some of the crostini were burned, some were under-toasted and one was just right.  The cheese on top was just meh and had been melted and then left to sit and harden a bit too much before serving. 

The wedge salad was fresh iceberg, with bacon and diced tomatoes served on a chilled plate with some very good blue cheese dressing.  It wasn't perfect though as the menu said served with crispy onion straws and there were none to be found.  My wife had a house salad which was mixed greens with some too sweet pomegranate/orange vinaigrette.  

For entrees, I had the lobster and shrimp roll which was served, as it should be, in butter toasted split-top rolls.  The two rolls were packed with filling (more shrimp than lobster) that was dressed nicely and topped with arugula.  I asked for no fried capers but they arrived covered in them which was a bit of a pain.  My wife had spaghettini with a giant meatball in the middle.  She loved that the pasta was fresh made and the meatball was good.  She would have preferred more sauce but overall, it was good.

That's it on the food side.  Generally good but not great and we definitely liked all the variety on the menu and feel that is a plus that would help us come back.  It also may lead to the good not great on some of the food though.  It's hard for a place to get so many things just right.

The service was definitely friendly, a bit overbearing and on the hard sell side and without full grasp of the menu items (see above paragraph for a possible cause).  I don't need to hear a full rundown of 3 of the 8 or so apps, just pick one and be done.  Also, the tables where we sat are VERY close together so when he would stand between them his crotch was almost on the edge of our table and his butt on the table behind.  Thankfully, there was nobody sitting to the butt side. Just a little off-putting.

A longish review, I know but there was so much variation that it felt warranted.  Like I said, we will surely go back but, truth be told, if the meal was exactly the same in all these aspects, the second visit would likely be the last.  Too many other great and consistent options to risk $$ on good/great/inconsistent.",2014-12-09 14:49:36

The counter area that looks more like deli then Chinese restaurant. Outside of the counter area is nice got aquarium, couple artwork along the walls, one wide screen tv, and overall pleasant atmosphere dine in. 

The menu is pretty straight forward I feel with typical Chinese menu nothing really exotic or out of the box. The lunch specials is normal you get egg roll, egg drop soup, drink, and choice of entree. Fried rice or white rice. All for bargain under ten dollars. I ended up going with the Chicken with Mixed Vegetables. I really enjoyed!! There was nice amount of chicken and the best part is tons of vegetables all cooked perfect al dente plus nice mixture. There been times had other Chinese lunch specials that mixed vegetables only one or two different ones. Here you get wide range from bell peppers, carrots, celery, and more. The sauce is solid. Overall nice portion even the rice not small perfect little scoop but full one. Not sure about the rest of the menu if the Chicken with Vegetables is any indication there lot more of the menu on my radar...

The first and only time I've come here, was to play Bingo. That statement alone should be enough evidence to myself and anyone else who will listen that my days of coolness have passed. If they ever existed at all.

This place is pretty sweet. I had dinner before Bingo because grandpa (me) knew it might be a late night and I didn't want to eat after I left here. Doing something like that would lead to a night of indigestion and no sleep. Psssh... who needs that in their life. Am I right? 

I tried the carne asada quesadilla and it was unexpectedly good. I would eat here again without a doubt. 

The Bingo was played in the concert area. I'm not gonna lie... it was fun. The event was put on by Jackalope Ranch and emceed by the National Comedy Theater of Phoenix. They did a great job. Funny people. Especially this guy Marcus. Hilarious.
 
They were all about audience participation. Like it or not. I was actually glad I never won a hand of Bingo because then you had to go up on stage and try to match wits with a trained comedian. I don't need that in my life. I'm the kind of person who thinks of a comeback 3 days later. It was a lot of fun though.

45 minutes after time of arrival:  dammit.  forgot to take pictures.

so folks, no pictures of three pretty good pizzas we ordered.  we got one pizza that was called the margherita americana which was mozzarella, basil, tomato sauce.  the next was called the polpettino which was small meatballs the size of small gobstoppers or maltesers, some basil, mozzarella and tomato sauce.  finally, there was the funghi with crimini mushrooms, taleggio, sage and truffle oil.  

they were all very thin dough with great consistency which i love and simple.  the truffle oil was awesome.  the tomato sauce was quite tangy, the basil refreshing AND WE HAVE LEFTOVERS.  (nothing better than pizza for leftovers.)

the two salads we got were a caprese and an arugala with beets and goat cheese.  those were AWESOME, especially the bufala mozzarella in the caprese, so soft and fluffy.

overall i thought the food was quite tasty, but not necessarily worth spending the seventy dollars we spent on it.  at the same time, i was sated so perhaps the crux of it there and it was worth it.

Guys in muscle tees, dropping their weights, chugging their protein shakes. I once put a weight down at a bench and then went to go get another one and one of them took my bench I was obviously using.

If you avoid this place around their busy times it not bad for what you pay for.",2016-02-06 16:01:48

I came in again with my friend, and we both ordered tsoynami. They made his first, then a bunch of other people- nearly 19 minutes later mine was ready. My friend tried to wait to eat his, but it was melting. So, by the time I had mine- I was eating alone. It really didn't make sense. 

Conclusion- a vegan restaurant should really know what's in the food. Many people adopt this lifestyle because of food allergies and various other concerns. Improve workflow and service. Right now you are below standard, but you have the potential to be great.",2016-09-11 11:46:46

The reason I say this is I am looking at this through the lense of being at a jammed packed bar that is trying to handle people who roam around and order food and drinks at a rapid pace.

That said they handle the events as well as any bar I have ever seen if not better. Service is usually prompt and polite with drinks getting refreshed when needed. The food is not spectacular but it is pretty solid. Somewhat disappointed to see that this year they have cut down the menu to a game day specific short list. It still has some good stuff but I liked having all the options. I am guessing it was tough to get things out quickly that way although I usually thought times matched what I expected based on how busy they were.

After like 2-3 samples there look at you and start giving u that look of ""are u going to buy anything?"". But this place was totally different! They want you to sample everything so that u can get a feel of what u really enjoy! 

I asked for all of the spicy ones and the ones they gave were pretty yummy but not very spicy. Then they offered me El Diablo which omg so delicious. It has a nice kick and the flavor was well balanced. It was not bagged or on display... They said that they keep it in the back because it is so spicy. It has ghost chili in it but I have to say it was my all time favorite!!! :)

I got their special...4 bags+ 1 fruit or 1 juice for $30. I got 2 bags of the el Diablo which they packaged up for me and I got the general tso's (and yes it did taste like general tso's!!!!!Yummy!) And 1 bag of the spicy garlic... u could totally taste the garlic. So good!!

It's not that close to my house but I definitely will be back. From all the beef jerky that I've tried here in Vegas... This is by far my favorite.

But when you order a $12 appetizer and you get like 2 duck tacos to share amongst your table of white collar professionals who are aghast at the appetizer pricing you know something is wrong.  Love the flavor of said duck tacos.  Love the flavor of his tamales.  The masa is just so flavorful!  Unlike any tamale I've had.

But still....even with a nice steak.  The meal just is too expensive for what you get.  This is coming from someone  who has spent $400 for a meal and been happy to do so.

Texas Toast Blackened Catfish Sandwich
That day, they didn't have anymore fried catfish.  I almost said nevermind, but I'm so glad I didn't.  The sandwich was huge, I could only handle half.  It was a while ago so I can't remember everything on it, but their cajun sauce i definitely remember.  The sauce and the blackened fish meshed so well, along with the toasty texas toast.  It was flawless.  I can only imagine how much more I might have liked the fried fish.  I'd recommend this to anyone.

Fried catfish k-tacos
If someone had told me I'd wake up that morning and have a perfect meal, I'd say...'why are you talking to me this early'.  The catfish was flawless (there's that word again).  Fried like my own grandmother was in that truck doing the cooking.  I haven't had catfish seasoned and fried this well since her.  A better job could not have been done here.  Every single thing on these tacos was awesome.  And again, their white cajun tartar sauce walks hand in hand with this fish.  The best catfish I've had outside of my grandma's, and the best fish tacos I've had period.

The first time I had food from this truck was at a farmer's market.  The wait was a bit because the line was quite long.  Second time, same thing.  I'm not a frequent food truck customer, so I'm not sure what an average wait time should be.  However, I did not mind the wait because of the kind of food they were pumping out of there.  I mean, you're serving up platters of freshly fried and perfect catfish.  You can take a while.  I don't mind.

I was prepared not to like this place because it seemed to be to hip and trendy for me.  I don't really care what a place looks like as long as it is clean, well maintained and serves good food.  I went to Cantina 1511 on a Saturday for lunch.  It was a cold, rainy day but the parking lot was pretty full.  Since I was by myself the hostess asked if I wanted to sit in the bar area and that was fine with me.  They had high top tables and leather couches to sit on.  I grabbed a seat on one of the couches as it was near the TV and I could watch some football while I ate.  I thought the couch might be a problem when it came to eating, but it really wasn't an issue.  The waitress came over shortly after I was seated, dropped off a menu and took my drink order.  I order a Dos Equis Amber, which I recently discovered is an outstanding beer.  She gave a few moments while she got my beer and some chips & salsa.  The menu is pretty simple with traditional & tex-mex version of the standard Mexican fare.  I ordered three tacos from the traditional menu, al pastor, carnitas Johnny, and carne asada.  I sipped my beer and watched the game.  My food came out pretty fast.  The presentation was very nice and the portions size was good.  I tried the carne asada taco first.  It was delicious.  The flavor of the steak was excellent and it was very juicy.  I really couldn't tell you what other garnish was on the taco, because I was concentrating on the flavor of the meat.  I'm pretty sure there was some sauteed onion and peppers which complimented the meat well.  Next I tried the carnintas taco.  It was also delicious.  The flavor of the pork was great and it was very juicy.  Last was the taco al pastor.  Slow cooked pork with shredded cabbage, roasted pineapple, habanero crema and fresh cilantro.  I thought the combination of the pork and pineapple would be interesting and it was.  This taco was good, but didn't quite do it for me.  I'd probably double up on the carne asada or carnitas next time.  The plate came with tortilla slaw, vegetable rice and beans.  The sides were all pretty good and a nice compliment to the meal.  To me Cantina 1511 seems to be a hip, trendy place, but I'm a middle aged fat guy. I was very skeptical and prepared to not like it, but Cantina 1511 serves some very good food.  The service was excellent and the prices were very reasonable.  I learned my lesson here, don't judge a restaurant by it's trendiness, judge it by the food it serves.  And for Cantina 1511 it serves some very tasty food.",2010-12-06 14:11:31

I've been coming to Jun's for many many years, but this is my first review of it.  I enjoy the bonchons that this place offers.  I think E-Jo has the best Kim Chee, so if you want that, go there.  Hobak is the best for BBQ, but if you want fast, casual Korean food, this is an excellent place.  I generally just order the chicken, but have also ordered the Kalbi from time to time (disclosure - not the best, but it is good.  E-Jo's is better.).

In case you are reading this and aren't a frozen yogurt regular. Yogurtland follows the similar concepts many other places have. You self serve your yogurt, add the toppings, and the price is based on weight. 

With that said, The toppings Yogurtland offers aren't as diverse as your Mojo yogurt, but the fruit is always fresh and there is a good variety. Where yogurtland wins hands down is with the yogurt flavors.

They always have some seasonal passport game going on where every 2 weeks they introduce new flavors for a limited time, and these are usually better than the regulars! My favorites are, pistacho, cocunut, strawberry lemonade, and vanilla.

Not particularly by choice, but my mom worked there and irresponsibly (love ya mom!) brought home those lovely grease filled, cheese and meat covered circles of dough to my family nearly every other day.   Anytime I was hungry, Pizza Hut pizza was waiting for me in the fridge and I developed a dependency to my pan pizza friends.  Fast forward 20 something years and Pizza Hut was still my pie of choice over Dominos, Papa John's, etc.  I dug Metro Pizza, CPK, and others, but not until I had Grimaldi's did the wool finally get pulled from my eyes.

(begin food review)

OH THE CRUST!   I'd never had authentic NY pizza prior to Grimaldis (I'm sure there's some New Yorker reading this right now shaking their head due to their belief of what real NY Pizza is.   To them I say:  no one cares).   Once you go coal blackened, you never go back.   Every pizza I've had since has paled in comparison (here's looking at you Settebello).   I like every type of pizza you can get here.  The Regular with some Pepperoni is simple and delicious.  The White with Garlic and Anchovies.  The Pesto.  no, THE PESTO.  My absolute favorite.  Pesto with Pepperoni and Meatball with some jalapenos on the side.  Absolute perfection.   I typically eat the Eastern location which I find the most consistently good, though I did try the Fashion Show one a few nights ago and found it just as good on that one visit.  Ingredients tasted fresh, crust was that perfect nearly chewy texture.  Several calories were devoured that night.

One other shout out: the bartender that was working that night was fantastic.  I sat at the bar for about half an hour waiting for a friend and he made one of the best double jack and cokes I'd had in a while.  I had several throughout the night (note to reader: this may or may not have influenced my food review).   I dont remember his name, but the next time you're in the Fashion Show and need a buzz before you get lost in the 20 floors of Forever 21, swing by Grimaldis with $10.50.",2012-06-12 05:29:37

Anywho, I ordered a goat cheese pizza with a gluten-free crust.

(TUF guy or gal- Lover of all things TRUFFLE, UNI, AND FOIE GRAS...;)  The Lamb Ragout with Udon was another winner, and  portions were perfect considering the price point, quality of ingredients used, and the caliber of chefs in the kitchen. Great to see Chefs Brian Howard and Justin Kingsley Hall (SLO-Boy) back in action! Great first visit,  and most certainly not the last! Gotta make it back for that 11pm Burger du Jour, and it would be cool to perhaps one day revisit some of SLO-Boy's
signature items as well....that Griddled Bread Pudding though! If you know, you know...ALOHA!!!

Let it be known that I am no Vegas hotel snob.  I don't expect to stay at the Wynn or the Bellagio every trip to Vegas and I'm perfectly okay with Stratosphere, Excalibur, or any other middle-of-the-line choices.  My boyfriend and I stayed at the Flamingo for a friend's military graduation ceremony that was taking place in one of the convention rooms this past weekend.  The rate was military discounted, so we took it.  The convention room itself was nice, the food was decent.  The location on the strip is also a plus for the Flamingo.

But...the hotel rooms themselves were outdated, cheesy, and not impressive to say the least. Granted, I should say that we stayed in the older part of the hotel, and not one of the updated or renovated rooms- judging from the pictures that other Yelpers have posted, the new rooms look a helluva lot better than the old ones we saw (friend's suite) and stayed in.

We stayed on the 27th floor ""Executive Floor"" as the guy at the desk told us.  I knew that the Flamingo had been sitting on the strip since forever, so I was expecting an older, not-that-bougie hotel, even though we were supposed to be staying on the nicer floors.  Even at that, I was disappointed when we saw our room.   In short, the room could be described as drab, confusing, and almost depressing.  Like a senior citizen home, or something.  Like they tried to make the room look good with decor that had no common theme or common sense whatsoever.

 There was a large, sketch-looking stain on the side of the bed, and the bathroom....don't get me started.  It needed serious renovation- there was paint chipping off  the walls and a dirty-looking mustard yellow (hello, 1975) shower curtain that stuck to the railing at the top.  The water pressure was weaker than a faucet in a kitchen sink and the lighting was dim and...did I already mention the word depressing?  The bath towels were HALF the size of the towels we have at home, and we bought our cheap bath towels from Burlington Coat Factory.  Need I say more?

I know, it sounds harsh.  But it's all true.  I wished we had stayed in the updated, renovated rooms- maybe our experience would have been better.  The casino itself is alright, Margaritaville looked fun but we didn't drink there, and the pool looked pretty cool too, although jam packed with people (what can you expect in June, though).  The bar called Sin City Brewery, inside the Flamingo near the pool area, was really good.  Their light beer was yummers!  But that's for a separate review.

Ultimately, this is VEGAS, I get it- where getting drunk to get drunk is totally okay, if not encouraged.  I'm down!  But i shouldn't need to get drunk just to escape the depression that echoes off the walls of our ""Executive"" hotel room.  For real.",2009-06-15 17:06:31

I ended up getting the usual and my friend just wanted an order of fries.

The burrito looked better on the advertisement than in reality. Had a few shrimp but was expecting a few more.

I'm happy Brew expanded to Henderson and we now also have a legit spot for tea , coffee & boba. If I went to any other place it's because it's passed 10 pm & I'm craving tea but Brew is closed. 

What makes Brew way better than other places like in Chinatown or southwest side is that their drinks aren't too overwhelmingly sweet , you can actually taste the tea. They have an extensive tea selection here. If you don't like your drink you can always get it adjusted to your liking or switch it out to a different drink at no extra charge. I recommend getting their mate or oolong tea (high mountain) with light sea salt cream if you want something refreshing. For something on the sweeter side , I recommend their earl grey milk tea or ""hoki-oki"" (combination of their milk candy flavored hokkaido & brown sugar black tea okinawa) w/ boba , egg custard or both as toppings. They also serve crepes here - if you order a crepe here on your birthday they put a candle on it and the Brew crew comes to your table & sings happy birthday to you.

Loving the new interior & layout at their new location too - they have upgraded a lot and added small details which makes a big difference such as more charging outlets (people w/ iPhones you understand the struggle).

I'll start off with what we liked. The location is prime with its proximity to Yonge-Dundas Square, Dundas station, Eaton Centre, Ed Mirvish theatre, and plenty of eateries. The room was clean, the bed comfy, and it was priced very well for where we were. If you're going to do a lot of exploring of the city and won't be spending much time in your room, then this would be an ideal place to stay.

However, I'm not inclined to stay here again. The customer service is hit and miss. The check-in process was unsatisfactory. She asked me for a credit card as they usually do and that was about it. She didn't mention the room number at all. On the bright side, I can read and so I found it written on the cover of the key card. But she failed to mention anything. I later had to call down and ask about parking and wifi. Which leads me to my second complaint, how is wifi not included? We paid about $10 for wifi when almost all other hotels have it.

Our reservation was for 7p and they were ready for us with a big table toward the back (I definitely recommend sitting as far from the front as possible - the open ""windows"" to the casino mean you see and hear all the casino noise and smell the cigarettes.)

I think Asian fusion is overrated to begin with, so I didn't find this place any better or worse than a PF Chang's or Bamboo Club, food-wise. The prices were on par with both those chains, and their offerings similar as well. I wasn't starving so shared the Ahi lettuce wraps and fried wontons (with real crab) with a friend. The wontons were excellent, not too greasy with a good balance of cheese and crab inside and wonderful sauce drizzled outside. The Ahi wraps were nothing special, in fact I found the filling to be nearly flavorless. Everyone else at the table was incredibly happy with their entrees - that included the meatloaf sliders, evil jungle princess (yes, she totally ordered it just for the name), and the sizzling salmon and asparagus to name a few. Aesthetically speaking, the sizzling salmon looked absolutely incredible and the perfect serving size.  

Serving our large party went off without a hitch, and that is worth three stars alone. There wasn't a single order missed, late, lukewarm or wrong. Though we did have a mysterious order of chicken lettuce wraps show up randomly. I never had to crane my neck to flag someone down for another drink (again, really hard to pull off with a large party), and from the hostess to the server to the manager (who came by to help out and drop off a few items) were cool and genuine. And big points for asking us up front if we all wanted separate checks to avoid awkwardness/confusion at the end of the meal.

1) The cheese counter - the only other places that can compare is wholefoods and natures emporium
2) The hot/cold table - so many options, it's unbelievable. Tack on to that, it's the cheapest i've ever seen. Finish it off with really delicious. Well worth it.
3) I love pickles. They have aisles of pickled everything.
4) I love quality honey. They have half an aisle of honey, all high quality and good prices.
5) I love chocolate. They have a giant selection of imported chocolate, mainly from europe, but also from around the world. Best part beyond depth of product selection - prices. priced perfectly. 
6) Produce: The organic selection is respectable and they have green tags that mark anything that is organic. Saves a lot of time and helps picking out products that much better.

I liked my Orange Chicken lunch meal as it came with fried rice, spring roll, salad and plenty of oragne chicken. The soup was ok too.

The food was good, but not spectacular - a solid base to start with though.  We sampled the breads and spreads.  I really liked some of it and didn't love some of it. The black garlic was a lot more bitter than I'd anticipated and the raisin bread was sort of stale, but there was a goat cheese spread and a sweet potato spread that I could have eaten a vat of.

The first goal I wanted to accomplish was a swanky new storm / screen door so off to Lowes I went and ordered the nicest one they had as well as their installation service totaling $505. I didn't hate the price because to me it was worth $505 to finally have my door. 

I took half a day off work on my installation day and two men from GR Stevens (installation sub-contracted by lowes) arrived to my house. They weren't particularly friendly or communicative, but I assumed that was just the way blue collar boys are... Remember, I'm a new home owner and very new to home repair, so not exactly sure what to expect. I asked them what they needed me to do and was told to keep the door open and unlocked, so that's what I did. I wanted to feed them but they refused any food so that was that. 

When they were finished the door was in place and it worked perfectly... but it looks bad on the inside and the outside. I was honestly shocked at how bad my door now looks with all the money spent. I wondered why my door didn't turn out looking normal like everyone else's door does but they assured me that it was my shotty framing and excess caulking from a previous weird door installation that was why they left it looking the way it does. I now need to have a handy man come over and do whatever to make it look normal.  Being a new homeowner with no blue collar guys in my life to ask, I really wasn't sure if I was getting the truth so needed some help from Lowe's customer service team.  After many back and forth conversations with Lowe's Installation Customer Service and sending of pictures I was told that the installation was done correctly and that the issues were in fact my door frame.  This wasn't the answer I would have preferred, but at least it allows me to move forward with a handy man without voiding my door warranty.

I think the installation piece offered by Lowe's is great in theory, but it seems like they need to have a crew of simple ""punch list"" type contractors that could have been the solution for my situation.  I'd have been thrilled to have another sub contractor from Lowe's come out to do whatever was necessary to make my door look pretty so I could have used my Lowe's gift cards to cover that additional expense... unfortunately that was not offered to me as a solution which seems like a huge opportunity missed for Lowes.  

The way it worked out now is that Lowe's made money, GR Stevens made money and the customer is left with unused Lowe's gift cards and a door that still needs more work to make it right.  I just don't feel like the intended mark was fully hit in this scenario  :-(",2016-05-24 20:42:00

It's odd to me how extreme the differences in service and quality can be on any given night. Even from the same server, the same night, the next week.

Sometimes, it takes 20 minutes just to get a glass of water - others, as soon as you sit, you've got menus, a nibble, agua, todos. 

So when you're hungry, and need a beer, please, peering around the way-too-tall booth backs can get annoying, quick. If you've got claustraphobic pals, sit at the bar. 

The music improves on off nights - they have DJs that don't care as much about crowd-pleasing as they do about, say, a history lesson in 70s Soul or Surf. Getting an education in Sly while eating Manchego and toasties, while sipping a Xingu or Manhattan, yup, that's about as good as it gets.

Review of the dishes:
1. Beef salad: refreshing starter with tender beef slices
2. Papaya salad: will light your mouth on fire...so be careful when selecting the spice level
3. Yellow curry: a little too sweet for my taste...too much coconut milk and not enough spices
4. Garlic shrimp: while good with a crispy shell that you can eat, it lacks the flavor and crunch factor of the version at Lotus of Siam
5. Basil Fried Rice and Pad Thai: hard to make these dishes exceptional...since they are typical Thai fare....
6. Pork Larb (ground pork): extremely salty, lacking any other distinct flavor
7. Spicy Wings: tastes like sweet and sour to me.....

Usually I am not a big fan of artichoke, but the balance of taste of this dish was quite exceptional. I also tried the deer with malt cream, potato and mushroom, and that was REALLY delicious!

I had their smoked salmon omelet and a double cappuccino.  She got their creme brulee french toast and a mixed greens salad.

Cappuccino was pretty standard; it was slightly above average but not super special.

Smoked salmon omelet came with grilled potatoes and a slice of watermelon.  The omelet also had sliced cherry tomatoes, scallions and dill.  Super fluffy and tasty; I'd definitely get it again!

First came out the free banchan along with the egg broth soup. Really enjoyed the kimchi and the fried corn things with a sweet mayo sesame dressing. The soup was well seasoned. The appetizer topokki we got with a level 4. I like heat and that wad just right. Don't want to imagine level 5 (pain). The rice cakes had a chewy texture so I recommend eating it rather quickly because they do get a little harder to chew when it cools off. Had nice flavor from the gochujang. Sweet, spicy and savory. 

Now to the entrees. The Bibimbap was cool in the stone pot. It kept it hot and cooked the egg when stired. The Japchae I got with chicken. The homemade sweet soy sauce was yummy. The noodle were clear even thou they were made from sweet potatoes. I also got the solomon tea. Had a nice nutty flavor. Truly different from the oolong tea you get in a chinese restaurent, The Chicken Bulgogi Rice was amazing. Had just the right amount of sweetness but still savory. 

The waitress was great at answering any questions, but the entrees came out not even minutes after getting the appetizer and banchan. Thats how we noticed the rice cakes were hard to chew cause we were trying to eat our entrees also when they were still hot. But I say again we were the only ones in there besides the carryout and a couple that came in alittle after we got there. So we will just make sure to tell the wait staff next time when we order out appetizers to hold off the entrees at least 10 minutes cause we were stuffing or faces with the great food so fast. We had no time to chat. Thats the only hiccup that stuck with me. The food was so good and different then any other place around I easy forgive.My mouth was in heaven. I felt like I was in Korea.

Food: The server recommended the lobster club sandwich. He said it was very popular. Presentation was lovely but it lacked taste, gross! I got a fruit salad with my meal. The melon had a fermented taste to it because it was rotten. My boys both had burgers and said, mom please yelp them and give them no stars. Worse burger ever according to them.

Unfortunately, this place suffers from Cleveland Heights Syndrome--there's nowhere nearby to park that doesn't have a parking meter attached to it. It'd be different if there weren't cops hovering around to write a ticket as soon as the meter hits zero, but there are, and the meters are uber-annoying when one makes a random, unplanned stop here but doesn't have money for the parking meters. We don't have type of monkey business here with the coffee shops in Tremont, thank God! (With that being said, I was told after I posted this that there is indeed free street parking by the library. Thus, I pulled my review up a 1\2 star for that, and since I can't do half stars, I threw in another half star for the fact that they have free WiFi and the fact that they don't raise the prices every 15 seconds like Starbucks does. That said, most people who don't know about this fact will park in the meters and I think that it's lame that Cleveland Heights puts those meters everywhere.)

Also, this place has seating for like 10 people...yes, I am exaggerating, but the seating area is indeed quite small. This is especially problematic during periods in which the MCAT\LSAT is looming or whenever med schools\law schools are having exams and folks camp out here all day. (Side anecdote: I'll never forget going to a coffee shop at like 8AM and seeing a med student studying there, complete with a portable lamp. I went there later in the evening and saw the same student in the same exact spot! If the place was 24 hours, I wonder if she would have ever gone home or just slept there on a couch?) 

I like the Phoenix on Lee a lot better--bigger seating area and the omnipresent meters are close enough that one can dash out every half hour and get the free 30 minutes!",2010-11-03 23:33:54
1QHxLy8fhfBt2DeoXjgK7g,5o5X3jrJIG-ObpEtTScMvg,bDtsc7WTwEJZFuvjXy8wng,2,7,1,2,"I came here on Saturday for my bday Pig Roast. We were a party of 15 and super excited as we've heard good things about Bestellen. Alas, sometimes it's best to hear average reviews or nothing at all. It's about managing expectations and ours were a bit too high it seems. 

Overall it was a disappointing meal on all accounts. Food was not great, service lacking, and pacing completely off. Details below.

Background -- For the Pig Roast they charge $59 a person for the pig which they say up to 16 can eat. But if you have 8 peeps minimum u still get the whole pig so if you're gonna go for the roast go for a smaller number in your group -- better bang for your buck. We had 2 large tables from 7pm til about 9ish when they were expecting another big party. 

The Experience --

Food took a while to come out and when it did it come it came in dribs and drabs. After having the salad and risotto balls to start (both of which was good) we sat around for a while as they prepared the sides to go with the pig. Finally a really lovely looking challah bread arrived, sadly I didn't get to taste it as they only made 12 rolls. To be fair, my original reservation was for 12, I had called a few hours earlier to up the number to 15. Unfortunately when I asked for some extra bread the server (not our server but a different guy) was super annoyed that we asked for additional sides. I told him we didn't have enough for the table so he relented and went to ask the kitchen. He came back and told us we couldn't have the challah because they were out then brought us a plate of burnt thick sliced french bread.

We sat for a while longer then some sides showed up for cooling on the table. They were: chard, parsnips and green beans. The portions of the sides are extremely small. They brought one of each per table of 8 which was clearly not enough. We tried to wait for the pig to arrive, but most of us were so hungry we just dug into the sides. The chard was buttery and tasty. The parsnips salty to the point of inedible. The beans were good. The pig's arrival was pretty fun. We got to have a photo op with it before they carved it. The pig was tasty though no crackling. Instead the skin is tough and leathery but the meat is moist and juicy. 

We asked if we could have some more chard to go with the pig -- our server was totally hesitant and said he would ask the kitchen. It turns out it was allowed but round two of chard was saltier than the parsnips -- disgusting actually. I'm parched just thinking about it. 

We carved our pig and ate it, but by the time it was time for dessert (a light carrot cake more like a muffin than cake) we were all pretty much over the experience. Luckily for that because we were rushed out of the restaurant so they could prep for the party that wasn't there yet. Before we left the server did manage a, ""Oh, it's your birthday? Happy birthday then."" I shrugged, said thanks and went on to have a great night elsewhere.

So, to recap. If you're gonna try the pig roast, go with 8 people. The pig is tasty. The sides are hit and miss (mostly miss) and they are super skimpy with the portions and will not be impressed if you ask for more. 

Bang for buck -- I'd say not. They treat this as a prix fixe menu, if you're looking for family style go to Ruby Watch Co. It's cheaper, consistently awesome, you can have all the sides you want, service is fantastic and you'll probably go back again.",2013-11-12 04:38:21

I enjoyed the kale/quinoa salad quite a bit the other day and decided to re-order it at this location along with a margherita pizza. 

My kale-quinoa salad was quinoa-less and the portion was SO tiny.  Albeit still being full, I couldn't believe I paid $16 for two tiny little bowls (we requested it to be split).  The other Moxie's I went to had much more reasonable portions.  On the flip-side, it probably means my caloric intake was less...(yay! more chocolate for me! :P).  However, so much for the chocolate because I specifically asked for dressing on the SIDE.  My server even REPEATED it back to me.  And when it came...dressing was already mixed in.  Gross.  There's nothing worse than over-dressed salad, which is usually what happens and did happen in this case.  

The margherita pizza was also mediocre at best.  I don't know why it's so hard to do an even cheese distribution but my pizza looked like it had a skin disorder with multi-focal aspects of alopecia.  Cheese was seriously lacking and the crust was way too thick.

Their food is pretty great and they play great music. Also have a really extensive beer menu (on tap & by the bottle), wine list as well as an okay cocktail list.

Have been numerous times and have sampled many items on the menu I'll outline my favorites:

- Pulled Pork & Applewood Smoked Cheddar Grilled Cheese: served on sough dough bread, I opted for a side of greens with maple balsamic dressing. Very tasty, super decadent, the pulled pork is an amazing addition 

- Buckingham Blanket - a wrap sandwich with rare flank steak, arugula, caramelized onions, wasabi-mayo wrapped in a Yorkshire pudding-like flatbread. This is my favourite item on the menu, like Sunday dinner in a handheld sandwich

-  Chicken Lollipops - frenched Ontario chicken drumsticks. Tasty, their version of chicken wings

- '37 Cobb Salad - I know, who orders a salad in a bar, but as Cobb salads go, this one was perfect! Included pulled chicken, diced tomatoes, huge chunks of blue cheese, bacon, avocado, eggs dressed with a tasty vinegarette

Have also ordered oysters on the half shell, priced at $2 & $3 depending on the type, they were super fresh and briney and came with the typical oyster sides.

Overall, a good spot if you are looking to please everyone in your party.",2011-08-14 12:42:19

Some updates:
- They've changed their ordering system. The menu is now comprised of a mini notebook that has several copies of the tick sheets. You fill them out and literally rip them out and submit them to your server. It's pretty cute and seemed to be effective as we received everything we ordered. We were able to pencil in notes (example: no dressing on the salad) which was understood.
- Blow torch sushi is now on the menu! 

The food quality is pretty decent. The sashimi is cut thick, fish tastes fresh and is always served cold. I also liked the size of the maki rolls. They didn't have the try-to-fill-you-up rice portion. I really enjoyed the grilled fish. I feel like it could be a signature item of theirs - there was genuine grill flavouring and the fish was very well seasoned. The teppanyaki meats were also great, so props to the grill master! There's a lot of dessert options and their mango yogurt is a really refreshing way to finish up the meal. Just a tip that they have deep fried banana with chocolate sauce under the Golden Deep Fried section which is delicious and an awesome way to make your own banana split!

I will say that we did have some straggler items flow in after we ordered our next round but it wasn't that detrimental to our experience. Just be careful reordering something that hasn't got to your table yet because you might end up doubling up. 

All around enjoyable and I'd definitely return!",2016-06-30 04:17:59

The food is bar food, but, is some of the best I've had for the price. My first venture into this establishment was an eye opener. As I sat at the bar I picked up a menu which was available near all of the seats. It looked like it was 20 years old from a diner. When I looked at the prices they were from 20 years ago. Where can you go and get a burger for $3.50.  An order of fries for $1.50. An order of about a dozen of wings for $5.75. Unbelievable in today's market. The food was great.

Unlike most other buffets, drinks are not included in the initial price. And you pay your bill at the end of your meal, not before. But service is pretty good - dirty/empty dishes are quickly whisked away and drinks are promptly re-filled.

As for the food, there are a few standouts. The wontons were excellent, and almost tasted homemade. Most of the food were full of oil, but it's to be expected at a buffet. Soups were mostly forgettable though.

Dessert and fruit section were pretty vast. The fruits here actually looked and tasted fresh. And there's your standard chinese buffet desserts like soft serve ice cream, almond cookies, macaroons, cake, etc.

Out of everything on their menu, i've only tried their Mango Popice, Strawberry Popice and Chocolate Brownie Ice Cream. 

For their ice cream, it honestly tastes just like regular ice cream. Presentation is great, but other than that, nothing special about it. 

As for the Mango Popice though, I think it's amazing. Unique and delicious! I love how the ""icecream"" part is in tiny balls, nice and frozen. The best part about it is that it's not too sweet. It tastes like milk, which I love. The fresh mango and mango sauce is placed on top and theres more sauce halfway through. If that isn't enough, it comes with a syringe filled will more mango sauce! I find the sauce too sweet, so I usually pass on the syringe. When you finally reach the bottom, there is a milk pudding. The last few times i've tried it, it always tastes like nothing. But my visit from yesterday, surprisingly it finally tastes like milk pudding! Improvement.

Lastly, the Strawberry Popice is also good. But way more sweet than the mango. Plus, I love mango. So if you like strawberry, this would probably be yummy for you!",2017-06-01 19:33:08

I'm not sure what I love more, the cozy vibes or the comfort food! We nestled in to a spacious booth (yes we were that obnoxious couple that sat on the same side) and were excited for a lovely date night! We split the mac and cheese with broccoli and the Pad Thai. Both were just what we needed on a chilly winter evening! The mac is one of my favorites in town - i've been ordering it for years. We even had a decent amount of each for leftovers the next day!

The entertainment varies. Anywhere from coverbands to local music. There was one night where I wanted to jump from the balcony, the music was that bad (Didnt though, I ended up going to Stoneys).

Pricing: So, if you don't use a third-party site, you are looking at roughly 50-100 dollars per person just for normal seats, not the VIP. I ordered my tickets from vegas.com, and got VIP for about 60 per person, and they were amazing spots. I highly recommend getting them early from another place. You must show up to the box office early with your confirmation, the original ID, and you'll be all set. 


Show: Now the show is a burlesque show, lots of sexual fun. I loved how it wasn't just strictly for guys in the sense where the females just stood there naked. They had comedy, singing, dancing, and guest involvement. The show was never dull for us, and it really made the hour go by very fast. You do get a free Jell-O shot, but sadly it seemed that they weren't ready for us. Only some of us got the actual Jell-O shot, the rest got a mix of booze and something else.


Overall: For the price we paid, I was very happy with everything. The show was funny, sexy, and super fun to watch and play along with. I really would recommend this show to anyone, but make sure to get a deal on the tickets. I feel that spending 100 per person on this would be a little steep compared to the other shows I've been to in Vegas. Don't let the name throw any prejudices, this show was worth it!",2018-04-24 02:02:32

We finally completed the trinity by getting to Ticoz over the labor day weekend.  They were having some amazing deals on sangria and we wanted to meet up with friends after First Fridays so it seemed like the perfect chance.

The decor is amazing.  Love the lounge area around the bar, especially the couches.  We sat over in the bar and met up with our friends.  I don't know how long they had been there but they didn't have their drinks yet when we arrived and the waiter didn't exactly rush to come over and take our order.  When he did, he was gone for what seemed like forever getting our drinks.  They came out eventually and they were great.

Then we all ordered some food and I personally got the guacummus or whatever it is.  I'd been dying to try it and totally glad I did.  It was an amazing combo and the pita bread and black corn tortilla chips really made it a great late night meal.  We ordered some more drinks and enjoyed our food.  Everyone seemed to be really happy with their food.

So later in the night, a large section of our group decided they were going to head back to Scottsdale so they asked for their bill.  It took our waiter a while to get their bills and then to pick them back up.  Our friends were a bit annoyed because they really wanted to get out of there before it got too late.  Once they had left, the waiter barely paid any attention to us.  

The funny thing about it is that all of our friends who left were gay and those of us who stayed, are straight.  This fits in with my theory from Fez where only gays get attentive service.  

We practically had to yell at our waiter to get any more drinks by that point in the evening and then, without asking if we were done, he just brought us our bills.  I guess he was ready for us to leave.  In all, it was sort of a mixed experience.  As with Switch and Fez, the service can be terrible on a busy night but great on a normal night.

He wanted to eat at the sushi bar and have the tasting menu so he gets one piece at a time.  You can probably pick out his review.  Personally, I love Japanese food but I don't really care much for sushi or sashimi.  I liked the menu at their old location in Scarborough, but when they moved they dropped most of the things I liked in favor of all sushi/sashimi with a few hot appetizers.  :-( So while he had the tasting menu, I got a selection of appetizers for my meal.  First I got the kuro-ton, which was basically a tonkastu made with Berkshire pork and served with the traditional katsu sauce.  This was one of the better tonkatsu I have had, although a place down in Pensacola, Florida, still takes first place.  Next was the gindara saikyo yaki which was grill black cod marinated in miso which was quite good.  Finally, was the tempura which was a very nice selection of veggies and a couple of shrimp.  The veggies included pumpkin, yam, eggplant, lotus root, snow peas, and shitake mushrooms along with the traditional dipping sauce.  This was probably some of the best tempura I have had.

Second, our orders took awhile to come out and we ONLY ordered 2 rolls, a salad, and an appetizer. Really?  That should not have taken very long to come out!  I was fairly disappointed.  

Good thing the waitress was always apologetic.

We ordered the Garlic Chili Pepper Edamame, best edamame appetizer I've ever had.  Loved it!  We also ordered the rainbow roll; it was fresh and good tasting.  The crispy spicy tuna rice cake was amazing.  Has a nice jalapeno kick to it and definitely something I would come back for.  Their sashimi salad was ok; fish wasn't as fresh as I would have liked it, and I'm not too fond of their salty special sauce.

Ordered online through EAT24 and then picked up on Tuesday 2-2-16 at 5:15 PM.

$9.95 The bizness salad is just a bed of kale with their lemon vinagrette ""massaged"" into the kale and then you pick three sides to go on top of the kale.  I opted for ranch dressing instead of the vinagrette and picked roasted broccoli and hemp hearts, carrot & lentil salad, and curried quinoa.  A nice young man from the cafe called me after I placed my order and said they discontinued the carrot and lentil salad and today I see they have removed it from their menu on EAT24 so kudos to them for that.  I chose brown rice instead of the carrot salad.  When I got home I noticed the broccoli was missing but I went back and checked my order and it wasn't on there so either I forgot to checkmark the broccoli box or there was a glitch in the system.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Their ranch dressing tastes bottled and I didn't like it but the kale was nice and tender and the quinoa was delicious.

$11.95 David's special salad had thinly chopped kale massaged with their housemade lemon vinaigrette and topped with roasted beet/carrot/quinoa salad, curried quinoa, spiced chickpeas, shredded carrots, diced avocado, and hemp seeds.  The chickpeas are so tasty and have a light spice to them.  The beets are the first I've ever tried that I liked.  Truly a delicious and filling salad.

gT-7d3ef7d6aXQAe-jVUhw,YwAbuujxLASmH4jn6iZBYQ,MBekdd_f7S1ezEzZb3o_ZA,4,1,2,0,"I judge cupcakes on two criteria: (1) the quality of the frosting and (2) the moisture of the cake. Both of these factors, of course, sum up to a greater whole. It's hard to talk about the whole without dissecting it into its components. But if you don't feel like reading my whole spiel, I'll just sum up the whole in 2 words: pretty good!

I had the Oreo cupcake. 'Twas recommended by a dear friend of mine who raves about Sweet Daddy Cupcakes like every time we hang out. So there was some considerable hype going into this. Also doesn't help that Sweet Daddy cupcakes were featured on Food Network's hit show Cupcake Wars. Already the stakes are high!

So (1) the quality of the frosting. The frosting for the Oreo cupcake was actually quite delicious. It was unique in that it had almost a granular gravel quality to it since it was permeated with the microscopic crumbs of crushed Oreo cookies. But at the same time, it was still frosting as a whole and very creamy and alluring. Awesomeness.

(2) The moisture of the cake. This is where the cupcake falls short of excellence. The cake itself was moist inside but the outer layers were actually kinda dry. Maybe the batch I ate wasn't very fresh or maybe that's just the way it is. I don't know. But that's just how it got served and I wasn't thrilled about it. 

Another note. The cupcakes here are actually quite big and a little tall. For me, a perfect bite of cupcake should extend from the top where the frosting is all the way to the bottom. And this aspect of design allows for good cake to frosting ratio. It's not a breaking factor but it's something to note for those of you with smaller mouths!

I opted for the breaded chicken salad after contemplating several other items on the menu.  I should have stuck to a sandwich from here.  When the salad arrived, the dressing was missing.  A very important key ingredient to any salad is the dressing.  With me being at work and on a limited amount of time to consume my salad on my lunch break, I had to rummage through the work fridge for some type of salad dressing to top this off.

From the description on the menu you are to receive a handful of fries along with all the other ingredients for this salad.  If they consider this a handful of fries, I consider that they have a two year old working there.  I counted, and there were no more than eight total fries on this salad.  The breaded chicken was actually good.  It appears that they may make it on site (I cannot confirm this), but is was lightly breaded.  Not like the chicken tenders at most other restaurants.  Easily the best part of the salad.

One other shining star to this salad was that they give you a pita on the side instead of bread.  Giving you the option of putting the salad in the pocket and eating while doing other tasks.  But it wasn't shining enough to give this place more than two stars in my opinion.",2014-01-23 23:57:52

I know that Szechuan restaurants tend to mainly have spicy dishes, so I enjoyed the fact that u can order mild to medium spicy level here. 
They start out by giving everyone this drink which is Mung Bean Soup. According to the menu, when you eat something really spicy....this drink will help tame your taste buds....it really works and is refreshing (better than water, and Ill tell you why later).  Our table ordered Spicy Black Fungus- great appitizer/side dish.
Spicy Radish- too hard, difficult to chew.
Chengdu Zajiang Noodles- dry noodles with egg and minced pork
Intestine Noodle Soup-different kinda flavor goin on here.
Steamed Egg with minced pork on side- delish and good amount for price.
Hot and Sour ChaoShou- broth was soo good!
Side of Spare Ribs- ehh plain.
As you know szechuan dishes are packed with flavor and spices and a little oily. As I am eating....Im thinking to myself my tongue feels weird. I told my friends that my tongue feels weird...maybe its oily.....oh wait it feels numb. For a second I thought I was allergic to something, but then my other friend said he felt the same thing hahahahah. I drank some water but that tasted weird as hell. I was like....why does the water taste funny. My other friend said their water tasted bomb. Then my other friend told me that sometimes szechuan food sometimes makes your tongue feel numb from all the spices. OHHH makes sense now! Here is when the Mung Bean Soup comes into play. I kept drinking that and it tasted pretty good to me since my taste buds were all outta wack. It tasted better than water! So thats my experience here.

Now, i need to share this story - I needed some glasses for when I sit at my PC so I can read without tilting my head back to hit the transition lens bifocal.  I decided I'd get a pair for this and keep my old frames and get new lenses for those. I got the new from Optic Gallery but instead of switching out my lenses like I did at Optic Gallery the time before, I got cheap and decided to get the lenses at Costco. Big mistake.  First all, the lenses didn't fit as well as when through Optic Gallery, but also they didn't perform as well and provide the same clarity. So, in this case, you really do get what you pay for and it's worth spending the dough to get the quality for your eyesight.  Don't skimp would be my advice. Hard advice for me to give because I'm pretty cheap.",2018-08-29 21:20:23

Finally he used their regular camera to take it anyway. Then, they couldn't print it for me because they were in the middle of an enormous greeting card order which apparently couldn't be paused long enough to print my picture. They took my name and number to call me when that order was complete and they'd printed my photo. 

Nearly four hours later, I called the store because no one had called me. I stayed on hold four long times while they repeatedly rang the Photo Department, and no one ever picked up. So then I was passed to the store manager, who put me on hold only to come back and say the printing equipment had failed. Uh, and just when was someone gonna call me and tell me this??

The place sure doesn't look like much but that's OK. It's like a tiny lunch counter with some basic outdoor seating. (Where do customers sit in the winter??)

I ordered the fish tacos - basically four soft tacos stuffed with tomatoes and I think baby spinach, and topped with a slice of halibut. Two of the tacos were white flour tortillas and 2 were whole wheat. It was $13.75 + $1.50 for guacamole.

Good
- the fish is grilled so it's healthier than the fried stuff I get at The Battered Fish
- whole wheat tortillas available

Bad 
- the pieces of halibut were small. It was more like a little fish finger in each taco. I shoulda taken a picture! Lol
- nothing special taste-wise. (The halibut fish & chips at The Battered Fish with their signature sauce is way tastier.)

Needless to say, there's something here for everyone, including even gaming consoles!

If you're there over mealtime, there's also a bar and a full-service restaurant within the facility.  We didn't partake at the bar, so I'll leave that for others to review.  The food was average at best, and the although the hostess and waitstaff were friendly, it was very clear that none of them were enthusiastic about being there.  Even with a lot of open tables, it took over 30 minutes to seat our party, and when they did, the tables were cleared but still dirty.  It appeared everyone wanted to be working somewhere else, or not at all.  This strikes me as odd since GameWorks is located in Town Square and is essentially surrounded by other dining options.  With average food and below average staff, and access to a big variety of food within just a few minutes walking distance, it seems GameWorks might want to stick to its primary purpose and make better use of the space by putting in a small snack bar, and using the rest of the floor space for more games.

They spend time making sure you understand the ""routine"" and make you feel like a champ before you even step foot in the workout room.  I love the variability of the workouts as well as the flexibility to increase or decrease the intensity depending on how I'm feeling that day.  They also offer alternative exercises (bike instead of treadmill etc) for those with orthopedic concerns etc.  I truly feel like anyone can workout at OTF and leave feeling accomplished and proud.   I'm relatively new to OTF, only having taken about 4-5 classes so far, with Holly, Lori and LJ...and each one offer's a unique style and motivation to the class.  The prices aren't too bad considering the workout and the equipment being used, and they offer month-to-month contracts so there's no year long commitment like so many ""box gyms"".  The only reason I didn't give OTF five stars is because it's literally like playing the lottery trying to schedule classes.  If you're a planner, good luck...because scheduling is sort of like a full time job.

ju5DiBEjTgxZZMzbUbL6lA,is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,u_vPjx925UPEG9DFOAAvFQ,2,2,1,0,"We are avid Vegas travelers.
We paid extra for an upgraded room here - thought we would try it out as it is one of the only properties we have not stayed in.
The line up upon arrival to check in was INSANE. Yes, Vegas is about crowds, smoke and line ups but there has to be something this hotel can do to speed up the process. Maybe have staff come through the line with a clipboard and some room keys?
Here are some tips about the ""UPGRADE"" which is said to involve superior amenities.
We paid extra to check into our room right away after getting our keys and the maids were still cleaning it.  Nice, waiting outside our room after long flights with our luggage.
To stay in our non-smoking room is like sucking on a fresh cigarette every second. The smoke comes in through the vents 19 floors down, or through the smoking rooms. Health hazard, I feel like crap now! A maintenance guy came to spray disinfectant that did nothing. How do you combat incessant smoke billowing into your room without wearing a mask?
Do not expect a quiet room anywhere - the walls are paper thin. Our neighbors are lovely.... So. Not. Front desk are indifferent, will tell you to call security.
Satellite TV is so choppy that a half hour show went out about 20 times. The fact that we are not here to watch TV is besides the point. We are paying for the amenities and the problem as per the engineer that just left here is that our room's TV was not pixilated yet, so it is a known issue at least for our room. Not good.
One day we were half dressed just back in from the pool and 4 guys came into our room to look into the TV issue! ??? I asked them if they would have come in here without our being here and they answered yes. Kind of odd, that made us feel a bit uneasy. Our cleaning lady has been ok (keeps forgetting to leave us coffee!) but I met a couple in the elevator from another floor who stated that their maid rifled through their knapsack's bottom and stole $20 in change. Jeez!
We had to call the front desk to ask about the smoke, the TV and to ask for a do not disturb sign for our door.
The casino itself is OK, older but has character and the pizza in the food court, NY style is really good as is the baked ziti and chicken parm. Large portions. Staff at the shops at Flamingo are hit and miss with their personalities.
The TV built into the bathroom mirror is cool and the extra shower jets were neat. The shower did not run out of hot water once.
The location of Flamingo on the strip cannot be beat and that is why many stay here as well as a cheaper stay for those budgeting all their cash for gambling.
Next door to the north, MargaritaVille Casino has just opened up. Right next door to the south, Cromwells Hotel and Casino has opened up and that is a nice space to go and check out to see the type of atmosphere not offered by Flamingo.

My friend Romeo and his lady friend had brought me along to their dinner after work, and I've managed to stick around to the later hours of the night. Thank God they were far more civilized people than myself.

I've passed this establishment for years, and during my high school years I always thought that this was the dwelling of Persian gangsters. Now that I am older and more sensible, I have realized that there is no criminal connection here, young Persian Men just dress that way. 

Glorious Shisha, the precious..sacred act of smoking indoors. God Bless the hookah. I asked for two flavours of the charcoal, I ended up with two hookahs. Well played family owned business...
We sat outside at the small street-side patio and it was remarkably comfortable. The cocktails here were fairly priced, the coffee here reasonable as well. Make no mistake, this is a bar which serves coffee, and no the other way around. There are constantly modified cars with bright lights parallel parked outside, but the environment is by no means hostile. 
The waffles and ice cream sundae here are favourites, but I stuck to the White Russian throughout the two hours here. Buda is one of the few cafes in the city that is completely chill, and because it's a bar it makes it that much more remarkable. This explains why it's been here for so long, these owners figured it out. A difficult task considering the location. 
I have an urge to approach the Women at the other tables here despite the Men they're with. That's how chill it was, but I am no fool.
The apple flavoured shisha was delicious. Don't worry about the smoke, it's all flavoured so just pretend there's vitamins.

I find it a bit awkward that you have to go and find your own table and there is no one directing you to a table once one becomes available. You basically have to fight over a table with people if there are lots of other people waiting. You also have to fill your own water and get your own condiments. I guess it is a self serve kind of style, but I like a good restaurant with good service. I also think that the prices should reflect the lack of service they provide too.

I think the Holy Grill is a cute little place for brunch but I don't know if it is one of the best places in Calgary. The food is definitely on the better side, but nothing seemed super amazing to me on the handful of times I've been there. I got side of the homemade dip for my fries and it tasted kind of bland.

The communication has been both courteous & prompt.  Now MEU is the choice for all our reupholster needs.  Thank you Itzel and Hugo.,2016-11-04 20:03:44

The service and selection is great for the most part. I find that by the end of the week they are sold out of a lot of the essentials. Breads, eggs, and other items like it tend to go and they don't always have stock. 

Their pricing is very good. I would say the same products tend to be better priced here over other completing stores in the area. 

The only major issue they have here is the produce. Half the time the produce is not very fresh or uncared for on the shelf.  I had purchased asparagus the other day and there was no water in the tray. Most of the bunches were already wilting. If they could up their produce game just a bit they would lead the area in sales.",2017-05-31 01:45:10

Scott was SO super helpful and really walked us through every step of the pool designing process. He clearly explained each step of the way what to expect and that someone else in his office would be calling before each step of the pool building process. 

The contractors ""broke ground"" on Dec. 27th, 04 and the pool was completed by Feb. 2nd, 05. Phenomenal. And just as promised we received a call each step of the way to let us know who was coming out next, what step of the process they were responsible for and how long it would take. Sometimes we would receive a call from PP's to alert us to contractors who would be coming out when they had already been out and we were about three steps ahead of schedule. 

I HIGHLY recommend PP and S to ANYONE considering putting in a pool. I've had friends go with less well known companies only to have it take six-nine MONTHS, cost them more (than they were promised upfront) and they now are having pool problems that no one wants to resolve. I've yet to have one problem with our pool but know that I can contact PP's if we ever did and we would be well taken care of!",2008-06-17 17:40:16

   When it comes to Cook on Wok:s shrimp chop suey, my taste buds say, ""Baby, your the greatest!"" Well, maybe not the greatest. I am still trying Chinese restaurants throughout the Valley. Regardless, my taste buds elevate Cook on Wok's shrimp chop suey to the 4 star yelposphere. 

  I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant lunch special. In my opinion they are a better value than a fast food restaurant. The Cook on Wok lunch specials include an entree (see my photo), crunchy noodles with duck sauce, white or fried rice, and soup of the day where an additional $2 upgrades to wonton soup. Their wonton soup is over and above the typical wonton soup that includes shrimps. On the other hand, I also enjoyed their hot and sour soup (included). The lunch special menu trails behind several Chinese restaurants in variety. After eating their SHRIMP chop suey, I am decided on ordering it when I done here. Although, the plate is not overflowing with food, it is flowing with the delicious ingredients of shrimp chop suey. Cook on Wok is generous with the number of shrimps. Every bite is delicious from the shrimp and vegetables down to the broth. With the lunch special I order a Coke that they serve in a generous size glass. Before the tip, the total adds up to approximately $12.

 Twice in recent times, I have made the right turn from Warm Springs Road into the Circle K parking lot at the southeast corner of Stephanie Street and parked in the adjacent parking lot to dine in Cook on Wok. Upon walking inside, the friendly gentleman walks me to the table a few minutes before becoming my waiter. The atmosphere is one of a dine in Chinese Restaurant instead of a take-out. It is a clean and relaxing environment. 

  I recommend Cook on Wok for their shrimp Chop suey lunch special. I support this recommendation with my signature of four stars.",2015-01-10 02:01:35

Okay enough with the p alliteration and whining.  Maybe it's because I was a little annoyed at the whole covert operation of finding this place tucked behind Weslodge, or maybe I'm just getting too old for pomposity, but I'll stop being surly now as the whole reason for being at Patria was to send the lovely Joie T and Mark off in grand  style before their exodus across the pond  :(  Bon Voyage guys!

I won't lie the seafood paella at Patria is very good, even if it is a smidge burnt, but for 40 bucks it's kinda steep.  Portions of tapas were smallish in size, and the cocktails were meh, but the sangria according to Edwin and Tamara was pretty epic.  For those who are inclined towards cured porcine delights, they will be elated to know that Patria serves Iberico pig and many incarnations of all things ham adorned and bacon wrapped and chorizo flavoured oink-oink!!

Service here was either hot or cold.  The manager and the one server (wish I knew his name, he was so awesome and really sweet!) we had were outstanding and even offered to happily take pictures for us, and you know how discerning Asians are about picture taking in restos dammit!!  Anyway those two gents were real nice, while the one other server seemed more annoyed by our table if anything else...wha-wha :(

High marks goes to the peeps who pimped this place out!   Atmospherically speaking Patria has a beautiful and spaceous lofty interior that is part nouveau frontier rustic chic, paired with bodacious quasi iconographic Spanish(?) Neo-Mannerist paintings (art history minor represent!) there is even a sexy upstairs area cordoned off for private dining (brush that dust off your shoulder...)  

If you want to see and be seen noshing on spendy Spaniard tapas heavy on the pork tip, in gorgeous surroundings, then break out the LV wallet and get your ""Blue Steel"" on for Patria, but myself, I think I'll stick to wearing track pants and getting my seafood paella fix in my mum's kitchen gracias.",2013-02-07 18:31:59

The food and service were an added bonus.  Alex was my server and he did a great job checking on me and answering sightseeing questions.  I ordered the gyro and cole slaw, which I found out from Alex is made in-house.  It has a delicious flavor, different from the run-of-the-mill cole slaws.

My husband had a lamb dish and his was great too, had almost a vindaloo taste. The four stars are due to the waiter, he was very slow and rarely checked back. It was almost 10 mins after we sat down before he came to get our drink order. After we started eating it was so long that I had to flag him down to get water as I had no drink. The second reason was my husband ordered his food as spicy as they could make it, I tasted it and was nothing near other restaurants.

The customer service is amazing and the employees are super nice - they will remake the drink to your liking if you are dissatisfied with anything. 

My favorite drinks are the Hokkaido, Okinawa, and Taro milk teas. The Hokkaido milk tea is a perfect blend of creamy sweetness. For their taro milk tea, they actually use real taro which I love! I've also tried their Sunset on the Beach and Honeydew slushies which were very refreshing and tasty.  Definitely would recommend these drinks!! 

The boba and egg pudding have always been fresh and taste great with the perfect amount of sweetness. Never had any problems with the boba being too chewy or hard like other boba places. 

Their menu is quite extensive ranging from slushies, lattes, iced teas, milk teas and even fresh brews. They even offer crepes if you want more than just drinks.

There was so much buzz surrounding it for a couple months after it opened, and some of my gay friends still rave about it. So I finally tried it on Saturday for lunch and was a little dissapointed.

First off, I don't care if you are gay. That is absolutely your choice and I respect you making choices for yourself, but please for the love of god hire ONE person that still talks like he has a pair of testicles. Every waiter, bartender, and host that we encountered was almost inaudible and spoke in such a high tone of voice that I actually thought I was speaking to women.

Secondly, being the only table in the bar (+1 table in the patio area) should mean that we get decent service. Watching 4 staff members stand in a close proximity circle behind the bar talking about how much they drank last night and forgetting to bring us more drinks, a bill, my credit card back after I paid the bill, etc. is a little disconcerting. Perhaps even more disconcerting than my lack of ability to spell or my run on sentences. 

Finally, when I tell you that I think your Pork Chile Verde dish has an almost inedible salt content, and you reply back to me ""I've been telling them that for a long time and they wont change it,"" it's obvious that something is going wrong in your lines of communication. You wouldn't tell me that if a) you didn't also feel that way or b) you've heard other customers say the same thing. Regardless, what you should have said is ""well I appreciate the feedback sir, may I offer you another dish with a lower salt content? and I'll be sure to let the chef know what you thought as well.""

My order was for Som Tom, green papaya salad made Thai hot, and leave the green beans off, along with a bowl of steamed rice.  The waiter did not know the Thai name for green papaya salad, so he was going to open the menu when I told him what Som Tom is.  He repeated back my order, with no Thai hot and no steamed rice.  I repeated the order, which he still did not write down and again he missed the Thai hot.  The third repeat from me got an accurate verification from the waiter.  He headed off toward the kitchen.  After about 10 minutes, my salad appeared, sans rice.  I figured he would bring the rice shortly, so I sampled the salad

A properly prepared Som Tom is an artwork that brings flavors of sweet, sour, salty and spicy together in a harmonious combination that allows each to sing.  There should be clearly definable notes of lime, fish sauce and garlic in the mixture, with the sweet coming from tomato and palm sugar in the salad.  I got notes of salty (fish sauce) and sweet (granulated sugar, not palm) but the spice, lime and garlic were not there. 

When I placed my order, I asked for Thai Hot.  Sometimes, it works and sometimes it does not.  On my initial sampling of the salad, I evaluated the spice level at about 2 (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings a tear to my eyes).  After sampling, I put my fork down and spent 10 minutes trying to get any serviceperson's attention.  One waitress looked my way and I waved her over, asking about the rice I ordered and requesting that she bring chile and a lime to the table.  She took my order back to the kitchen and after about 5 minutes,  she returned  from the kitchen with my salad and rice.  I looked at the same preparation, though there was what appeared to be more fresh chopped Thai chile.  The 'updated salad went from a spice level of 2 to a spice level of 3.

While my salad was being adjusted, another couple came and sat at a table near mine.  The waiter came by and asked about beverages, which they ordered.  As a side-note, it took my flagging down the waiter nearly 10 minutes later to ask for water and to point out that he had apparently forgotten about the other table, as they had no water and had not placed an order.  Another table nearby finished and a waitress came by to pick up the tip.  She did not immediately clear the table, but she sure wanted the tip.  It was nearly 5 minutes before she returned to clear the table.

Portion size on the salad was about 1 cup, small  for the price.  Normally, Som Tom is served either on a cabbage leaf or with a wedge of cabbage.  This version was served in a lettuce leaf with shredded carrot (about 2 tablespoons) on the side.  The rice bowl, which was $2 was also about 1 cup.  

It was certainly a struggle deciding between 1 and 2 stars...though I finally decided on one.  Between long waits, no beverage service unless I requested it, no rice being brought with the order and inability to even come close to the desired spice level, your restaurant did not satisfy.  I hear there are 2 other Thai restaurants within the same block, so after I try the other two, I may return.",2013-03-31 16:56:13

The dinner plates are huge. Can totally share if your a small eater as it also comes with miso soup and salad. 

Food:
The a la carte spicy tuna rolls was pretty good. But the rice in it was just ok. Not fluffy enough and not enough vinegar it it. The wasabi is from original squeeze bottle ones rather than the fresh seedy ones that are the best and freshest.
I got the Chicken Zen dinner combo that comes with teriyaki chicken, shrimp/veggie tempura, 3 cali rolls and 3 nagiri rolls, miso soup and salad for $21. The soup is just plain miso soup. No tofu or seaweed in it. Their chicken remind me of jidori chicken. It was ok but not great. Rice was ok but again, not as fluffy. Sashimi was also ok. Too much rice though and its not the freshest as its a bit firmer like the rice had been left out a little too long and hardened a bit. The California rolls that came with it also were the least fresh. The tiny fish roe in them were so fishy and possibly old and bad. Given possible doubt it may not be them that (a few hrs later) gave my husband and I diarrhea, it was the last thing we ate, same thing we ate together, and raw.

nhgmHygATqP78TwzbPDuUQ,qUk-Qa1JYnuK4VmmEbSYsA,wlcHT4d52xh52ZsIxxuGFg,3,6,3,3,"One bite of the Smashburger veggie burger had me wondering if there's a conspiracy amongst burger makers to create veggie burgers as punishment for people that have decided to stop eating meat. While they work on the recipe in their kitchen, I wonder if they're thinking, ""You wanna stop eating meat??!!? There! Eat THIS!!""

There isn't 1 good veggie burger I've had from any food place. I've had zero beef for 18 years (tons of carbs, though), so I could say I've had more than a few veggie burgers. And I think maybe I've had enough. I'm at a point where I'm ready to give up, because it looks like the best veggie burgers are all in the freezer section of grocery stores.

Always an afterthought, restaurant veggie burgers are never taken seriously enough. Maybe burger joints just don't want to lose out on sales (understandably), so they add a veggie burger to their menu. Unfortunately, the taste of these burgers reflect this decision.

The Smashburger veggie burger itself was as expected, a mushy mess salvaged by the egg bun, the cheese & the truffle oil. I wonder if they had cows taste-test the burger, & the cows were like MOO, it's OK, thanks for our lives or something. I mean, I dunno. If your granola friend has been trying to get you to convert to veg, this wouldn't be the burger she would be having you try.

The service was great but Smashburger, please make a good veggie burger.",2016-07-11 01:18:17

The fried rice was intentionally Asian-style as the chef/owner says it's fusion based. The beef was absolutely delicious: very high quality meat and delicious with spicy suya seasoning. If you haven't tried suya, consider it a priority as it's a wonderful taste and a building heat which I love. Towards the end you'll really feel it. The rice was pretty good, but it was a bit oily which scales my review down a bit.

The next time I went in, I had a Suya beef wrap, and I think wraps are their bread and butter (so to speak). The beef was as described above, and it came with a nice cream-based sauce and some veggies. I feel it could've used a few more veggies, but great overall. I also tried a friend's chicken wrap which was also great. Everything is also cooked and prepared fresh, including the meat which is very important. They can prepare it at any spice level, and if you're a heat-seeker, they can really give you some pretty intense heat if you want it.

On the wraps alone, I'd probably give it 5 stars. I was debating whether to give it a 4 over the rice which wasn't perfect; however this is probably the best wrap you'll get in town, so I'll go with a 5 overall. There's a tonne of flavour options as they create (and sell) their own spices. Something different for adventurous types, but many options to keep it accessible for most. I wish it was a bit closer to me, as I'd probably go more often, but still highly recommended.",2015-01-25 12:24:44

The only reason I gave 2 stars is for service. The service was outstanding, of course we came during an off peak dinner time, so maybe there was an excess of waitstaff. 
I had a chicken fajita chimichanga, not what I expected. Could have been decent if prepared the correct way. There was one large pepper on top of few cubes of chicken, all wrapped in a doughy tortilla. And, quite honestly, it very well could have been pre-made and reheated upon ordering. It was definitely not fresh tasting. The beans tasted like they were straight from a can and the rice was dry and flavorless. Both remained on my plate. My husband and I split an order of nachos, which we actually laughed at when it was delivered to the table. Not quite what we were expecting. It was five pieces of halved corn tortillas with a sprinkle of meat and melted cheese.   When we order nachos, we expect actual nachos; not floppy melted cheese.

The restaurant is quite small and the night that I came here, they had a drum set and a stage which was new. There are two mini levels to this restaurant, and for a Wednesday night, the place was already quite packed. There was only one waitress for the entire restaurant and when my dad requested red crushed pepper flakes, it was promptly forgotten. 

However, the food more than made up for the lack of service. I always have the Berkshire Sausage Ragu pasta which is hearty, rich, and the pasta done perfectly al dente. Pasta dishes come with garlic toast and salad with a very refreshing sauce. My parents opted for the Japanese inspired dishes and they both had Spaghetti with Manilla Clams glazed with a miso ginger sauce. They devoured it in no time. We were still hungry so we shared the Crepes Azuki with a chunk of ice cream...yum!

I really love coming here. The food is so very delicious and the Japanese/Italian fusion dishes actually work! Plus, they have house wines (red and white) for only $5 a glass and its not bad.

Like @Allison Y, I envisioned a ton of flavors to try. They have about 10-12 flavors each day, but they rotate through a plethora of unique flavors. I appreciate that in the span of two weeks, most of the flavors I tried on my first visit were no longer available. This isn't to say that I thought the ones I had the first time were bad. I just want to try more of their flavors. 

The two highlights of trip 1 were the pad thai and the ginger saffron vanilla (I hope I got that one right). The first one I'd say is for the more adventurous among us, myself included. It was like peanut butter, but with hints of spice and other things. It was my favorite flavor. The ginger saffron vanilla was good too. My friend and I called it, ""safe adventurous"". It's got a familiar base, vanilla, but it's got notes of saffron and ginger that push the envelope slightly, but not too much. Distinctions go to whichever buffalo milk flavor they had that day. That was cool! A tad yogurt-y.

I actually enjoyed the flavors from trip 2 more than trip 1. I tried the black garlic fennel that I believe they had at the Garlic Festival. I'm not sure about the garlic, but I definitely tasted the fennel. For people who don't know what fennel tastes like, it's that distinct sausage taste. Not the meat part. The spice part. I actually did trip 2 because I really wanted to try their corn on the cob flavor. To be more specific, it's corn on the cob with butter and thyme. You can definitely taste the butter in there, and the sweetness of the corn. We ended up getting the kraken though (18 or 19+). Yeah. They have a gelato flavor with an age limit. The name alone had me sold. I had no idea what it was though, so I asked. Apparently, Kraken is a spiced, black rum. This gelato definitely tasted boozy. Also spiced. And definitely black, for all of you black ice cream trend chasers. It's great for people who don't have much of a sweet tooth. This is the least sweet ice cream/gelato I've ever tasted. It's also got bitter notes, so do take note.

If I'm in the area, I'm definitely going to come back and see what else they have. Adventure!",2017-09-26 15:08:17

The staff is always super friendly and they will always help you with the menu. It is always a good time when you go there too, because Kenny will always come out and talk to you. If it's not too busy he will sit down at your table. His story is really amazing and he is a super guy! If you have been there a few times and have a feel for the menu, you can tell Kenny what you like and he will make you food based on what you tell him! We have had him do that twice with the chow main noodles, and we have yet to be disappointed! If chef Kenny ever gets on the Food Network or the Travel Channel WATCH OUT because he will explode! His food is so YUMMY! If I could do what he does in the kitchen, there is no question that my family and I would all be enjoying the vegan lifestyle!!!",2013-05-22 14:38:09

We were all tired, hot, sweaty and eating one of these cream puffs.... and all of the women were glaring at me in terms of pure love AND hate for bringing a box of these and wiping out the previous hour's workout.   There were many things said, like ""this is the best thing I've ever had"", ""OMG"", ""I'm going to kick you in the b**** for ruining my diet but thanks for the awesome cream puff"". ""pure sweet heaven"" ""we're going to pound you dead for this but yum!"" and ""I've never had anything this creamy in my mouth"" (yes, I know this last one could be a risque quote, but it's true!).  And then I had one....

Cruffs is a specialty dutch cream puff and pannekoek (a dutch version of the crepe) maker in Mission (and Calgary Farmers Market).  But of course, there is a twist!  Imagine a pretty huge cream puff, and fill it with some truly tasty variations, such as strawberry cream, chocolate, chantilly, banana, baileys irish cream and quite a few more.  The pastry part of the puff is light, crisp and airy as it should be, while the cream is rich and sinful, yet also still fairly light.  Guys, so long as your wife or girlfriend is not lactose intolerant, think of it as kryptonite.  It'll definately weaken her to your demands to let you hang out with the guys instead next Valentine's day! (well... maybe Arbour Day really...)  Still, it'll definately charm the gals, and the guys will just like it period (though NOT with beer).

Just go on in, ask for a number of big or small puffs, pick out your cream flavours (they literally inject them with cream in front of you) and enjoy!  Wait, maybe enjoy in front of a window of a fitness club to make it ever more sinful.  Slow small bites into each puff to properly display the sensuous cream inside.  Stretch it out... make the fitness people suffer. (Yes, I know this is cruel, but I never said that I wasn't an evil reviewer :P)

In a funny trivia way, the family that owns and operates it are following their tradition, despite being Indonesian.  This family previously owned the popular resto on 14th St SW, The Indonesian, before selling it and going off on their own business adventures.  The chef and main owner does Indonesian food catering on the side, while other members of her family opened Cruffs.  Indoneisa, being a former Dutch, colony, picked up a lot of their culture and foods, and vice versa.  To get a really good idea and if you've had Indonesian before, head over to Indonesian Kitchen on 17 Ave SE for a meal, and you'll see how many Indonesian dishes are what you may have thought was dutch!",2012-05-15 18:02:49

I really don't understand the hype behind this place. Perhaps this place is very spacious compared to other izakaya venues, which provides sufficient personal space without having to bump shoulders with strangers while dining. In fact, this place is about twice the size of Guu and probably triple of Nome. However, the tightness in space is more authentic in izakaya experience. That being said, the venue size didn't really make much of impression on my overall rating of this venue.
I came to this place with my company for a holiday dinner. We pretty much ordered everything off the menu. Having tasted most if not all items, I have yet to find a particular dish that impressed me. There was NOTHING on the menu that I was dying to have a second bite or make a second order.

I called ahead and snagged 2 seats at the bar for the 60$ 5 course menu. They called to verify any allergies and to make sure about any other dietary restrictions that we may have.

The menu here is constantly changing as it's based on what they find at the market that looks awesome. My dinner mate had some beef that made her tear up, it was THAT delicious and I had the yummiest fish with just the perfect amount of sauce, they truly nailed it. The vegetables were all done perfectly and we could see 90% of the prep done right in front of us which is always fun.

The wine list is large, but solid and they have quite a few by the glass. Definitely sit at the bar so that you can watch the action and meet cool new people. There aren't many tables as the place is tiny (it's the old Van Horne), so if you aren't a bar person, be sure to make your reservation WELL ahead of time if you really want a table. They've also got a hella fancy Japanese toilet, so don't wait until you're on the brink of being unable to wait, because people seem to take their time in there playing with all of the settings (12 minutes, lady...seriously.)

I felt like that lady in the IKEA commercial that is speed walking out of the store yelling ""Start the car!! START THE CAR!!"" because for 60$ for that incredible meal, I feel like it was a serious bargain.

But back to the task at hand. Tamale store. We were introduced to them at the begining of last year on a day trip up to Payson, where we noticed they had just started up a Farmer's Market in the Chili's parking lot on Highway as you enter town. Heck yes, we decided to stop. 

Lots of great stuff there, you should definitely check it out, but most notably were the tamales! I claim tamale tasting expertise based on the 27 years of consumption,and yes these are Fantastic. 

I became a rabid fan of their green corn, red beef, chicken chipotle. And I will never pass up any opportunity to buy these scrumptious moist delicacies.

Beside the amazing tamales, the staff is INCREDIBLE. They taste out their tamales to everyone that wants some, and bags up the orders with a true awesome love for what they do. They are very helpful and informative for the tamale retarded and find the flavor that you are going to love. 

They have veggie and vegan options which are great. And they sell out fast. The girl told me later in the season on another visit, that they always sell out in Payson, so if you go to this market, head to this booth early. They drive up from Cave Creek, so what they have for that day is IT.

Don't pass this place up.

Oh, P.S. In case you were wondering....way WAY better than anything my family made this ""tamale season""  (luckily none of them have any clue what Yelp means)",2011-01-29 15:59:37

Outside however, there is an abundance of chairs & tables all the way into the centre of the square- a great place to sit and people watch.
Balzac's feature a small selection of fair trade and organic drip coffee blends in addition to barista prepared beverages and small baked items which are pricey.

Let me explain; At a traditional sushi restaurant, eating Omakase means ""Chef's choice"" which means you let the chef create whatever they desire, in order to give you the best sushi experience. That does not necessarily mean expensive, but you will get to try maybe some new fish that is not currently on the menu or rolls that are unique and custom. It has been at least 10 years or more since I ordered off a sushi menu, and ordering Omakase helps me to appreciate the sushi offered, as well as let the chef know we trust them to give us the best sushi experience. When I sat down at this new sushi restaurant, the waitress which seemed to be an older Japanese lady scoffed when I told her Omakase. She told me flat out that every other sushi restaurant had been lying to me and that Omakase was not real. Then they called over the chef which seemed to be a very young American guy, again not a problem, but he sad that the reason they don't do Omakase is because they don't have expensive enough fish; again obviously in a sushi restaurant this sushi chef does not understand what Omakase is. Finally the other waitress a young Asian girl mention that the reason they don't do Omakase was because if they dialed up a roll for $16 people would freak out. Frankly none of these three people understood what Sushi tradition really is; Sushi is not about just feeding your belly, it's about enjoying the art form of how they put the sushi together. If it's a matter of just feeding my belly, trust me I can go to anywhere else and get that done.

Only exception was the sushi section where I thought the nigiri were not quite up-to-par.  Service was typically stiff but very timely.

Here's what I liked:
- Crab legs were great, and unlike most places not salty at all.  Only if I saw that giant pot of melted butter earlier...
- Seasoned crabs also, which I did not have but mum said was good
- Raw oysters!!!!
- Crawfish was yummy, they put some type of seasoning on it that was great.  As with any steamed crawfish, it's a pain-in-the-ass to eat though.
- Mussels in the mayo-based sauce was great, mussels were plump
- Clam in some type of garlic(?) sauce was also great
- 4 types of soups - miso, wonton, hot & sour, and egg drop were good
- Several flavors of ice cream
- Fried bananas were awesome!
- Mandarin orange - the canned kind, but I love those
- The apple strudel-looking thing looked really good, but did not have room in my tummy
 
Didn't like so much:
- As mentioned above, stay away from the sushi
- Desserts were not great.  I had the cream puffs and they were awful.
- Fried rice tasted like the ones at fast food places, not Chinese restaurants
- Overall Chinese dishes didn't look impressive
 
With at least twice as many good as the bad, and with the goods being so much bigger in stature, this place gets big ups.  4-star food, not quite, but 4-star deal, it is.

Yes, the bar is cool and the patio is nice (even though it was freakishly warm last Friday) but what really struck me was the people.

I really enjoyed the people here. 

- I have lots of reasons to go back here, but one thing in particular must be to try their version of the already awesome Moscow Mule. I am not sure what's added or changed, but the house version is stated to be awesome and I will find this out for myself. 

A negative is that they only have one little bathroom. That's unbelievable. And if the case would be that there are more bathrooms, then the negative is that I couldn't find them. An important thing when creating a comfortable drinking establishment, must be to make the act of relieving yourself and quick and easy ordeal - otherwise lots of valuable drinking time gets wasted in the pursue and wait of previously said relief.

I had a $100/yr for life basically unless they went out of business fee and loved it.  But, if you only go once a year or 2, that makes for very expensive visits.

Originally, i really enjoyed my membership, but I found about 10 yrs after having the membership, the various LA Fitness locations were just meat markets and a bunch of unintelligent muscle heads.  One time in the swimming pool I found a tampon.

Some of the LA Fitnesses were just plain dirty and gross.  I did get a Lifetime Fitness  membership in 2003 and I just didn't want to pay for 2 memberships, even if it was only $100/yr.  

I do like that LA Fitness has many locations and not only in Arizona, but I found their trainers to be mediocre (many of them, not all of them).  Turn over was high.  So, even for the $100/yr membership, which breaks down to about $8/month, which included towel service, it wasn't enough to entice me.

Why? First they grind their own meat. Guessing chuck, brisket and sirloin? Just a guess....but it was super juicy and flavorful. You can get it however doneness you wish....But to me, it was their BUN which made this incredible! Had to be Brioche, and it was UBER soft and buttery. You've read my reviews which have panned places for having crappy buns or them being made out of depleted uranium! Not here folks!

Now the burger normally comes with blue cheese. Well, that's not my fave, so they gladly substituted Gruyere and I was a very happy camper!

Of course, NO visit to George's is ever complete without getting their crispy Brussels Sprout leaves with Balsamic Glaze....I claim that it is quite possibly THE BEST APPETIZER in Charlotte! No kidding. Brussels Sprouts??? YUPPER!

The tofu summer roll was pretty tasty and I liked that they included hot sauce in the to go bag as well. This place didn't blow me away, but I think based on other reviews I might just have ordered the wrong things.

This location is further than other dim sum places for me. But we came here because my dad was here recently with a friend and said it was okay. So we went to try it. 

Every day before 11 am they have a morning special all sizes are 2.99 but after 11 am items are charged per size. A large was 4.99 (which most items are categorized as btw.)..sigh...already on the pricier side of dim sum places. What really annoyed was that they did not serve Guantang bao (soup dumpling). I've never been to a dim sum place that did not serve it...It's my favourite dish and I always get it! So from there, I had already set in my mind I would not return for dim sum. But carrying on with the rest of the food, it was decent nothing really stood out. The fried items were nice and crispy but the sauce for the beef tendon and beef ribs were really watered down :( I've definitely had better. 

The location itself is new and was not busy considering it was a Saturday prime time. Location is decent plenty of parking since it is in a plaza with no other big restaurants. The decor is a typical Chinese restaurant however the entry way is very cramp little to no room for standing. The washroom is right near the entrance too so there are people walking back and forth constantly which would get annoying if it were busier. 

The service was decent, they were very good with refilling water/tea which is sometimes hard to find in most dim sum places. Getting a table, in the beginning, took longer than needed, we saw a couple empty tables and it took the hostess a while to seat us. I guess she was too busy entertaining ""regulars"" -eye roll-

TL;DR: there are better dim sum places, did not have Guantang Bao (big soup dumpling), expensive, early bird special before 11 am.",2017-09-02 23:47:28

I like this Walmart. Staff are always happy to help with you if you have any questions. Lineups are shorter here than at most Walmart stores. I can always find what I need here.

Produce looks fresh every time I visit. I like the individual cheesecake slices that you can get. You can get a cheesecake slice to go or bring it to work. Perfect!

Aisles are wide. I tend to get bottles of peanuts. There are plenty of varieties and decent prices.

Washrooms are clean. You can get your hair done and even visit Axess Law to get a divorce, if you needed to. I'm not kidding! Talk about one-stop shopping!

It is a you-queue-and-order-and-take-a-seat place, where the pizzas are cooked in 3 minutes in the wood-fired ovens (two of them !!) and carried to you by waitresses that find your table number sign.  The walls are covered with large modern art paintings, the tables and fixtures are modern but warm, and the food quality is excellent.  What is surprising is that the prices are not high, but geared for the lunch crowd.  And that is why the place was full of young office workers.

We ordered a trio of pizzas:
- Pizza Pizzuvio
- Pizza Margherita D.O.C.
- Pizza Marinara

The Pizzuvio ($10) is half calzone and half Margherita, merged together in a seamless union (neat idea !!).  The interior of the calzone is mostly ricotta milk cheese, with some salami and ham, and a few sliced cherry tomatoes.  The dish that was served to us seemed a bit smaller than others that I saw in other tables (see the photo and you can see the white brim of the dishware on the perimeter), but I guess I was the unlucky one to get the smaller of 'em all.

The Margherita D.O.C. ($12) is a version of the regular Margherita ($8) but with premium bufala mozzarella.  Baked to perfection, the dough was clearly prepared the day before and fermented and raised to acquire the best flavor.  Thank you for bringing back the true pizza Napoletana to Pittsburgh (the first honors goes to the veteran of 'em all, Roberto Caporuscio, who started in Pittsburgh his culinary adventures over a decade ago).

The Marinara ($7) is a very thin crust tomato sauce and garlic oven-baked circular flat bread, with flavoring of oregano.  Delicious and tasty.  I would have added a free option of just a few bits and pieces of anchovies (""acciughe"") but I understand that for American tastes, that would have been very difficult to accept.

Overall, quite an establishment.  I just love 'em crowds at lunch, boisterous, eating, chatting. And rushing back to the office. It's a movement.  It's an ocean current.  Its fast but good. Sure, it would be nice to have a few Fiaschetta di Vino, but, alas, here in America, that is not allowed.",2017-02-02 01:21:49

An amazing combination of flavors that all popped - especially the roasted tomatoes. I was a tiny bit disappointed because even though it was waygu, my burger was on the dry side....so I think it was slightly overcooked. 

The hard shake I decided on was the Burnt Almond Torte and it made my eyes roll back in my head! Spiked with amaretto and vanilla vodka and swirled with chunks of Prantl's Bakery burnt almond torte. The shake was also topped with a dense whipped cream which held up candied almond slivers. As delicately as I could, I inhaled it!

This is a hip, pseudo avant-garde hotel, just outside of the main downtown/city area. Newly renovated club-like atmosphere of a lobby, plus room was pretty cool (way hipper than you'd expect for Calgary - no offense, Calgarians), beds were comfy, solid selection of tv channels, great valets/bellmen. 4 stars. 

Stayed here 1 night for business travel, so if you, too, are a business traveler, please read on. 

Hotel Arts is not for the true business traveler at all, which is why I can barely give it 2 stars. For example, we business travelers tend to check in later at night, since we typically fly out after business hours (i.e., fly after the regular work day is done), which also means we tend to arrive starving b/c we were in-air during dinnertime. Problem is, even with 2 full service (pretty cool-looking) restaurants on premises, neither of them served food past 10p; and the ""real"" room service menu also stops taking orders @ 1030p. Despite the fact that they state they have 24-hour room service, that's kind of a joke. Be forewarned, my fellow-Yelpers-who-can't-just-eat-shite, that your choices after 1030 pare down to cheesecake, a side salad or a bbq pork sandwich. (I am not exaggerating or joking whatsoever, they specifically read me the choices.)  When I went downstairs to the restaurants in search of some real food, both places told me I was s.o.l., that all of the cooks had gone home and that the front desk never knows their correct hours of operation (I won't even get into that). So, I ask the front desk - their reply: ""Sorry about that but it is a Monday, you know.""  Uh... and your point is...  Canadians don't eat dinner on Mondays?  Hence, underlining my beef about this not being for the business traveler. 

Oh, and I would say they desperately need to upgrade the fitness center (see my pics), or at the very least install more lighting - it's totally dim and cramped and kind of creepy, especially if you're working out at night, which again, we business travelers have to do!",2009-12-04 23:51:58

Their painkiller cocktail drink is my favorite cocktail drink in the valley so far; I've ordered it every visit!  Very tasty.",2017-08-24 19:09:53

I was trying this out with much enthusiasm based on the reviews.

Twenty-five minute wait was muted by the delicious coffee.

Great service during the entire visit.

Gluten-free options for the gluten-sensitive!

I had the Seared Tuna tostadas which come with 3 of those and a huge portion of BC Kennebunk fries. Very very delicious.

So, by now, you are wondering why only three stars?

Automatic two (2) star reduction for low quality condiments (no exceptions).

The cost of the higher quality condiments even in Canada is negligible and yes I have checked on the retail side.

Condiments are the Gordon Food Service (GFS) brand which have High Fructose Corn Syrup (glucose-fructose in Canada). How do I know? A search on Google revealed zero (0) results saying otherwise. Nothing on the GFS website listed anything for ingredients or natural claims.

It is 2015 and with all the different brands of condiments such as Safeway, Annie's, and Heinz has a line of condiments without this garbage in it, there are zero (0) excuses for a place of this caliber to have such low quality condiments.

Don't agree, then gluten-free should not exist either. Take me out to breakfast, lunch, or dinner and let me have some of the low quality condiments and see how sick I get.",2015-10-03 16:34:25
zoewuB97vUgwAqJP2vo-jA,7GIcGERUfVvOx_TNYomGcA,buacGSEw8yLGJo8g-i02wg,4,0,0,0,Been to Pisces several times for sushi or drinks @ Metropolitan. The food and sushi is almost always good there so you can't go wrong. I also love the hidden booths on the side of the restaurant (great little spot for a romantic date) but I rarely get one. Pisces is a decent place to go for sushi in a town with a lot of sushi options. The reason I am writing this review now is that I went to Pisces last night for a drink and found 1/2 priced glasses of wine on Mondays (and a packed restaurant) --which was a nice start prior to our dinner @ Dressler's next door. The bartender told us about the various drink specials throughout the week as well as M-F 4-6PM 1/2 priced food for happy hours. More good food & drink for less cost.,2015-09-29 17:45:48

I have an Audi TT and it is my baby.  I had taken it to various ""import"" shops in charlotte over the years.  One would never call me unless it was to sell me more stuff.  Eurowise was much different.  They called me when they figured out what was wrong to get authorization, they called me as soon as my car was ready so I didn't make any trips out there for no reason, they also called to know if I was picking it up that night or if they should pull it it.

They fixed what I took it in for and even identified a problem I didn't mention after another mechanic told me I was just making it up.  I endured that issues for months and Eurowise fixed it right up.

Plus they are right off the light rail line so I don't have to hound people to take me to pick up my car.

When I visited this location, it was confusing how you need to order at the lower level and then go upstairs to get a table. But luckily they bring you your orders to the upper level instead of having you go back downstairs. 

Service: the service was adequate. Not much service needed since everything is self service. But I think the employees could have been more enthusiastic about their job especially during their first month of opening.

Food: I ordered the taro shaved ice. It was really watery and it didn't blend together as much as I would like. It had enough toppings and it looked as expected as in the menu photos.

Charkha is an Indian Restaurant in the downtown w9th area of Cleveland, and it serves it good, authentic North Indian cuisine at a reasonable price. I've been to this place several times, and I usually really enjoy the food and service!

However, during my last visit, everything, well, sucked! The chutneys were watery, the Mango Lassi was pure ice and did not seem to have any Yoghurt in it, the Paneer Pakoras were luke warm, greasy as all hell, and seemed to have been Microwaved...

The Paneer Tikka (not tikka masala) was dry, unflavorful and was served with charred paneer and uncooked onions... Only saving grace was the Malai Koftas!

I'm chalking my last visit down to a night off - till now they have delivered usually good service, and one bad one.

First I'll say the service was great, the people that work there are really nice. 

Second, alot of people avoid this place because it looks completely ran down BUT in my past experiences some hole in the walls have been the best.

Now about the food. I'll start with the rice, I LOVE rice, I grew up on it, so I know when rice is cooked properly. The rice at wongs was horrible, it actually tasted like they cooked it in too much water and just drained out the remaining water. I usially finish my plain rice if nothing else but I took 3 bites and threw it out. 
The orange chicken actually tasted like real oranges with a very natural flavor, which I loved BUT non of the breading on my chicken was on my chicken! As I picked up each piece the breading would just slide off. The actual chicken left behind was tough and dry and the breading turned soggy in the thick orange sauce they filled half way up the box. NOT WORTH $9.

From September to January you screwed up my prescriptions AND screwed with my insurance by NOT paying attention to written prescriptions I gave to you. Personally. My schedule 3s....you IGNORED & didn't fill leaving yourself to scramble on a Saturday to fill them when you had a week to verify it. During that week you ignored my script, my health plan reset meaning instead of paying $00 for my scripts I had to pay full price bc my deductible hadn't been met. All you said was ""Sorry.""

I had foot surgery in September. I stood at the window with my foot in a boot & crutches and you had the nerve to ask my doctor why she wrote me for 2 schedule 3s and then asked which foot did I have surgery on. Not only are you a blind idiot....you're stupid, thinking YOU can violate HIPAA & then get bitchy with my doc when they refuse to violate HIPAA. You're a pharmacist, not my doctor. It's none of your business why I am written for a schedule 3, or for any other drug.

I found it a bit odd because you have to go up a few steps and the lower area was empty. 

The cost is pretty good, but at the same time, selection was minimal. I had looked at the menu items in the past and felt there was not that many options, and I was right. Pretty sure there is less selection here than Mandarin. Service was good, 2 waitresses and maybe the manager/owner, were all friendly.  Had to ask for refills, which is always a item on my list.

The Roberto Clemente Bridge (a.k.a. Sixth Street Bridge) makes up 1/3 of The Three Sisters, the industrial-looking yellow bridges clumped together near PNC Park.  Very noteworthy is the fact that the Clemente Bridge is closed to vehicular traffic before Pirates games so that fans can more easily and safely make their way across the river to PNC Park on foot, a truly great experience.

The service is impeccable, a standard of perfection to which all other restaurants should aspire.  That says a great deal about the manager, doesn't it?  Seated promptly, server arrived to take our drink order within one minute after being seated.  Drinks came out promptly.  Nice selection of beers on draught and a reasonable wine list - not great, but adequate.  Server was attentive throughout the meal, although she did not ask me if I wanted another beer or if my wife wanted another Margarita.  WE would not have ordered a second drink, but the server did not know that.  One should always be asked - revenue generator.  The food is delicious and well presented.  Pricing is as follows:  my wife's salmon dish, probably about 5-6 ounces of fish, was $28, her Margarita was $12, her dessert, a cheesecake dish, was $8.  My beer was $5 and my pork sandwich was $17, I think.  I must say that the ""home cut"" fries accompanying my sandwich were a bit of a disappointment, cut very much like shoestring potatoes, very thin and short.  I prefer my fries a bit more on the meaty side.  The ambiance is quite good, very pleasant.  Although on one website the restaurant more than hints about one's cell phone etiquette, suggested elimination of baseball caps, (particularly if one has not even a modicum of couth and wears the cap backwards like an ill bred, redneck slob), and general standard of dress, I still did see some men in the restaurant with shorts and t-shirts, generally against the restaurant's published dress code.

The highlight of Oriental House is everything in their Dim Sum section, a new addition to the menu after the restaurant changed owner in 2013. The steam pork bao or pork-crab bao is the best in town, and nowhere you can find real Chive Boxes (highly recommend) in a 100-mile radius. One of their chefs come from Norther Chinese city of Tianjin, which is know for flour-made cuisines like dumpling and baozi/bao. So they get some real stuff here.

The walls are wood-paneled and like everything else in Harlow's inspires thoughts of how the place could be updated for the modern age and keep the same cozy feeling. 

I suppose that should be the theme of this review--updating your restaurant. 

The food here tastes great, but it is very typical breakfast fare. Fried in vats of butter and oil without concern for the carbohydrate levels of you or your unborn child. Doesn't get much better for a fierce hangover, which will be promptly cured from the coma you'll slip in to after any of the specialty plates. 

One of drawbacks of this anachronistic beacon of breakfasts are the prices. Apparently adjusting for inflation was lost on the menu creator--a SIDE of hash browns costs four dollars, while two eggs and some hash browns will cost you ten bucks, but you get a drink with that. Don't forget 3 bucks for a cup of coffee. 

Like other users have mentioned, parking can be a pain when it's busy. They close at 2 PM, so here's a hint: go at 1 PM. 

If this review were based solely on the service it would be 4 stars, the staff was very friendly despite the fact that they only seem to hire women. The guy who cooks your food is a jolly looking rotund chef who knows how to fry an egg.

Now that I've outed myself as a Jew, let me just say that Kosher for Passover is one step above regular Kosher rules requiring no bread products, which usually means that the food is even blander than usual.  This may not seem possible after you've had a Kosher meal, but it turns out that the food tends to get even blander the more ingredients that are not allowed.  Somehow Havana is able to overcome the bland requirement to create the best kosher for Passover food I've ever had.  The brisket is good for several meals, and the dish with the eggplant and matzah is amazingly good even though there is no meat and it is not better than the brisket.  Besides, it's nice to have some more leftovers after I am done eating the leftover brisket.

But. . . how come the food at the restaurant isn't as good?  That just seems to be one of the mysteries of life that I have been unable to fathom after five visits.  The Kosher for Passover food is actually much better than anything I have ever ordered at the restaurant.

Well, not really. First of all, those guys jumped solo. Second of all, I wasn't robbing banks. Third, I landed in Boulder City, not near the beach.

Regardless, the experience was awesome. I walked into that place confident as can be. Then they have you sign the waiver telling you it's your fault if you die, lots of people get injured, lots of people break things, some people die. If you're ok with that, then you're clear. They teach you a really short lesson on how to jump, how to set up your body, how to land, and how to be safe all around. They also have you watch a quick video clip, where they (jokingly?!?) suggest you give your tandem guy a $500 tip for his hard work.

Once that's all done, they set you up in your jumpsuit and start getting you all harnessed up. Then you meet the guy you're jumping with (tandem jump) and you guys chat for a minute. After that, you board your shiny airplane, get harnessed in some more, and there you go. 

For whatever reason, I was expecting to be on the ledge of the plane and hearing ""3... 2... 1..."" and then falling. I mean, don't we always count down before crazy things like this? Not this time! I remember being on the edge, and then being in the air. That aside, the experience was amazing. Just falling like that was absolutely amazing, and the coolest thing I've ever done. It's such a rush that everything else fails.

Their doors finally opened and they've been pretty busy ever since. The inside is brand spankin' clean and they have tables you could potentially stay and hangout for a while or even study. 

Their drinks are actually pretty tasty and their boba is very good. Texture is just right and there's a bit of a flavor to it. They also have a variety of popping boba! You can order teas, slushes, or smoothies, and I believe if you buy 10 you get one free!

If you live in the area, like me, be prepared to become a regular. No longer do you have to drive out far to get a smoothie or boba.

Call me boba queen!",2018-04-10 00:00:29

I have been on a boba kick lately and even more since I have discovered is the various gels/jellies that are also available to mix into these wonderful drinks and smoothies. 
On this trip I decided on a Thai Tea slush with regular boba (they also have micro-boba) and Peach Snow (more of a smoothy) with mixed jellies (they come in various flavors). 
The thai tea was from a mix that had non-dairy creamer instead of milk but it was tasty and the boba cooked to perfection. The Peach Snow that I had saved for later was very tasty, and the mixed jellies were fun and chewy, but not as chewy as the boba, which I also like. Reminds me a lot of pieces of nata de coco (Philippine specialty that is cut into bite sized cubes and I love to eat straight out of the package/jar with chopsticks).

I thought the food was actually worth the price in hindsight.  

I hate to say it, but I did not enjoy the service as much as I did the food.  Our waitress asked if I was finished with my plate, when I obviously had a lot of shrimp left to eat.

French bread for $1 and baked cookies for $2. 

You can't talk about Walmart without mentioning their price match policy and their generous return policy. You don't even need the ad for a price match or your receipt for a return. Even though I have a general dislike of shopping here, it's those two policies that keep me coming back.

The hummus was super tasty and one of the best I've had. Pita bread was nice and warm (also they keep giving it to you with no extra charge).

We arrived just a little after noon and dining room was crowded.  We were seated quickly at one of the two open tables and began perusing the menu.

I chose the chicken salad sandwich with veggie casserole as my side.  One of my co-workers ordered the mojo chicken sandwich and the other ordered the egg roll appetizer as her entree.  Our food arrived fairly quickly (I don't believe it was more than 15 minutes).  I really enjoyed my chicken salad.  I am no fan of mayo and I was happy when my server had informed me that their salad did not use mayo.  The salad was accompanied by the veggie casserole.  I was happy to find the casserole was rather light with the veggies in a bechamel-type sauce with bread crumbs on top.  It was delicious.  My co-workers both enjoyed their meals as well.  

We decided to order dessert in part, because of what I had heard on yelp regarding the peanut butter pie.  But along with the pie, we also got the blackberry-peach cobbler.  The cobbler, by far, was the supreme dessert that day.  The peanut butter pie looked pretty, but it just didn't match up to the fruity goodness of the cobbler.

I went for some of their Greek lamb specials and it was decent.  I could tell the meal was made earlier in the day, but with something like a lamb or roast, that's to be expected.  The boss had their chicken and spoke highly of it, though I was busy trying to take down my own plate.  The little yelper had their spaghetti (one of his faves!) and when he was done with that, helped mommy and daddy finish their plates!  I'm sure if he could review them, it would be five stars (though he likes ANY food, like Mikey)!
We went to the Acropolis with friends late one evening, so we stayed for dessert.  OMG!  They have some really, REALLY good desserts; homemade cakes and other sweets.  They also serve S&D coffee; a local roaster (and my personal favorite, second only to D&D).
The service was a bit of an issue.  It wasn't too crowded, but I had a problem trying to get my drinks refilled and the inevitable new fork/spoon issue that comes with a 2-year old.  The lack of any sort of personality or helpfulness really brings this to 3 stars.  If they could fix that, it'd be just right!

Let's be honest... with car rental places, the bar is super low but this was exactly how all of the 'big name' places should aspire to be.  Just simple... go to a counter, get your car and go.  

I've been burnt so many times at this airport by the ""big name"" rental places; Thrifty, National, Hertz, etc... and I would have this time too, had I not booked with them.  I was absolutely leery about it, quite honestly.  I assumed they were some off-site random place.  NOPE... right in there with everyone else at the main rental row.

I'm getting ahead of myself...

So, all of the other big name places had huge lines like usual, which is why I wasn't going to rent a car this time, was just going to drive from LA.  However, I figured I'd give this company a shot and if it didn't pan out, I'd just start driving to Vegas (from LA).  

EZ had five people ahead of me in line - that's it, and it moved quickly.  The LAST thing you want to do when you get to Vegas is having to wait... and wait... and wait.  Get in the car and get to your fun.  With EZ Rent-a-Car?  I was in and out of there within 5-10 minutes.  The people in the 40 person line at the company next door looked longingly at us.  

Now... how they make their money.  The upsells... gas and coverage that EVERY rental company uses.  Any idiot knows that your car insurance company most likely covers a rental so don't get their coverage, which usually will exceed the price of your rental on its own.  Also, the pre-paid gas... why in the world would you do that?  You're not getting more than a four cylinder, most likely.   How far do you think you're going to drive and why can't you just hit one of the numerous gas stations near the airport!?  But with the upsells, this guy next to me was getting frustrated because he wasn't that bright and the guy at the counter was pretty pushy, honestly.  He was like, ""So, these are our coverage options... I'll put you down for this one.""  The customer was just nodding.  ""And our pre-paid gas amount is this... so your total is...""  Then the customer was shocked, ""Whoa, I expected it to be like $100-something, not $500-something.""  Then they went back and forth on how to get it down.  Um, to get it down, just decline that!!  

My guy at the counter was good.  Different temperament and when he was about to go into the sales pitch, I just said, ""I'm good with the insurance and gas"" and he was cool with it.  That's it.  Just know what you want and you're golden.

Anyway... this went a million times better than I imagined and the biggest plus was that they were right there at the main rental row, which I didn't know.",2014-06-19 22:42:00

I ordered via Just Eat. The food arrived hot, 10 minutes early.

After the disappointing Hakka Wow (who put wheat in pakoras) these guys did great. Not only were there 10 Pakoras for 5.99 (instead of 5 for 10.99, common in Indian joints), but they were GF and vegan - and came with a great coriander chutney. The bharta was special because I could taste that the eggplant was truly charcoal grilled. The dal had fresh tomato and was nicely spiced. I would have added fresh coriander, but thats ok. Aloo Gobi was also well done. You have to ask for dairy free bharta or they'll put butter in it. 

I wish there was a fresh salad, an option to buy a side of cut onions or other fresh veg, but I'm very pleased with what I received. I'd also get an air fryer so pakoras could be cooked without deep-frying (if that'd even work).

I've gone through 7 Indian restaurants on Just Eat in the downtown core and this one's at the top. It isn't Madhur Jaffrey's cooking (regrettably, nowhere is), but it's perfectly fine with GF vegan options. I'd order again.

It was several orders of magnitude better than Truly India where you could not pay me to eat. It was a lot better than Little India Restaurant.

My gifrleind and a friend all went to Kabuki for some Sushi because I had been craving it for a long while.  The last few times we've gone there it's always been a pretty good visit.  Quick service. Good food. 

We walk in and are seated.  It's a little crowded, but nothing we've seen before.  They have about 5-6 people waiting tables or hosting or doing something.  A waiter asks us for our drinks and I throw in an order of edemame and some belly buttons.  

..and the wait begins.

Id say it was bout 10-15min before our appetizers got in and the waiter felt the need to tell us the edemame was '""fresh!"" ... i guess that's lingo for ""It's gonna be a while.""  Finally they bring it along with the belly buttons.  During our wait we decided to put in our food order.  We got about three different types of sushi.  Nothing super fancy with a volcano exploding with fire shooting out the ends... just some regular sushi.

I kid you not, it was about 30min before my girlfriend could not hold back and finally asked the waiter why it was taking so long.   Apparently they had just two people before making sushi.  Well ya know what? We've been there before when just one guy was there and it was faster service.  We got our food finally, but instead of bringing it all at once, they brought two then one.  Ok fine... Im hungry.

We eat our food and get our bill..  The bill comes out to roughly $55.  With a tip we all decided to split the bill three ways.  Two of us had cards and put $22.00 on each and one had cash and did $22.00 so they had a tip.  Not rocket science right?  He walks away with our cards and cash and literally 10min later we all get up disgusted..  ""Can we have our checks to sign?""  The girl pipes in ""Oh they are right here.."" I guess they didn't think we needed to sign anything.  I saw my bill for $22 and put a slash through the tip and signed  and we walked out.  (remember.. we left the tip in cash).

So Saturday morning I check my banking online from my phone just as we were heading out of town.   A nice little note on my bank statement:

CHKCARDKABUKI SUSHI & PEORIA AZUS     $55.38 


What the!???   Why the hell was my card charged for the full bill.  Did they decide to go back and charge my card the full amount because we were unhappy with their service??

Disgusted we called them and supposedly they are taking care of it.  It's Monday morning (when banks do their normal run through) and my banking statement still shows the same.

Love the food Kabuki, but you lost three customers because of the poor service; and we will not be coming back.

Update.. they fixed my account, but the service was still snail slow that day.",2011-08-15 14:38:07

He brought them back to life. I did have a 30 minute wait and I was there as soon as they opened I was the first one at the door. They did have appointments though so I wasn't upset. I loved the color they had however a lot of their colors were dried out. Luckily I found the perfect color :) Anthony always kept a convo and he's a great business man.

I was tempted but avoided ordering one. I had an omelet with cheese, turkey bacon and vegetables. It came with toasted baguette that would have been better if it was hot, and hash browns that were not great. The omelet was very good though. It comes with juice too, which is nice. They let me substitute iced tea instead, which was very nice of them. 

The iced tea was bad! Cloudy and tasted off. I think it was Earl grey, which I usually love. 

Service was pretty good. In addition to servers checking on our table, the manager also checked on is. I probably should have told him the tea was bad, but I didn't want to get into it.",2016-11-30 21:29:31

I'm all about the food and drinks. I will say that it's a nice touch that guys get a blue colored menu and girls get a pink colored menu.

I suggested we come here because my friend used to be obsessed with Green Grotto's baked mochis. When I saw that this place had a mochi waffle, we decided to check it out.My friend and I both got waffles and I got a sweet potato latte because it sounded like something that only Cafe Princess offers. I enjoyed the sweet potato latte because it tasted like frothed ginger milk, albeit a tad too sweet. 


 Sadly, the moffle (their name, I didn't coin it) tasted very rice-y and the texture was sort of like chewing gum. It definitely didn't taste like a glutinous rice mochi. My friend called it awffle (like as in awful, not like awwww it's so cute-waffle).

I, on the other hand, ordered a nuts waffle and their regular waffle batter is delicious! It was light and fluffy and the nuts complemented the vanilla ice-cream and waffle well. The cookies n creme ice-cream tasted off though and I'm not sure if it's because of freezer burn or if this batch was weird. I don't think they make the ice-cream in-house either, in case we have any ice-cream aficionados reading this review.

I thought the experience here was OK. Would i come back again? Probably not....there's so many other dessert places and bubble tea shops to go to/try in this area!",2018-02-15 15:56:40

Everything about this place is intense, but comfortably so. The place is well decorated, which nice furniture, lighting, and music. Most of the time, the speakers and televisions are on a station called ""Melody Arabia"", which is apparently Dubai's infectious answer to MTV. Catchy stuff.

The crowd here is great; you'll see everything from college students here to try something different, to foreigners looking for an American take on what they enjoy at home. There is plenty of live entertainment, from your conventional DJ, to belly dancers to Ethiopian sitar players. OK, that last one is pretty weird, but it proves that the Hubbly Bubbly can culture you more than the vapid, dilapidated smoke lounges that imitate it.

The product itself is top notch, and can't be matched anywhere else. Sure, you can get Starbuzz at a few places, but will they make your bowl out of a watermelon? How about a pineapple?

Sashimi is fresh. Also they only charge 10% service charge (included in the bill) which I think is good. Some places overcharge. Service was decent but the waiting time for food was super long today.

Of course that means I no longer have coffee in the house.  Last night as I got home from work about 10:30 and knew I would have to be up at 4:30 I realized a kick was in order. Earlier this year this Dunkin' Donuts opened just down the street from me where a Del Taco used to be.  Only a few steps away from a Charbucks I made it my choice for the next morning.  I checked online to make sure they would be open by 5:30 only to find the open at 4AM.   Who the heck functions in the open at that time of the night?  Any way I pulled in about 1/4 to 6 and found a light steady stream of customers inside and in the drive through.

QwoYmHz3hrI1C69DVkVXtw,wZdO2jOHr9O8sRC9799GTQ,CxEk19RBwfD0Ochgo4Q5UA,1,3,1,0,"This was my first time here. Once again, it was the weekend and I came to the nearby library to study. I was actually planning to go to Yummi's hamburger for lunch but for some reason I couldn't find it. Instead I went to this burger joint instead. I'm full and my stomach and satisfied, but that's about it. 

I think this is a family own business. The decor is nice, clean, friendly. The menu is really small. They have a few burgers ranging in different sizes, a few sandwiches, and a few sides I think as well. Today I ordered the chef burger (7-8 oz patty) and fries. They don't have a combo deal here, so you got to order everything separately. My meal came out to be 13 bucks today. 

The burger first of all was dry and not seasoned. I think I could've got a better burger anywhere else. They ALMOST didn't toast my bun either. I really don't like eating a hot and cold hamburger. The person making my burger said it came out of the oven I think but it definitely didn't look toasted and hot from where I was standing. I asked him if he could toast it for me and he did. There are a basic selection of veggies, and sauces you would see on a regular burger you get at home or a family BBQ. I don't usually go out and eat for places like this. 

The fries were probably the worst. Not crispy, and they also forgot about my order (I had to remind them I ordered fries). They were not seasoned at all, so I had to bring out the salt shaker. Even if I tried, I couldn't find a compliment for the fries. Eventually it got so bad that I had to take out the ketchup (I usually don't like using ketchup) and dip the fries in it so that I could get a change in flavour. 

I think lack of passion is the problem with this place. Food is a business but just like everything else in life, you need to be passionate about what you do. In fact, in a customer-oriented business like a restaurant, lack of passion really reflects in the quality of service and FOOD most importantly. 

If I wanted this kind of burger I could've just made it at home by myself with some patties from Costco and some store bought sauces. I didn't have to bike 20 minutes to go there. Anyways, unless they're willing to make a change in the near future I'm not planning to come back.

You can give this place a shot, but I warned you.",2015-06-13 18:55:58
FpgbqkbzXAotAs13vRyoaQ,y9kug1sTnidFKQ6zepFf2A,9cOrfyag5ULqygrKq8pvjQ,1,8,0,1,"Ok, I was like everyone else, read all the great reviews and was sure I'd have a great experience, yet that was far from the truth.

Our first experience was a cut and style with Nikki. I say our, because it was my teenage daughter getting the cut and style. We usually go to Tony and Guys located at Arrowhead, but this salon was closer and we had a gift card to use. So I was anticipating a great job, based on the reviews! What my daughter got was too much chopped from her crown which made her face look rounder and she looked older. She wanted something more edgier, more hip. She did not get that here, even though she kept telling Nikki it wasn't quite right. I think this salon is used to doing ""certain"" type cuts and styles, not the stuff Tony and Guy can achieve. So she left sad and embarrassed, anyone that has had a bad cut and didn't get what they were hoping for can understand the feeling. 

So...lastly we are left with the nail review. I still had money to use on my gift card, so I decided to do something nice for myself. I made an appointment with Misty, the ONLY nail technician at Salon de Chevoux. I wanted gel nails and sadly there were only a few colors to choose from. I wasn't impressed with her station, it was pretty dirty looking and I almost thought she was going to use a dirty file from the ""dirty tool"" container, but she put it back and grabbed a clean file. Whew! So, we chat, she seems nice, but I was looking around for a pedicure chair since she also does pedicures, and could not locate one! I asked where the chair was (that most nail salons have) but they did not have one!!!  I guess all she does, is whip out her portable foot jacuzzi, as you sit in a regular chair. Wow, glad I didn't make an pedicure appointment. The downside of having one technician is, you can't get your nails done with a friend or daughter! Since you'd have to take turns, turning a 30 minute appointment into an hour or more!! 
Soooo, she finishes my gel nails, I go to pay using my Gift card, but the cashier lady doesn't include Misty's tip. So I have no cash on me and I feel bad to not leave her anything, so they try to figure out how to add a tip. I'm in a hurry to go, had a son to pick up from school, so I decided I'd just buy something from the Dermalogica line. Of course it's overpriced but at this point I don't care, I just want to leave. So I used up the 70$ on my gift card just so I could leave and not ever come back!! I have to say, although the girls seem pretty nice, I am not impressed with any of their services! 

FWI: my gel nails started peeling off 2 days later!! I'm not picking at them either, they did it all by themselves! I finally got them redone somewhere else and let me tell you, it was a whole different experience! 2weeks later their still holding up strong and the only problem is, is that their growing out and I need to get them done again!",2014-01-30 01:26:53

bKeS32SW7MPDfbvHAmjsPg,fjNNUJS0dtMr7W0hHMiNVw,CamwTepsSxknKMtTXR5kSg,2,3,0,0,"This is a good cheap all-day breakfast bacon and eggs place. I think it's something like $5 for the simple bacon, eggs, home fries, and toast and so you can't go wrong. Especially since most other ""all day breakfast"" places in Brampton close at like 3pm.

Unfortunately, it is not much more than a good cheap breakfast place. I don't recommend ordering anything too ambitious. It will all be edible but everything I've ordered (burgers, fish and chips, etc.) have been very meh. Everything is cheap though so even if it's not great you don't feel like you've wasted too much. Their Greek items (soulvaki, for example) are a step above meh. They're like Meh+.

A few annoying pet peeves:
- They used to have jugs of ice water. They now flat out refuse to give you water. Like I asked for water after buying a meal and was told they sell water but do not give out cups of water. I am not even sure if this is legal. Which I brought up to her. She said it was. Regardless, it is water. How do you deny that to your customer? Could you BE any more obtuse?
- The ordering style is odd. You order at the counter and are then served at your table. But you also have to get your own condiments, cutlery, napkins, you name it. Oh and the cutlery is literally from Dollarama. Like it could not be worse quality. How bad can cutlery be that it's even notable you ask? Oh, you'll see.
- The tables at each booth are weirdly narrow. I've never seen anything like it. The booths themselves seem to be always moving so they're never set up in a straight line in any way which causes the whole restaurant to look messy.

I would've rated it 3* for a consistent simple and okay breakfast but I dunno... I prefer to go to places who won't nickle and dime me over a glass of water.",2013-08-25 05:25:49
PZJ0x30wdYkBCxXYIpUBxw,cUq1UjPVSJxTZgVFe9raUA,szGbmw_vq3kVU4SfK1x6Sw,4,4,5,1,"This place is number one in the holy beef book of my parents and extended family.  Ruth's Chris is nice, but still a steakhouse chain.  It's ""Pittsburgh fancy"".  As a non-eater of cow, everyone is slightly confused on why this place is one of my favorites, but between the service, the bar, and the dessert, it's difficult to find something you don't like.

I usually opt for a bottle of moscato, but last opportunity, I ordered the peach pear martini.  It was light, but had a real pear flavor--not that perfume one that happens way too often.  You receive the entire shaker which is exciting (or sad that it excites me), almost always there is little bonus drink left.  The +1 had an ""In Fashion"":  pretty much an old fashioned with an orange liquor.  For a glass of mostly spirits, it was made well.

Again, I cannot vouch for the steak. 95% of those in my party cleared their steak plates (with only one slight complaint from Mr. N who had a little tiff that his butter did not sizzle for long enough, but that's a whole different issue).  They apparently do it well, with LOTS of butter.  Speaking of butter, they also cook their chicken (my main go to) in these heaps of fat, and it is the best thing that has ever happened to that bird.  I've never had chicken elsewhere as tender as this.  A bird with the consistency of a beef filet (at least what I remember) is only found at Ruth's Chris.  Don't forget you order the sides separately, and that is where they get you.  Do not order a side for every person.  You will have multiple boxes of mashed potatoes and an extra forty bucks on your bill.

Most importantly, you gotta order dessert here.  It may look lame  with basic berries and cream, crème brulée, ice cream, etc. ""Where is the bourbon salted caramel and hibiscus pate de fruits?"" In Lawrenceville, probably.  But that doesn't mean the staples here aren't just as rich and delicious.  To be totally honest, I come here for the crème brulée. Vanilla bean custard under that torched sugar top and a side of berries is all I need.

To prove the real reason this place is great, a tidbit of the N family being a total mess.  Last visit we managed to break two wine glasses and spill a water (it was my sister, I swear), causing a commotion which required two servers, a busboy, tablecloths, and a new cocktail to help us get our lives together.  And the service remained great for the rest of the meal. I know most places of this old man meat club genre would not have appreciated this to the point of scorn for our table.  But no, this isn't stuffy enough for that somehow.  Good drinks, incredible desserts, and not nearly as much frou frou as other similar spots. I hear the steak is all right too.",2015-03-23 16:30:18

The food has gone downhill for me though. If you don't like rootbeer or candied things in your savory meal, then you'll have a hard time finding something here. If you are really hungry and have only about ten bucks to spend, you'll also have a really hard time. The food really is well prepared and creative and unusual, but prices of 12 dollars and up for tapas size portions of food are not for everyone. They have really awesome rosemary tater tots. But you better chew slowly, since they are about a dollar a tot. Burger sliders and ribs come without a side. And the actual burger and open-faced sandwiches that were decent portions are now not on the menu anymore. 

Heist fills a void in Charlotte - the brewery that also offers food. But I can think of any number of places to have a better meal for the amount of money spent here, and I don't really plan to spend big when I go to a brewery. Obviously, other people feel differently, the place tends to be pretty crowded.

A word on Wednesday night trivia - not great. There is only a prize for first place (25$), not one of second and third like other places to.

After finally making it to the doorway, we were asked to come in by the hostess, only to be left inside the doorway with no real inclination of whether we should proceed to one of the several open tables or wait.  When we finally tracked down the hostess again, she said we needed us to wait to sit down as to, ""not upset the chef.""

Fast forward, and we've finally sat down (in the seat Tom Cruise filmed Jack Reacher nonetheless).  After attempting the scan the entirely too complex menu (do you really need multiple versions of what is essentially the same dish?), we settled on the breakfast burrito, the seafood benedict, the seafood omelette (same as the seafood benedict, just with the bread on the side instead of under) and the apple pancake sundae (figured go big or go home).

Within about fifteen minutes, the burrito, benedict and omelette were brought out.   By this point, out entire party was starving and I told everyone to go ahead and get started (the server said my pancakes would be another minute).  Overall, each were about the most stereo-typically bland diner food you could ever get.  But, fast forward twenty minutes...  still no pancakes (and everyone else has finished).

Once the server finally made it back around, she mentioned something in passing about the apples on the pancake and left again (we had no idea what she said).  After another five minutes or so, my pancakes finally came out, and by this point, ready to leave, I succumbed to hunger and dove in.

Bland... bland... bland... and an associated stomach ache from the pure sugar rush.  After chewing through about half the plate, I gave up on it (I almost never leave food on the plate).  Ready to go, we asked for the check, with the one saving grace that redeemed Deluca's from one star being the server proactively taking the pancakes off of our tab.

Check this off the list as a one and done.",2014-04-30 01:13:27

I ordered the Reuben with thousand island dressing, but I never could understand what he was saying - it may have been options for the meat.  I think I got corned beef, which wasn't very flavorful.

I can't really comment on wait times for a table, as I usually come by my poor lonesome self and sit at the counter with a magazine or the paper, but there is usually no wait for the counter.  The staff is fast and attentive, almost immediately getting my drinks as I sit down.  They have a couple of televisions above the counter, one on sports and the other on news.  Each table and counter seat has a flip egg for when you need service.  The egg with the smiley face on it (it's actually a pretty creepy smiley face, the kind of face that says ""hey baby wanna leave with me tonight?"") means everything is well.  The egg with the frowny, constipated looking face means you need attention, and the one time I had to use this they were extremely quick to respond.  

Most of them items on the menu have eggs (dur), and the portions are very large.  Omelets are made with four eggs instead of three.  I usually order the Three Pigs, which is an omelet with cheese (usually order without it though to decrease the fattiness), sausage, ham and bacon, served with either fried potatoes and toast or banana nut muffin.  The Omelet itself is amazingly delicious and the potatoes tasty with this seasoning they drizzle over it.  I usually order toast, as I really don't care for the banana nut muffin.

Random quirk: The door to the bathroom is built to look like an outhouse!  Cute looking, but still retaining the functionality of modern plumbing!

The food is a bit pricey, but you generally get what you pay for.  If you live in the southwest part of the valley, you owe it to yourself to check this gem out.

PROS:
Eggs, eggs, and more eggs!  Big portions for you egg lovers
Fast and attentive and friendly wait staff.
Flip egg so you can call for service without looking awkward

CONS:
A bit pricey.

ygOqwSP20pttX76MPUe3rw,ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,gZf3RWyaydT8bAK5yw-5xQ,5,7,5,4,"Upstairs is Montreal's finest jazz venue and one of the city's local gems. Its a small and intimate, a perfect spot for any date and a fun way to spend an evening sipping on drinks, grabbing a bite, and listening to some of the best live music in the area. 
 
Joel Giberovitch opened this neat little jazz joint nearly 20 years ago, which has gained a notable amount of popularity, especially in the last decade. His inspirations from his past  trips to legendary New York jazz are an obvious influence in the makeup of his decor, which include wooden panels, brick walls, a lengthy yet cozy bar, and classy linens draping each table. If that doesn't establish the mood, I don't know what does. Seating is tight of course, but group dining is very possible here; I would highly recommend reservations.

Though it's been touted as a fun lunch spot, I'm more of a fan during their showcase nights which happen every Friday and Saturday. There is usually a cover charge before midnight, which was about $5 last time I checked. Groups of 4 or more are almost guaranteed a wait, but if you don't listen to jazz often, then take it like a champ and wait it out.

If the music isn't worth it (but of course it is), then consider the food and the drinks. Much of the menu is distinctly American, with quite few dishes named after notable states in the South, the birth place of jazz. Another portion of the menu is tapas, which is more bar food (nachos, quesadillas, fries, etc.) than they are classic Spanish small plates. I've enjoyed their food overall, as I've had good results with their pappardelle verona, their New Orleans filet mignon, and their array of tasty burgers. Try any of their martinis or get a wine to be paired with the food.

Then of course there's the music. Live jazz doesn't have to be during Montreal Jazz Festival, it can be had here on a much more casual level. The music has always taken precedence and has been a treat every time. I could probably not even eat anything and just sit to enjoy the performances, which vary from a wide range of local and visiting musicians.

I think very highly of this place and hope it continues to do well. I haven't gone to Montreal as often lately and want Upstairs to keep the drinks flowing and the music going. If only I could write their name upside down (see pics for reference).",2012-01-11 07:57:14

Duck buns, bok choy dumplings and the fried rice were all good. Also, the chairs in this plae are hard to move around, ESP at the bar, and make a ton of noise.

For those unfamiliar with the chain, its a chain of sports restaurants based around ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson of Black Sox fame.  This location is mature having been here for over 10 years.  It was renovated within the last year to make the interior much brighter and airy.  A welcome change to the dark persona of a lot of sports bars.

We were seated promptly, and our orders were taken fairly quickly.  My daughter had the kids pizza with, fries and apple slices.  She must have been happy with hers as the pizza was in her belly in 10 minutes flat, as were the apple slices.  The fries tasted like fries but neither of us was too interested in them.

I had the Baja Chicken sandwich with a side of Quinoa.  My sandwich was pretty good, but a little gooey.  I think if they omitted the mayonaisse it could have been great!  The avacado provided a nice summery taste.  The quinoa had a couple of issues.  I think that they prepared a big batch of Quinoa then just spoon it into the bowl and heat it under the salamander.  I say this because the top layer was crunchy, and the rest of it was moist - the way I expect it to be.  I didn't get to fully enjoy the Quinoa as my daughter decided it was rice and went to town on it, consuming about 1/4 of it and putting another 1/4 all over the table and booth.

For dessert she had the kids bubblegum ice cream sundae.  That was a treat and a half.  A scoop of bobblegum ice cream in a waffle bowl with whipped cream, gummy bears and candy sprinkles on the side.  The sides were very plentiful and we even had enough gummy bears to bring home for later.",2013-03-25 13:59:48

SERVICE - You have to make a purchase before you can sample the flavors. The wait for our gelato was about 15 minutes because the guy ahead of us ordered four large cups. Angelita was the girl scooping and she was scooping as fast as she could so not her fault. 

FOOD
Salted Butter Caramel - This was good. Very distinct buttery caramel flavor. 

Hazelnut - I love hazelnut so I throughly enjoyed this flavor. It was very tasty! 

Chocolate Hazelnut - Tasted like Nutella so if you're a Nutella fan, this is a good choice. 

Biscotti - Tasted like gingerbread cookies. I like that it has cinnamon/cookie crumbles throughout the gelato. 

Affogato - My husband got this with sweet milk gelato. This flavor was a bit icy compared to the rest.

ujMcxx-EzqTHht2ZtsiQ1w,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,HOGdBz2w9VZbw2yyM-WA3g,5,16,1,9,"The High Park neighbourhood is near-void of good places to grab a pint. Well, it was until The Mugshot Tavern opened anyways... The Mugshot easily provides the perfect answer to filling that void, and then some. Truly nice owners, delicious food, and a killer environment, this place takes the neighbourhood bar way beyond what it's expected to be.

If the Mugshot doesn't have the best draft selection in a 10 km radius, it certainly has the most well-thought-out one. These guys obviously love beer, and more obviously is that they've put a ton of thought into what is being pulled from the taps. It's all craft beer, and some interesting stuff at that. Chances are they have a few you've never even heard of, like the King Pilsner and Warthog Ale. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that they're probably one of only a handful of places in the city with either on tap. Don't expect to find Canadian or Blue here; what they offer is much more creative than any of that stuff.

The food, and the entire menu for that matter, is equally well-thought out. It's a killer mix of Southern-soul and comfort food, and they do a dam fine job of pulling it off. You can expect to find Southern favorites, like fried chicken with fritters, and some not so expected ones, like in-house-made corn dogs with chutney. The presentation is pretty decent too and again, goes beyond the typical bar stuff. It's pretty obvious that the people manning the kitchen know what the hell they're doing back there. Rarely do I go to a restaurant and have difficulty deciding what to order; at The Mugshot I was torn between a few items.

They've done a dam good job of ridding the place of all remnants of the defunct McKenzies that used to take up the place. They've clearly spent a lot of time, thought, and energy turning it into something completely new. The environment, painted in bright red and tactfully covered in old-school, famous mugshot photos, is easily the kind of space you could hang out for a long, long time. It's comfortable and welcoming, the way a neighbourhood local should be. Despite not being an overly large place, it still accommodates nicely, and any excess people can spill onto their cozy rooftop patio.

And the staff at Mugshot? They couldn't be any friendlier. Having only been open about a week or so, you'd never know it by their attitudes. Likely working long hours, round-the-clock, getting the place ready and established, they're still sociable, out-going, and friendly. I sure-as-hell didn't feel like a stranger in this joint, and I don't think anyone with even the teeniest bit of personality would either. Even coming in by yourself is sure to get you some conversation.

It's clear that, after just opening, they're still trying to establish their crowd. It's still sorta random as to the people that might be in there. While one day the bar could be full of seniors, that evening it could be packed with a younger crowd. It seems to be dependent on the time of day, but it's also, unfortunately, the way the neighbourhood seems to work. Customers are sorta like family; you can't really pick 'em.

The Mugshot isn't just the kind of place you sit, drink, and hide from the world, although it provides that pretty well; it's also the kind of place that you can unexpectedly get some truly imaginative and delicious food in a comfortable and welcoming space. In a neighbourhood like High Park, The Mugshot Tavern is unrivaled in every respect.",2011-07-18 10:56:06

Stayed here over NASCAR weekend back in March...not that I knew it was NASCAR weekend at the time...

Stayed in a GO Room on the 18th floor. While I didn't have a Strip View, I had a view of the pool and habitat areas, which was equally as good. Got a deal on it too...around $86.50 avg/night with my Total Rewards discount! It didn't have a tub as I was hoping but those seem to be a dime a dozen...sometimes you get one, most of the time you don't.

Arrived at around 2pm on a Thursday and check-in didn't take all that long, maybe like 20 minutes. They also have automated machines at the front desk if you're looking to avoid the lines. I did see some long lines at the front desk at certain times of the day though.

Enjoyed the vibe of the hotel and the casino...even if the slot machines were tight as hell. Thankfully, you can access the Strip from the casino in less than 5 minutes, and wonderful joints such as O'Shea's and Harrah's were very very close. It's also connected to the Monorail if you're looking to head to MGM Grand or casinos located further north.

Everything you need under one roof, definitely. I also recommend Margaritaville and Burger Joint if you're looking for some eats, but there's a lot of other joints... like LA Subs, Johnny Rockets, and the Buffet (which I didn't get to try this time around.)

Loved the bartenders over at Bugsy's Bar. They were pretty heavy-handed with the booze and kept the drinks coming while playing VP. Was a great spot to just chill, smoke, and lose a little cash.

They need to fix the elevators in the parking garage though. I swear, they must've been as old as the hotel. I was heading back to my rental on the 6th floor one day and the lights just went out...like hell.",2011-08-15 01:41:49

Entrance is right on Hoover St through double doors marked with numbers 140 & 150.  There's also always a crowd outside which makes finding this place easier if it were your first time.

Aesthetically, one of the best bars in downtown that makes me feel as if I escaped from the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas soon as I stepped inside!! Library-like setting with walls decked floor to ceiling of bookshelves and comfortable Victorian-esque furnitures scattered throughout.

DJ was actually spinning great house music unlike that typical EDM they play at any nightclub south of Charleston.  That being said, it'd be nice if they didn't have the volume cranked up that loud.  If we wanted to go to a club, we would have.  I feel as if the vibe was ruined since it was quite difficult to keep a conversation going.

I appreciate the fact that this joint is actually smoke free.  Usually, that's a plus since you don't walk out of this place smelling like a chimney, however, there seems to be more people outside smoking than people inside the lounge so it was almost empty most of the time we were there!!

Lunch has a build your own bowl concept that allows you to choose between noodles, stir fry, chilled noodles and rice. If you choose stir fry or chilled noodles you are ready to move on to your next step. If you select the rice option you need to decide if you want Fried or Steamed Rice, and also select between White and Brown. If however you choose the noodles section, you open yourself up to a few more options starting with noodle: Udon / Ramen / Gluten Free and continuing with the broth: Pork / Dashi (Veg) / Chicken. Once these decisions have been made you are ready to select your protein: Pork Belly / Lemongrass Chicken / Duck / Steak / Shrimp / Tofu. There is also a section for Veggies: Carrots / Mushrooms / Bean Sprouts / Bok Choy / Snow Peas / Broccoli / Bamboo Shoots. Finally there are a few extras you can add: Egg / Kimchi Pickled Ginger. The Bowls start at $5, Proteins are $3, Veg is $1 and Extras are $.50. We ordered two Noodle Bowels, one with Udon Noodle, Pork Broth, Pork Belly, Broccoli, Mushrooms, and an Egg. The broth was lovely--creamy and mouth coating, full of flavor, but still rather lite for a ramen pork broth. Noodle were good, as was the pork belly. Veggies were spot on and the egg was perfectly cooked--soft with a slightly runny center.

While we were still planning the options for are aforementioned bowls the server came by to explain the menu. First world famished as we were, we took the opportunity to order the Crispy Pig Face Dumplings with House Siriracha, Kimchi, and Scallions and the Goat Cheese & Roasted Beets with Miso Cashew Purée, and Daikon Sprouts from the Small Bites section of the menu. The Small Bites came out soon after we placed our order for the bowls, and were wonderful! We loved the house made sriracha!...the dumpling were full of flavors and depth with a nice contrast from the kimchi and scallions. The Goat Cheese & Roasted Beets were good, but they came with an exceptional (probably crack laced) miso cashew purée. The purée had the consistency of hummus and was so amazing that we would have taken jars of it home with us if was for sale.

I wasn't really planning on drinking, but it was readily evident that was a strong cocktail and drink program at the Clever Koi, so I took the occasion to order their Sloe Burn, made of Old Charter 8Yr / Plymouth Sloe Gin / Basil / Thai Bird Honey / Lemon. The menu describes it as spicy, with hints of cherry, anise + oak. I was thoroughly impressed with the balance of acid, sweet, heat, and alcohol. It made a great accompaniment to our enjoyable meal.

I think we came in right after they opened. We experienced a quiet lunch in a beautiful space. I can imagine Clever Koi becoming quite loud for dinner or evening drinks however. I don't think I'd enjoy that nearly as much, but as long as the kitchen can keep up, I would anticipate the food and drinks to be great.",2016-09-15 23:11:12

The idea is a great.  Custom-made salads where you can see them make it in front of you, or you can choose one of their regular options.  They also do sandwiches here.

I went with the Crisp Cobb which came with a Dijon dressing.  I watched for a while as they made it but I think they went a bit overboard on the dressing.  I should have asked for it on the side.

The cashier said it would be the best salad I ever tasted.  Ok, well it wasn't.  It wasn't bad but I've had better salads elsewhere in Charlotte.  The bacon was too hard, it hurt my teeth.  The eggs were good.  I would have liked a lighter dressing and it seemed lacking on other vegetables...tomatoes, cukes, etc.

It was worth trying and if I'm in the area again, I'll try to increase my rating for Crisp.  Maybe next time I'll try something different that will be ""the best salad I ever tasted"".",2011-12-09 19:41:35

So the groomer was ordered to stop all work, charge the owner only for a bath, convince the owner to pick her dog up, and personally hold the dog until the owner arrived.

I think it's fitting to give this place a score of ""Meh, I've experienced better"" because I have indeed experienced better, right here at this exact same location!  Let me explain.  Eclipse Fitness was a small quiet gym which did very little advertising and seemed to survive based on a loyal membership base and some word of mouth.  This fall, Goodlife purchased the two-location chain and quickly converted it to a Goodlife-branded location.  I have no doubt that this was a good business move for Goodlife.  For such a huge chain, not having a location at Yonge and Eglinton was surely a significant gap.

When Goodlife took over, they made some immediate improvements.  A significant amount of equipment (including all the free weights) was replaced with new stuff.  The place was painted and the floor was re-done.  It looks great.  Unfortunately, I've also observed the following changes:
- Not surprising since most Goodlife members have a membership that allows them to go to any location, the gym is now much, much busier.  I used to be able to go at any time I wanted (including a Monday at 6 PM) and not feel crowded.  Now, sometimes you can't even find a few square feet to do some pushups, without feeling like you might be stepped on.
- I used to almost always be greeted with a ""Hey Terry!"" as I walked in.  The personal touch is now lost, as I'm one of 750,000 members (across Canada).
- The gym is dirty.  Ok, it's not filthy, but Eclipse had a cleaning staff of 3-5 people in the gym most evenings, and the place was spotless.  Now I sometimes see one cleaner, sometimes.  The mats and exercise balls have a permanent layer of dust over them from people wearing their outside shoes in the gym, towels are scattered around, etc.

Despite my complaints, I still think this is a decent gym, as long as you have some flexibility in your schedule and can go outside the peak evening hours.  The equipment is up-to-date, the prices are reasonable, and for the most part the staff are friendly.",2012-02-15 00:14:44

I had been to the Aveda academy in Toronto, which is apparently known as one of the better academies. I called Tonic and the receptionist was very attentive, and didn't rush the call, as alot of others would have done when a customer is trying to decide something. The receptionist suggested a stylist (Anka) for my type of hair (short) and I went with it. 

My experience at Tonic was very different compared to the Aveda in Toronto. Maybe it's because a student was cutting my hair in Toronto and a teacher was cutting it in Montreal, but I felt a lot more at ease and calm at Tonic. At the Toronto location, it felt like they were always trying to sell their products. At the Montreal location, the focus is on YOU and your hair. Anka showed me a lot of useful styling techniques and shared with me what she wanted to dabble with for my next visit. 

The price was very reasonable ($55 + $10tips) for a head massage, wash, cut, and style. As well, they touch up your make-up afterwards to make sure you don't have random strands of hair on your face. All in all, I'm very happy with Tonic and I will be going back again.",2010-09-12 22:09:08

With the top down, beautiful 70 degree weather in March, went to Roccos, mentally tasting what i was gonna order.  When we got there, a line quickly developed, who knew that at 2 pm everyone else in Summerlin had the same idea?  The very friendly 2-person staff was kept quite busy. We each ordered a 2-slice combo with a drink, pepperoni and sausage.  While we waited, I added the cucumber tomato salad with gooey balls of italian mozzarella for myself.  What the heck, i knew i wouldn't be hungry for dinner later.  The salad was luscious, and drenched with a homemade dressing that was just enough tang, but not too much to wilt the crunch of the veggies.  The meal was delivered outside where we sat in the sun.  Perfect, right?  Perfect for me, but my date took one look at it and exclaimed, I can't eat that, it's full of grease and I'll be sick for a week if I do.  Crestfallen, but still hungry, I suggested returning it to be made with less oil (and more ala pizza hut style,  which means yuckky to me). He said no, and sat there, bemoaning the money that I SPENT not him on the meal.  I suggested that he try the Aloha Hawaiian bbq next door.   He said no way.  So...I ate with or without him.  Glory behold, he decided to try the pizza, and remarked, this is actually really good!  Yey, total conversion.  No sickness, and he even said ""I'd like to try this place again!""

I'm told by another casual diner at Roccos that they import their mozzarella, and make their own sausage. I believe it. The pizza crust was slightly crunchy and perfect.

Picture the biggest beer castle ever. From the floor to the ceiling. Yes, gloriously tacky is a wonderful description.

The music her was mostly country and rock. Sorry, Lady Gaga fans. The crowd was very mixed. It seems many people from many different backgrounds come here to bask in Monkey Pants' soft, tacky glow. The drinks specials were good, the waitstaff was very attentive, and they had many TVs with various sports events on.

This place in like a most cafeterias. It takes a second to realize what you're supposed to do but it's easy. 

So first glance when you walk into the place, you'll see a large glass case with some replicas of the meals that you can get. In the entrance there was a stand with a menu and the process of which you're gonna go through.

I grabbed a tray and went in line. You're first checkpoint is a person behind the counter that asks what you want. I ordered a mini katsu curry. Most of the Udon dishes can be assembled right there in front of you but in my case I was handed a beeper. Since this was my first time I asked the person who took my meal order and he told me that when the beeper went off I would have to come up to the cashier and pick up my meal.

After he took my order, I went down the line grabbing some tempura pieces and a spam onigiri. Then I took a seat after everything was paid for. The wait was very short. When my beeper went off I got up but it turns out they just bring it to your table. 

Food:
The mini katsu was very fresh. Still steaming by the time it got back to me. The breading on the curry came off fairly easily and the seasoning on it wasn't amazing but the taste of the curry made up for it. The mini was a good portion for someone like me who doesn't eat to much. I loved the tempura. I got sweet potato, fishcakes, and shrimp. it was crispy and nice from the first bite. Lastly, I was surprised to learn that they make their Onigiri In house. It was a nice experience overall.

**Little secret someone told me... If you want your pick of the Onigiri then go there when Lunch starts or when they just open for dinner. They only make a certain amount every day.",2018-01-05 07:56:41

I was dragged here by a gf who loves Brew Tea and after my 3rd visit, I didn't want to come back. I never really found a milk tea drink that I liked from here despite adjusting the sweetness down. I told Sou I didn't like their milk tea, Hokkaido milk tea and brew tea so he suggested jasmine milk tea, less sweet. I told him I would think about it and he went ahead and made me a sample! I was immediately hooked. 

The jasmine milk tea is STRONG. It has a very strong tea taste to it, which I love. It was aromatic and perfect in terms of sweetness. Thanks Sou, I can't wait to be back!

Their Hokkaido milk tea is on the sweet side, so if you don't like super sweet I would recommend adjusting it down to a level 3 or even a 2.

Room = their capacity, not whether there is room in the venue. Often there will be loads of room just not compared to the capcity. Depending on the line waiting could be 30-60min which sucks.

We have not had Thai food in a long while and I had seen some great YELP reviews so we decided to venture away from our normal eating habits in the area and try this lovely restaurant. We arrived and it was swarming with people and the place was buzzing. We got one of the last seats at a small table and were given menus and had our drink order taken. You can tell this was going to be an excellent meal by how busy it was and many seemed to be regulars. The wait staff was quite personable with the guests and we looked forward to ordering. We went with a simple plan of a thai beef jerky appetizer, sticky rice, Chicken Pad Thai, and Pork fried Rice. The Jerky was actually more tender than expected from previous bad experiences at other Thai spots. There was a slightly spicy marinade and a very spicy dipping sauce. Not sure what was in it but it was yummy. The Pad Thai was also ordered to a not spicy feel. Thinly sliced noodles with bits of egg, bean sprouts and green onions. Crispy sprouts and flavor filled noodles that I was gobbling up like it was my last meal. The Pork rice was relatively standard and quite filling and a good portion.I did like how the flavored the pork with a sour following taste after the initial bit. Sort of a Pork adobo  feel. 
I must also mention a portion of the menu has a fully Vegan area to it. Unsure if the Vegan is prepared wholly separate or not. However the selection was vast in comparison to most Vegan selections. I guess with Vegan in your title you better deliver. 
Thank you for dining at Thailicious Authentic Thai & Vegan. We took our stuff to go since we had so much  left over, and it was just as good the next day.

Bad server is a bad server. Give you an example. An appetizer means, small dishes served before your main menu. My appetizer came after the main menu. When the customer's soda is empty, the server could ask if you would like a refill or purchase another drink. I had to flag my server every time I needed a drink. I have a 4 year old with me, she has not perfected her chopsticks skills, so a very good server will provide a to go plastic or spoon without me requesting one. In this case I had to.

If the food is taking a little bit longer no problem, servers usually try to bs that the kitchen is a little busy and the server would probably change the subject by conversing with customer.

My husband (then boyfriend) and I actually visited the NYC location prior to its closing in 2012. I remembered loving their spiced chicken sweet potato hash. I decided to order it again and honestly it was better than I remembered! Every component was beautifully assembled and perfectly made.    I way overate the meals prior (and of course there was the famed bread basket) yet I polished my plate clean! I did however wish my entree was a little warmer. 

Tiger shrimp tamale - tbh i was a bit disappointed and thought this dish was just okay. The sauce was really salty and the tamale reminded me of the remnant of their corn muffins. Definitely not worth the $19. I probably would be happier if I had ordered a second spiced chicken hash. 

A side of grits - their grits deserve a paragraph of its own. Not sure what they add into it but the texture + the spice + the flavor were so spot on. I didn't think I had the stomach for it but it happily managed. 

Service - major kudos to our two servers who handled our awkward seating situation so professionally. Side story - the table near us had two young kids who threw up/soiled themselves some time during their meal. Not sure how, what, and when but the servers were able to accommodate us with a new table further away without embarrassing either parties.

It is a tapas style restaurant, which I enjoy, as you get to eat the same amount, but eat a lot of different things. Being a celiac as well, they ensure everything we ordered was ok for me to eat.

Yes, for just ELEVEN DOLLARS, you can enjoy as many sushi rolls, Nigiri, or Tuna pieces as you can handle, along with fried rice, garlic noodles and spring rolls. And if that's not enough, you can add a Miso Soup and Ginger Salad for just $2 more. We enjoyed a delicious order of California, Yellowtail and Tempura Shrimp rolls, then mixed in a Spicy Salmon roll on round two. Service was prompt and friendly, and there are a fair number of local craft brews on tap, along with saki and wine.

They didn't have any beef or chicken whatsoever, so almost all of their meat-containing dishes weren't even available.

They made the trade-in process so easy too. Lug in your boxes or totes to the Trade counter--they give you a ""card"" (be sure to hang onto it) and tell you to come back in 20 minutes... (no appointments!) this gives you time to browse around...and I have ALWAYS found more stuff!

They have always taken my magazines...so I end up getting MORE magazines. I LOVE their magazine selections.

If they don't take your stuff on your current visit--don't give up...just bring it back again (maybe a different Buyer will take it) or take it to the other location on Northern.

I live super close nearby (like a 2 minute drive) but haven't came here before. Both my friend and I had not eaten dinner so decided to come here since it was nearby

This specific location has changed ownerships/names/etc quite the few times in the past but it seems like this restaurant has been doing well. Surprisingly easy life still exists next door Lol xD 

Décor hasn't changed since the last owner but they changed the layout a bit. I think they put a drink station or something in the dining room, side closest to the streets. 

Since the weather is getting warmer by the day, we both were kind of craving something not so hot. Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio. Vermicelli noodles with grilled pork and egg rolls. One of my favorite things to get in terms of viet food. Granted this location is a little away from the main ""Chinatown"" or Asian area so their prices are a little bit higher than others. For this specific dish, it was $10 each. Brief glance over the pho's they were a little more pricey too. 

Service wise, they were pretty fast. We were sat down at a table almost as soon as we arrived. Waters were brought out quickly and our orders were taken. 

Surprisingly it didn't take long for them to bring out the food too. The restaurant wasn't completely full but they weren't dead either. Maybe give or take 50% capacity? Granted it was dinner time but not bad. 

Their version of bun thit nuong cha gio is a fairly good size, in appearance. Topped with 2 cut egg rolls, a metal cup of their fish sauce, pile of bbq pork, some cooked chopped green onions, shredded pickled carrots, and carrots. All these on top of a bed of vermicelli noodles with a bed of mainly bean sprouts before that. Overall, taste wise was not bad. The thit nuong (bbq pork) was a little overcooked but nicely. The amount of bean sprouts on the bottom was a bit much. More used to more of a ""chopped greens"" with some bean sprouts vs almost entire bean sprouts. The best part is the cha gio (egg rolls). Though they aren't the best I've had, they are one of the very few that use taro in the filling. Flavor is light. My friend didn't even notice until after I mentioned it. Do love viet style egg rolls in general. With and without. But it was surprising they did theirs with. 

Overall, not bad. Maybe like to try their pho or their broken rice plates in the future. 

Side note - I used to purchase these ""big bao"" from a person who made them from home. I heard she now does them at this restaurant. Granted they are pricier now but they were yummy.",2017-05-05 17:22:59

The inside was barren, only one other table occupied. This was good because we had to push same tables together so all of us could sit together near the back.

I ordered the lunch fajitas and did a split of the steak and shrimp. My meal came with three flour tortillas, rice, beans, guacamole, sour cream, and lettuce/tomatoes. The skillet contained red and green bell peppers, onions, and steak/shrimp.  The portion size was good but the presentation and taste were lacking. The guacamole, beans, and rice lacked flavor. 

One co-worker ordered the soup (green chili corn chowder), another ordered Courtney's Burrito, and a third ordered enchiladas. I can't remember what the other two ordered. However, everyone's meal except for one arrived at the same time. When our co-workers meal finally arrived, the server apologized saying they burnt it the first time and had to remake it.

The day of the appt, I show up and Brennan has called sick. No one bothered telling me, though. They really need a new reservation system that will notify them when a specific masseur has been requested so this type of thing doesn't happen again. 

The manager kindly comped my visit (since my husband was with me) or I would have cancelled. I had again purchased a deep tissue massage, but it was little better than meh. I didn't get a deep tissue massage - even when I requested more pressure twice. The woman giving me a massage was sub and I'm guessing pretty inexperienced. I asked her a couple of basic questions about a troubled area, and she didn't even attempt an answer.

My husband said his massage wasn't as good as the first either.

I was told that Amos is spectacular wih deep tisue and reflexology, so I have rebooked with Brennan and Amos.

The waiter liked to fill them up almost to the top with our bottle of Chianti Classico - I guess he didn't want to come by and fill them up too often. The last time I was served wine like this was at an open bar at a cheap wedding. Poor Chianti. 

We ordered the seafood platter for two. it came with some tiny oysters that looked old and some pieces of bread with cream cheese on top to put the smoked salmon on. The shrimp were just OK. Definitely a miss.

I had the prime rib - I asked for it medium rare and in my eyes it was done medium but the waiter insisted it was medium rare. I asked for pepper on the table but the waiter said he doesn't have and to just let him know when - then he violently cracked a whole heap on the side of my plate... Weird.

My friend had the bone-in ribeye steak. It was good. The assistant came by and served the potato but he was really hurried and kind of violently dressed the potato. I guess the theme of the restaurant is 'violently dressing food'.  

To top off the dinner we ordered the cherries jubilee for two - THIS WAS THE WORST EVER. The cherries weren't even really caramelized and by the time the ice cream came to us it was a melting heap of mess. The dessert itself tasted pretty terrible.

If you're in the mood for a simple fruit smoothie and not a bunch of other junk added in, they will accommodate. My recent favorite is the Key Lime Cooler sans yogurt, extra banana, no agave or sugar added. Tart and refreshing. Great for a morning meal or post-workout. 

The prices vary and the sizes are absurd. You're not going to find a ridiculous 465oz smoothie here, which I like. Also, they have tons of snack foods to choose from -- pretzels, nuts, bars, mixes, etc.

Went to Hofbrauhaus late on a Friday night in the late fall/early winter. It was 10:30 and the line was out the door! It was freezing cold outside but my group and I decided to wait it out.

For just the overall hotel... it would be about 3.5 to 4 stars compared to other hotels in ""Vegas.""  Away from Vegas, this would be closer to 4.5 to 5.  When you go to Vegas you get so jaded about hotels but then you have to factor in dollar for dollar, what's your value?  I'm sorry, but this hotel, you can get for around $25-$45 a night if you plan right.  Now, compare that to other hotels for the same price.  Driving in, I literally saw the Travelodge, a total hellhole, for ""Starting at $39.""  Um, a dump for more than I was paying for a very nice hotel with a dose of everything.  

You have to know what you're getting... this hotel is a far better price than where it sits on the foodchain.  At the top, you have your;

Encore, Wynn, Bellagio, Venetian.

Then...

Palms, Mandalay, Monte Carlo, Luxor, MGM, etc...

Then...

NY, NY, Circus Circus, Harrah's, Golden Nugget, etc.

And this is right where the LVH would fall in line, right between that group and the following type;

Terribles, Palace Stations... 

Then...

Imperial Palace, etc.

Now... with that said, look at the prices for the top hotels... and look at a dump like the Imperial Palace.  For the price of a room at the Imperial Palace, which is still probably more expensive, you get a really solid Vegas experience.

However, there are some things on which to improve;

IMPROVEMENTS

#1 - ELEVATORS!!!!  It's ridiculous, the waits.  The reason why is that not all of them are working at one time and they are extremely slow.  Better yet, some elevators, like the one in the Central Tower (floors 1-15), at the far end on the right... it'll literally reset all of the floor numbers on every floor.  Numbers are pressed... then they vanish... you press them again... next floor, gone.  Then someone will get on and punch a lower floor, you go all the way back down and start again.  It's just absolutely the most ridiculously easy thing to fix and, clearly, this is not a priority.  There are literally crowds downstairs waiting, like 30-40 deep, at all hours of the day and night.

#2 - The trash by the elevators.  Over the course of the weekend, we noticed the same overflowing trash can for three mornings... where in the hell was housekeeping!?  (Management, it was on the 14th floor.)  And the crazy thing is that when the elevator would go down and open on some floors... different smells would loft in from the various other overflowing trash cans.  People on the elevator noticed it before me but you definitely could smell it.  

#3 - Controlling the people.  With a mid-level hotel, you get mid to low level people coming in.  There were kids at a basketball tournament, dribbling the balls in the lobby on the nice floor... nobody said a word to them but it just ruins the overall vibe... like, if they did that at the Bellagio, they'd be dragged outta there.  


I really see and like the potential in this hotel... how awesome would it be if they could tidy up those details and still offer these amazing rates?  But dollar for dollar, you're not gonna find this much to do or this nice of a hotel anywhere near these rates.  It's easily worth $100 week nights, $150 weekends... so when I got a room for $25 a night and $45 on the weekend nights, it's a steal.  Regardless, they need to get those elevators going because that's what everyone will remember... people were livid.

I'm giving it five stars because I always look at the 'wow' factor per dollar, and it's a no-brainer.  It's not perfect here but it's far more value per dollar than basically anywhere in town.",2012-07-24 04:55:15

After being here for that event, I would absolutely return here for other events. We didn't splurge for great seats - they weren't the cheapest but maybe the second or third cheapest we could get? But, we could still see completely fine. The crowd was energetic and the setup for UFC is fantastic. It's really fun to go here because you can play a little video poker and drink at the bar, then stroll down the corridors to the arena (many restaurants on the way) and if you still have any drink left, they give you a plastic cup to bring into the arena with you. It was fantastic (and I won playing video poker as well as my fight bets so I was happy). The staff was professional and nice, the production was top notch and there was never a line for the women's bathroom (being fight night and all). The concession lines were all pretty short, too.

While I have visited Montreal on many occasions, it was my first time using the metro system. I didn't have the opportunity to use any of the buses but I found the metro (aka the subway) making it easy to get to the places I wanted to go. It was also ideal that one of the major connections, Berri-UQAM, was located underneath the bus terminal. 

I found the stations and metro cars to be clean and safe. Plus it's cheap. It's $2.75 per an adult ride, the same price as Toronto, but if you bought a weekly pass, it's way cheaper than TTC's weekly pass. Also it's more flexible regarding a traveler's schedule.

All in all, the STM is one of the better metro systems we have in Canada. It made it simple for anyone who isn't familiar with Montreal to move around with ease.",2009-07-03 18:51:37

I opted trying a variety of meats, the marinated meats being my favorite. The marinated beef was my number 1 pick and kept going back to that. They were also missing the oil and spices that is normally served with KBBQ, it possibly could have been at the buffet line and just didn't see it?

Upon arrival, we had our coats taken for us so that was a nice touch. The restaurant is pretty dark and a bit loud (since the tables are rather close together) so it was a bit difficult to have a private conversation. 

We ordered the lobster/shrimp bisque and the sardines to start. Both dishes came quickly and were good - nothing spectacular but pretty yummy. 

45 minutes later we still hadn't received our mains. After more waiting and asking the waiters to check on the food, it turns out they had incorrectly delivered our food to another table. Instead of realizing they delivered our food to another table, they thought the order for the other table was recorded wrong. So when our food was delivered, it was wrong again. If we had never asked, we would've never gotten our food, since in their system, they had already delivered it. 

After this entire fiasco, I would've thought we'd get more than a barely-there apology, but nope, that's all we got. As if it wasn't a big deal.

I'm hooked.  We ordered 10 different items and just layed them on the table smorgasbord style.  Wow.   The Japanese Lasagna is great but I would recommend sharing it cuz it's very rich as was the Orange Bowl, no rice - excellent! .  I particularly like the Mistake roll, D.C.

Go to spend some time here. Enjoy it. Relax. Each table and booth is unique, cozy, and intimate. Find a spot that calls out to you and set up camp for the evening and let them look. SPOILER ALERT - The meal started with a rose pedal hand wash. This combined with some delicious fragrant Moroccan Tea, I sunk into the soft, authentic furniture,  and I never wanted to leave. I asked one of the owners if they allowed slumber parties, and she laughed. *Sigh* I guess she thought I was joking, and I guess I'll take that as a 'no'.

Do not mistake this place for one of those cheap all you can eat Korean buffets. This place has set menus based on number of people or a la carte if you want to make your own combination.
The must have appetizer is Uni and pork belly. It's low carb, fatty and creamy. All kinds of yummy goodness. Seriously. One order has two wraps so order accordingly. 
The meat is such good quality. Trimmed and perfectly marbled. You can choose marinated or natural. I recommend natural since the quality of meat was excellent it doesn't need much. This is how you know the place is good when you grill the meat simply and dip it in a bit of sesame oil, salt and pepper.

The prices here are exactly the same as Harkins.  Next time I'm seeing a movie, I may pass up the busy Tempe Marketplace scene (hard to park and bigger crowd) for the much more layed back Mesa Riverview scene.  It's just one exit over.

This location seems to be run by a family (husband/wife/daughter combo) and they are as sweet and smiley as can be.

The way Nandos works is you order at the counter and then they bring you your food and drink to eat at the tables when it's ready. It's not a classy joint (it is clean though) and it's perfect for an easy lunch or dinner. They do a lot of take out too.

There can be more filling to be honest, but it's still very good and it's a sizeable meal. Most people can't handle the raw jalapeño slices, so don't forget to pick those out if you're one of them. 

Iced drinks are good, especially the iced coffee but sometimes it's too much ice. Try the sugarcane juice if you never had it before. Very sweet and refreshing. 

You get your sandwich and go. There's no fancy service. All the banh mi are under $4. 
It's a big store and there's a lot of seating. The repeating automated voice calling out numbers might get annoying but I tune it out. 

It's so Asian here. The decor and the foods and the service and the products... But all sorts come in, it's great.

Note: don't leave the banh mi in your car and forget about it. It will stink up your car like no other. Probably due to the pickled vegs.",2015-02-07 21:36:51

I was excited to try this place and meet a friend for food and drinks here. Bottom line is ""I've had better."" - I've definitely had better Mexican food and better drinks, BUT this is a fun place downtown to hang out and grab some food, (I've yet to try Le Thai).  The outdoor seating and on a nice day with a couple of beverages, is definitely worth it. 

I got the Shrimp Salad with large shrimp, mandarin oranges, some walnuts, and a sweet dressing. I really liked this salad when paired with my Prickly Pear cocktail. 

My friend got the chicken enchiladas with red sauce. It wasn't spicy but lacked flavor and spices that I know that chicken enchiladas usually have. The sides were rice and beans. 

The service- I think they are still working out the kinks, our server brought us a copy of our receipt with no place to sign or tip..? We had to get this matter resolved with the hostesses up front.

If I was downtown hanging out and bar hopping, would I hop over to La Comida? Probably not. 

Would I come here for Mexican food? Most likely not. There are better places in the valley for Mexican food.

The other day, however, I had an overpowering craving for Mexican food and decided to take a chance on Manuel's. I was not disappointed and, in short, I think I may have found my new Mexican food hangout. 

You might be asking, off the bat, why 4 stars instead of 5? Well, that rests entirely with the staff working the front counter. My wife and I walked in and while we made eye contact with about three or four folks milling around the counter and the lobby area, not a single one of them would acknowledge us. I thought it was pretty weird and borderline rude, and were it not for my craving and being ravenously hungry, we'd both have walked out. Having experienced the food I'm glad I didn't, but I'm still deducting a star because that's not the proper way to greet your guests, especially new customers. We did eventually get seated after someone else noticed us standing there like idiots, but you only get one chance at the first impression and as a restaurant, they blew it, big time.

The food, thankfully, was good enough that it made up for the bad experience at the front counter. I had the (chicken) chimichanga dinner, and my wife tried their hamburger, as she's not really a fan of Mexican food. The chimichanga was excellent, full of properly cooked, wells seasoned and all white chicken meat. None of that nasty dark meat stuff I've sometimes gotten at other Mexican places. Everything was moist and fresh, with generous guacamole and sour cream on top and plenty of rice and beans. The plate was crazy hot when it first came out, but that's typical for Mexican places and I don't mind. 

My wife's burger was excellent. I realize it's a Mexican joint and you don't really expect top shelf burgers, but as far as pre-made patties go, this one was actually really good and properly cooked and far better than what we used to get at the old standby Mexican restaurant. 

As with almost all Mexican places, we got the requisite chips and two kinds of salsa, pretty much the second we sat down at the table. The chips tasted fresh and not too greasy (pet peeve of mine) and the salsas were excellent. Refills were timely, on both the chips and the drinks, so I have no complaints on the service whatsoever. Given that the place was super busy, I actually have to give them credit for not falling behind in the service. We were very well taken care of. 

From an architecture perspective, this place pretty much exudes the standard ""Mexican Restaurant"" vibe, with the pseudo-rustic look inside, lots of wood beams, tile floors and arches. They have a neat looking outside patio area as well as a 'Cantina' section that I'd like to try on my next visit, and pretty decent parking. I'm more concerned with the food quality than the overall appearance, but it's nice to see a place that still has the right 'vibe' for an authentic Mexican joint.

Fortunately Sam's took our kids in with open arms and gave us outstanding customer service.  The kids shared an order of chicken fingers & fries.  We had wings.

The chicken fingers were huge and the fries very tasty.  The wings were a decent size and also quite delicious.  The waitress was there whenever we needed her and very friendly.

It had been a couple of years since I had last been to Casbah and while I remembered it being decent, it differed a bit from my fiance's opinion that this was the best of the Big Burrito restaurants.  Due to that it had been on my list of restaurants to visit so that I could get a better opinion of it.  The restaurant looked the same that I remembered it with a large outdoor seating area and a smaller one inside with the bar on one side of the restaurant and the dining room on the other.  It was all nicely and tastefully decorated.

I arrived shortly after 5 PM and immediately made my way into the bar area of the restaurant as I hate taking up a table if I am eating by myself.  There was no one else at the bar at this point and the bartender quickly greeted me and gave me a happy hour menu while explaining it to me.  I had not been planning on getting a drink but one of the $6 cocktails caught my eye and I ended up ordering it.  The bartender was pretty friendly guy and explained how he came up with the drink while he made the drink and we chatted for a bit.  For my entrée I decided to order the Long Island Duck which was a roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, rosemary, black mission figs and duck jus.  Whenever I had ordered it I had actually missed the fact that it came with a braised leg and was excited to see that extra unexpected portion of meat on my plate whenever it was delivered to me.  The whole meal ended up being incredibly tasty with the duck breast being cooked perfectly with nice seasoning and not greasy at all.  This was in stark contrast to the leg which was incredibly juicy and greasy which I absolutely loved.  Normally I am not a fan of greasier duck but the two preparations really helped to enhance the other.  Finally the figs provided a nice touch of sweetness while the gnocchi was pillow like and tasty.  It was also nice to be able to taste a hint of rosemary on them which I had forgotten about between the time I had ordered and when it was delivered.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  Both my cocktail and my meal were really good and I would actually consider this to be one of the best meals that I have eaten in a little while.",2013-06-28 01:15:18

I got takeout and by the time I got home the redneck poutine was a bit cold and dry but I'm sure it's great fresh. I expected it to have more gravy from the pictures on the menu, but it just had a bit of BBQ sauce with the cheese and pulled pork.
Other reviews said this place was a hole in the wall, but I disagree -- the atmosphere inside was perfect. The other BBQ places I've been to were 10x more rundown.
The big reason why this place isn't getting 5 stars is a) the prices.. quite steep for the portions (e.g. $6 for upgrading the fries to a poutine) and b) I ordered takeout and picked 2 sides, and when I got home realized I didn't get either of my sides, which was really disappointing because my bill came to $26 for one person.. 
Anyway, next time I'll be happy to 'settle' for just the brisket because though the pulled pork was good, the brisket was the killer.
I will return, but I'll double check my order next time I get takeout.

I'm most familiar with Moxie's Highway 7 location, which I've found to be above average. In terms of all the ""upscale casual"" restaurants, I still like Joey more, but Moxie's is probably my second favourite as it's still light years ahead of most of the Milestones-type places and I like it a bit better than earls.

I would give this restaurant a solid 3 stars. The food will never be phenomenal here, but it was all pretty good. We had the kimchi, Korean BBQ  flat bread as an app. The meat and kimchi were very good, but the actual ""flat bread"" was just white pizza dough. I had the prosciutto pizza as a main, and I liked that a bit more. Nothing mind-blowing, and the portion size was on the small side, but I enjoyed it.

The restaurant itself is nice, with massive stone walls and high ceilings, but it pretty much looks just like a Joey or an earls. The location is pretty great though -- I'm so glad to see more restaurants open along University Avenue, which was a dead zone for so long. With other restaurants on the way, like the Cactus Club Cafe that is going to open at First Canadian Place, the financial district is becoming a mecca for huge lounge-ey chain restaurants. Being on the lower part of University also means that it's deceptively close to the Rogers Centre, and it's always good to find another place to dine and drink before or after watching the Jays or another event.

One complaint is that the only beer they have on tap is their house beer, which isn't bad, but I prefer it when there's a greater selection on tap.

Where this restaurant really shines is the service. Our server was fabulous and talked to us for quite a while.

Because it was the first night, every single staff person asked us if we needed anything, which got to be a bit much, but I do give Moxie's credit for really caring about service. That's one thing that's always stood out when visiting this chain.",2013-09-15 03:20:53

He was right, since it was pretty much the only salad I'd choose, mostly bec. many of the other choices contained allergens.  Meatballs were calling my name as well, so I chose to order the salad ($6.50), plus chicken ($2), and a side of one meatball ($1).  Paid and took my tag number to a booth.  

Salad, w/c glistened beautifully dressed w/ a balsamic vinaigrette, came topped w/ what looked like a teaspoon of lightly toasted pancetta and a tablespoon of crumbled goat cheese.  Chicken was missing, but was quickly brought to the table- about a quarter-cup, shredded, served cold in a dipping bowl.  In another dipping bowl sat my one lone meatball and a little dollop of red sauce.  I savored this little morsel w/ the dinner roll that came w/ the salad.

I rarely treat myself to a nail salon because I have had some bad luck in town and I just did mine at home rather poorly for free.  My mom always treats me to a mani and pedi when I visit Texas, which is very sporadic (2-3 times a year at most).  My friend Nicole B. highly recommended this place and suggested I give it a try.

The salon is not far from where I live (less than 5 minutes away by car).  I snagged the first appointment on Sunday (they open at 11 AM) for a regular manicure and a pedicure TBD based on a book of options.  My technician Lynn is excellent.  She is very friendly and made sure I had a great, relaxed experience.  I was offered green tea which is a great perk.

Lynn completed my manicure first and then took me to the spa pedicure area.  I soaked my feet and ended up selecting the ""Royal Spa Pedicure"" which included a scrub, mask, paraffin wax and hot stone massage.  My feet are excruciatingly dry in the desert and I wanted to choose a pedi that included parrafin (though that could be added to the other ones).

Since I was referred by a client, I would have gotten 10% off my first visit but my yelp check-in gave me 20% off!  My friend Nicole B. will get a discount for referring me too!  The pedicure was very relaxing and I never felt rushed.  Lynn talked to me most of the time (of course my fave topic is Japanese food!  She asked me for a list of restaurants before I left).

The salon is so clean, spacious, and has a beautiful interior.  I do not do gel nails, but Lynn told me there are 2,000 colors to choose from!  I stuck with regular OPI polish, my favorite brand.  The experience was exactly what I have been looking for in a local salon, and the yelp deal made it that much sweeter.

Yes, it has the best of things, and yes, it has the worst of things. I suppose one's rating reflects what aspect/s of this famous terrain one focuses on. I focus not on the homeless guy sleeping against a wall but instead I marvel at the neon bombardment of colors. I focus not on the thousands of flyers underfoot of naked women, advertising escort services, but instead I am enchanted by the dancing fountains, the music, St. Mark's Square and the Eiffel Tower and the New York skyline in close proximity to each other. 

Let's face it: this is one of the most iconic geographical places in the US - probably the world, actually. It is immediately recognizable by young and old alike. Of course it has the most of the most of everything. That is part of its charm.

If you decide to walk the Strip, be prepared for a hike. It's deceptively long when you take into consideration all the criss-crossing, traversing, up and down stair walking and escalator riding you will do. On my recent trip here, a good quarter of the escalators were not working and a lot of construction was going on. If one were disabled, one would have a hard time indeed navigating some of these overpasses. 

There are some fun and funky shops, malls and stores along the way to explore and God knows, lots of restaurants. We enjoyed going into all the major casinos/hotels to get a feel of the various themes, the architecture and artwork. I consider much of the Strip to be like a Disneyland for adults. Half of it looks like a movie set, with pirate ships and Roman colliseums within a block or so. Outlandish - but again, this is part of the charm that is Vegas. We loved going into Caesar's and riding the circular escalators and checking out the uber-high-end boutiques, and visiting the centrally-located Sephora. My folks went to the mall housing Macy's but I opted out, having all these stores in Seattle. There's the ""Fashion Center"" and the M&M shop. One can spend the day - or more! - just walking and checking out all the stores and hotels and street musicians, and get one's fill of entertainment without spending a dime.

I was there at Christmas-time, and I must say, the decorations in the hotels and along the square by the Venetian were simply gorgeous. In fact, they had outdoor festivals at night by the Venetian tree (which was glorious), and they were mesmerizing. Who needs to gamble to have fun? 

One point of note: unbeknownst to us, you cannot flag down a cab to drive you to your destination, so if you get tired walking, you'll have to somehow crawl to a taxi stand outside a hotel to legally catch a cab. There's a city law that forbids cabbies from picking up passengers who aren't at a legit cabbie stand. Who knew???",2014-01-08 23:32:54

At first glance, it's a charming little ""neighborhood"" Italian restaurant.  Nothing fancy.  Simple decor, even a bit cheesy but in a lovable way.  It's comfy.  It's friendly.  You feel quite welcome when you arrive.  It's like dining with friends or extended family members.  

Once inside, though, we were deflated by the decor.  There are NO windows, and an odd configuration to the two claustrophobic rooms.  The chairs aren't terribly comfortable and there are NO tablecloths.   

But I didn't let any of that bother me because I had heard the food was terrific.

We ordered two appetizers to share: cured beef and scallops. Both were delicious.  We ordered the cannelloni and veal piccata.   The cannelloni was good, but nothing special.  The veal dish was average.  

The biggest disappointment -- and a clue that attention to detail is NOT a specialty -- was the rotten lettuce in the salad.  Not one or two pieces of lettuce, but a good half-dozen in each salad were beyond wilted -- soft and brown.  

We had gelato for dessert.  It was disappointing.  

The service was reasonably attentive but ineffective.  We had to ask for water CONSTANTLY!!!!   And, after the first round of drinks before dinner, we were never asked if we'd have liked more.  

Okay, but hey, it's a neighborhood restaurant, right?  Casual, family dining, right?   WAIT!  $110 for dinner for two at a ""neighborhood"" place?  For THAT kind of tab, I would have liked tablecloths, better service and a more even quality to the food.

1) Oysters - we ordered the ones from PEI which were delish.  The cocktail sauce that came with it was good! 

2) Lobster poutine - This was a disappointment.  I'm fairly certain that it said on their menu that they used their lobster bisque in the poutine which I thought would be their ""gravy"" however, the sauce looked like any ole gravy and didn't taste like a lobster bisque.  I think the reason why this was a disappointment is that lobster has such a subtle sweet flavour and can be very easily overpowered.  When I ate the poutine, all I really tasted was the gravy and the cheese, not so much the lobster.  The lobster certainly was not the star of the show.  

3) Lobster roll - This was good.  Having spent a few years living in the East Coast, this was a good lobster roll.  I also liked how they had homemade chips instead of fries on the side and it also came with a big pickle! 

4) Lobster mac n cheese - Another disappointment.  Same issue as the poutine, the lobster was totally overpowered by the cheese and in fact, my husband felt it was very salty and I felt it was flavourless.  We ended up having to ask for pepper to give it some flavour and even that wasn't enough.  Perhaps I should have asked for some ketchup...but doesn't that just take away from the fact that I'm supposed to be eating something so decadent? Also, there wasn't a lot of lobster meat compared to the amount of pasta and cheese in the dish.  

Service was good - the staff was very attentive.  

Overall, I probably wouldn't come back.  The prices aren't bad but for a place called ""Rock Lobster,"" you'd expect that the lobster would be the star of the show, unfortunately it was clearly a runner up to everything else.",2014-07-02 00:21:11

Being my first visit to a Dim Sum restaurant, I was a little bit confused about how it worked...and I still am!  The place was very busy and I was seated promptly.  I was given a menu to look at and then these carts started coming around with different types of dishes on them.  Many of the staff manning the carts didn't speak great English, so I wasn't sure what some of the items were.  I tried several different dishes, each had good flavor and I enjoyed them.

I was debating on the carne asada fries and the carne asada tacos, but decided on the tacos because it was colllddd outside and I didn't want to wait for fries to be made.  The tacos were made really quickly!  THat was nice, because people who ordered burgers and fries had to wait longer.  I thought the price point of $8 for 3 small tacos was a bit high, $7 would have been more appropriate.  Especially in comparison to the burger and fries for $9, which was a LOT more food.

As for the tacos, I enjoyed the seasoning, the fresh cilantro, and the sauce.  The meat quality was not great.  Instead of strips of meat, like I expected with carne asada, it was more like... bits of meat? I would have preferred more strip-like cuts of meat, which is what I think of when I think carne asada.  Maybe they should just rename them beef tacos and then it won't be as confusing!  I was still kinda hungry after I finished my tacos.",2017-01-19 22:10:00

Your table has a card for them to know if you want more (fire it up) or no more (cool it down). That will gauge your serving time. They come around faster than you think!

Today I opted for their Build-Your-Own Bowl instead of a pita wrap. 

Hummus Options:

- Baba Ghanoush - I love the earthy taste of eggplant and sadly it was not allowed to shine through. Instead it is covered up by too much acidity from the lemon. But to each their own. 

- Spicy Hummus - nice spice level, but for me, it definitely needed more salt. A little bit more acidity would have rounded it off for me.

- Hummus (Regular) - avoided since I was not really too impressed with the other two.

My final choice for the bowl was the Market, consisting of pureed artichoke hearts and spinach. Once again, could definitely use more seasoning, but it fit my needs at the time, beanless and not soy based. 

Greens Choices:

- Baby Chard, Baby Arugula, Spinach and something else. Went for the chard

Skipped the black lentil or white rice topping.

Meat Choices:

- Available choices are grilled chicken, marinated beef, and braised lamb. Definitely chose the lamb. Hands down didn't need to try the other two.
- For vegetarians, they also have roasted vegetables available, which I added as well for my lunch.

Toppings:
Just going off the top of my head,  they have available quinoa tabbouleh, pickled red onions, cilantro, curly parsley, lemon wedges, diced cucumbers,  diced tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, chopped kalamta olived and sliced pickle rounds. There were others, but didn't care for them at the time.

Sauces:
- Harissa: not a fan mainly for the fact that I'm used to spicier harissa than what they make here. Very tame for sure.
2 other choices that did not pique my interest at first.

Dressings:
Tahini Dressing because it was dairy free.
2 other sauces were not appealing at the time.

Side:
- Falafel: so far the best in town. The texture is great. Definitely not dense. The nixture of the pureed chick pease and the big chunks  sets it apart. Downside, the tahini dipping sauce is too watered down. I've been spoiled by using greek yogurt in my tahini dipping sauces in the past haha.

The final rating would have been a 4 but taking with the owner Najib(sp?) was the reason for changing it. He took criticism well to the things I personally didn't like and was very  humble with the praises with what I did enjoy. #supportlocal",2017-11-13 22:55:17

I was never interested in their meals just kinda stuck to a particular dish. After my dance on Tuesday my two girl friends suggested we go grab some food and late night snack. We started to wonder the streets and came across this place. Decided to go in at 1030pm at night. We were greeted by a friendly server who informed us which part of the restaurant was open to taking orders. We sat and began looking at the new and revised menus. 

Like I said earlier, I haven't been here in ages. I could not believe how much the menu changed! I had a very difficult time trying to decided on what to order. I decided on the chicken, shrimp with vegetables over quinoa. It was cooked to perfection. Extremely light on the body which was an excellent thing consider the time at night we were eating this meal. I complemented the meal with a nice glass of house red wine. 

What I found disturbing was the way our waitress was dressed. She was wearing a low neck/cut black short dress. It looked like her Breast were going to pop right out. I understand some female serves feel they need to do that to gain some extra tips but attending this bar with a group of ladies, non of us really needed to see it. I'm pretty sure if she moved a certain way there was no holding them in.

He wouldn't even change the thermostat to confirm it was a faulty thermostat. So he leaves and I call NV energy they send a employee out hours later tonight and the NV energy employee replaces the thermostat with the new one and goes it's not the thermostat it's your furnace. This isn't the first time I have seen home warranty contractors send out a company to fix something and they blame it on us.

I could feel my shoes melting on the pavement... Anyway, we're locals with one mutual day off, so we do what we can to make the most of it, living downtown and such. Yadda yadda yadda. Many people have talked about the Perch so we strategized our route to where we could pop in & cool off before checking out the shops in Container Park.

Upon arrival, we were the only patrons in the restaurant. After being seated and served ice water immediately, we were given a moment to chill out and browse the menu. I was a little disappointed with the options. For some reason, I was expecting there to be a bit more variety. Honestly, the brunch menu was a lot more appealing - but it's only available on Saturday & Sunday mornings. Booooo...

I ended up ordering the fried chicken sandwich and the boy got Thai chili chicken tenders with fries. Both were very tasty! You could taste just about every ingredient in the sandwich, which was great. I was nervous because, in my opinion, fried chicken tends to take over & dominate the flavor in other dishes I've had - this was not the case for the Perch. Well done! However, one weird critique I have is with the size of the plate that the sandwich was served on... The sandwich is fairly large and with it being served atop a heap of fries, I had a hard time not making a mess because the plate was so small. Other than that, the Perch gets an A in the food/flavor aspect.

NOTE: This place does not serve Ranch, only chipotle buttermilk dressing. Had to knock off a star for that one, because boy, those chicken tenders & fries would've been out of this world with some plain ol' Ranch to dip 'em in...",2016-08-01 01:43:44

We settled on Fukuburger inside F.A.M.E. We were warmly welcomed and any questions we had about the menu were answered eagerly. Sandwiches are all $7.99 with 6 main selections and a few specials. We chose the Chicken Katsu sandwich with habanero kabayaki, instead of crack sauce. The spicy sauce is usually served on the Karai burger. The chicken is pounded thin and coated with panko and fried crisp. It sits atop a soft bun and it's topped with shredded cabbage and katsu sauce. We also ordered garlic fries which come with crack sauce. They give you a silly nick name for when your order's ready. Our order was up when ""Frank the Tank"" was called. Frank's mom was ""Lady Luck"" she ordered the Fuku Burger which is your traditional cheeseburger with wasabi mayo and fuku sauce. 

Our order was quickly prepared, it was fresh and tasty. We really enjoyed the Chicken Katsu with the extra kick. I've previously given flack to Fukuburger (truck) for not unleashing the heat on their spicy burger. I'm happy to see they've amped up the spice over time. The sandwich had great flavor. I was less impressed with the bite of the Fukuburger, because it was loaded with mayo. I'm not fond of mayo, hence the substitution of the habanero kabayaki. So it was just a matter of personal taste, Frank and his mom enjoyed it. They also liked the crack sauce. I didn't find it as addicting (again, the mayo) but I did like the garlic fries, even if they were light in garlic flavor. 

Overall, Fukuburger serves up a moderately priced quick bite that is served fresh. Which can be a tough find center strip. They've come a long way since late nights in Chinatown parking lots.",2015-01-23 18:18:24

This was a one-stop-handle-it-all venue, which we loved, minus all the BS fees (cake cutting fee, room rental fee, etc.). The officiant was booked, the food order was taken (we chose a buffet and there were many selections to choose from), the cake was ordered, the floral arrangements were included, there was an onsite photographer for the chapel, the DJ for the reception was booked, we dropped off our theme decor and they did the rest; the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable, and assisted in any way possible. Everything is included, except the minister fee and the gratuities. Our package for about 70 guests was less than $5000.00 We made payments every month until it was paid off. 

We looked at several places including The Ritz (charges all those BS wedding fees), the sister property, El Caribe, which is now closed (not a good location; it didn't help that the coordinator giving us the tour of the facility told us some horror stories (not smart) and the outdoor walkway was right next to a hospice), and the Rainforest Cafe (the bathroom was gross). We were able to taste some of the food that was served at an acutal wedding that was taking place. The food was the most important factor besides the total package price. Everything that we had was very good.

We chose the indoor chapel, Victoria's Chapel, and the Embassy Terrace- beautiful facility (lower level). Everything went well. I got ready in the dressing room. The minister was very good- even funny at times. The reception was fun but was a blur (of course, that's probably what every bride & groom says, right?) The DJ was great- very lively. The staff was very good. My only complaint is that I think that the food was taken away kind of fast. Well, my mother-in-law mentioned the same thing. Or maybe I just didn't eat enough. We hired our own photographer, which was fine by them. All in all, everything went well. I think that everyone enjoyed our celebration. I would highly recommend this place.",2010-07-31 02:26:11

Overall, the Cuban sandwich was absolutely phenomenal! However, the plantain nachos tasted as though they accidentally dropped their entire spice rack into the jerked pork.

Cuban sandwich: a sumptuous mix of different kinds of well-seasoned meats melded together with creamy cheese and savory aioli. Although the sandwich was a bit heavy, it was incredibly delicious, and I look forward to tasting other sandwiches they have to offer.

Jerked pork and plantain chips: the plantain chips by themselves were crispy, well-salted and delicious. However, as I mentioned above, my taste buds felt that they were on a roller coaster ride of different spices, some of which may have gone well, but others that made me wonder ""I think something happened in the kitchen, and it involves someone experimenting with every spice he has in his spice rack"".

Ok, how does putting a 1/2 lb of meat on a low quality sliced bread from a bag count as a sandwich to be proud of? What happened to lettuce, cheese, a tomato? Why do you put Jason's Deli stickers on your Lay's Potato chip bag? No matter what sticker you put, it was still Lays that did all the work.  The cookies are decent.  Veggie wraps are pretty good but would be much more awesome with some feta or goat cheese or even better if you take some of the massive amount of meat from the mediocre sandwich and put that it there.

I guess that's *okay*, but some of the personality and charm is somehow diluted as they grow larger? I dunno, maybe I'm trippin...?

This particular location is still advertised (modestly) in their semi-stained window that they're ""NEW"", which is accurate, however, it seems sorta ""crumby"" and not enough ""maintenance sweeps in the dining area"" are done during the days' traffic.

Today, I tried the Cheese Enchiladas and am still gnawing at it 3 hrs later. But. Word the the wise: be careful as you're skipping away from the establishment as to avoid tipping your ""To Go"" bad-for-the-environment styro food thing-y, at all. Why? Because if you have any sort of sauce, beans, etc., you're in a heap of trouble, sugar. I speak of first-hand experience (today), and pretty much stomped back into Fili's with my bottom lip out and thrust the spilled bag before me. The nice lady calmed me down (plus it was hot and I was wearing black and already crabby) and cleaned up my mess of a lunch, served more frijoles that had escaped earlier, and wiped my tears away (kidding).

We were greeted and seated when we came in. I handed the man the certificate and he looked at it and said okay. We got our water and looked over the menus.

We ordered chicken panang curry, bbq spare ribs, beef pad see ew, and beef pad Thai. Each dish was a medium in spicyness. 

When we ordered, my boyfriend asked the waitress if it all comes with rice and she said that the ribs and curry did, so he asked her if it was enough for all of us or if we should order more rice. She said that we don't need more rice because we have the pad thai and the pad see ew and that's what you eat with the dishes. EXCUSE ME!? Who are you to tell us what we eat with our dishes? We're Filipino, we eat EVERYTHING with rice, even noodles! So of course we were a little embarrassed to even order anymore rice. 

The food came after about 10 minutes. My favorite dish was the panang, sooo good! The ribs were really good also, so soft and soo flavorful. The pad see ew and pad thai were average.

The reason why I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4 is because of their service. No one EVER smiled, asked us how we were doing, or initiated any type of conversation. I saw some other customers come in after us and the servers started talking to them, smiling, and even laughing, so they're obviously capable of doing so, they just didn't with us.

During the week they offer an all-you-can-eat lunch menu that includes some of their popular sushi rolls and other menu items for $14. (I enjoyed it even more when it was only $12).

The atmosphere is very quaint and charming. It's both trendy and welcoming. The staff is also very friendly. 

Regarding the sushi, the rolls are quite good. It's not the best sushi in the area, but it's very enjoyable. It's hard to describe; the rolls are fresh, but they aren't very refined. With that said, I always enjoy my meal. I've even brought out-of-town guests here. 

Regarding the appetizers, I love their edamame which is served hot (like I like it). I also really enjoy their vegetable spring rolls. The calamari, however, wasn't very good. It was a little chewy.  My favorite side is the garlic noodles. Delicious!!!

Ordered the valentine roll because I wanted some crisp and lots of fish! It's the dynamite roll with spicy tuna  covered with tuna and salmon sashimi. It was large and full of fresh flavor. The price was fair for the quality. The best part was that the shrimp tempura in the dynamite roll remained crispy throughout the whole roll. The fish to rice ratio was awesome!

Had a spicy gyoza off my J.W's plate and it was the right amount of sweet and spicy. Can't rmm the roll he got but it was okay.

We ordered: 
1) The Duck Poutine Pizza -  It's been recommended by quite a number of people and who doesn't love pizza, duck or poutine on their own...so putting them together must be good right? Truthfully, I didn't love it.  It was a very large dish, so you definitely need to share.  The dish is kind of awkward....you're not sure to eat it with your hands or eat it with a fork and knife...or what? Should I eat it as a pizza or eat it as a poutine....it felt like a confused dish.  In the end, I didn't love it.  The flavours were ok...but everything put together was not an appealing combination. 

2) Chicken Pot Pie - This dish is the epitome of good comfort food. The pie is so creamy and rich and the pie crust is flaky and delicious.  I actually only rated this restaurant a 4/5 because of this one dish.  I would come back to eat this again and again. The dish is quite heavy and filling especially since it comes with mashed potatoes (which I would say are pretty good if you like your mash smooth and creamy).  So in order to not feel like you're going to fall asleep after eating here, I would suggest switching it up for some greens instead.

They made the reservation in advance for us to play in two rooms and eat after. The kids took over the room and had a great time. I just watched but I think it's a cool concept and I would bring my younger cousins here for an hour of fun. 

The reason why I rated this place 2 stars is because of the food and service. I don't know if it is because of the party size or this is how things are usually but I wouldn't come back here for food or possibly anything. Considering this party was booked in advance i found it weird that they asked if we would be eating and didnt have the table prepared for 20 ppl. We also didnt have enough table space or seats and moved tables and got extra chairs ourselves. At 7:55 we were seated and it took forever for our waitress to take our order as she was assigned to too many people. It was unrealistic for her to handle such large parties by herself. I didn't receive my entree till 9:20 when almost everyone was done eating. There were about 2 ppl who received their food after me.  Even though I was one of  the first to order and the waitress said she punched my food in first. I did order an appetizer as well that came earlier but it still came after the majority of the party was served. We asked for water at the start of our meal and received it at the very end. It was just a baffling experience. 


The food was mediocre. Some people complained of their meals being bland especially the steak. I found the calamari okay nothing memorable. I felt the same about the cajun Alfredo. The best part of my meal was my long Island ice tea. Probably one of the best I've ever had. They said that the late food would be comped but it wasn't. the birthday girl ordered a medium rare steak and they gave her a dry medium well steak. She asked for medium rare and they brought out another dry steak. She didn't eat it and they said ""your first steak that you sent back was comped but the second steak was discounted"". It was ridiculous that the birthday girl had to explain what was wrong from start to finish for them to offer to comp her meal and room (After they already said they would) I told him my meal came almost last and nothing was done.

In my honest opinion I'd rec coming here to play and eat somewhere else. However there are better overall experiences in the burbs. Funny enough, I've seen this place online and I've been asking/telling ppl about it. I was planning to check this place out for a big family outing but this experience  definitely changed my mind.

I am giving 3 stars because the burgers as well as the cocktails were really good! I had the ahi tuna burger and it was truly fantastic, right amount of flavors!

However, I am still confused about the concept of HopDoddy. You get in and you're not sure what you're supposed to do.. Sit somewhere, wait, go at the bar.. I didn't see any signs that tells you where to go. After a few seconds, we were greeted by the bartender that told us that we were supposed to order at the counter ? 
So I guess you stand in line, choose your burger, order at the counter and then they assign you a table with a server? That's a weird concept.. You have to get your water at the soda machine. 

Why do we even have a server then? I'm quite confused. We did all the work already.. So it's between a fast-food and a restaurant.

Plus, there were so many servers walking around. I am not sure why they need that many servers.. It seemed useless.

After finishing the focaccia we had the fried calamari. It was good! It came with a spicy tomato sauce. I wish it had come with more sauce because it wasn't enough. 

We felt very full after the calamari so we shared one pizza. We got the crudaiola. Toppings included tomato sauce, arugula, prosciutto, cherry tomatoes and mozzarella. The crust was thin and a bit soggy in the middle but still delicious. Portions are huge! I only ate a quarter of the pizza!

After spending time in Italy in October I had developed a soft spot for diovala pizzas which is a spicy salami pizza.  This was my baseline for who had the best pizza while I was in Italy.

The place looks pretty slick, it's brand new, very clean and the space looks large. 

I ordered the diovala and my friend ordered san danielle.  It didn't take to long for the pizza to arrive and it looked almost like the pizzas I was eating 2 months ago!  The only major difference I saw was the spicy salami was more of a pepperoni here instead of the salami slices I got on all my orders in Italy but it might be a store by store thing and I just happened to get shaved salami that looked more along the lines of slices of prosciutto. It looked delicious and I couldn't wait to cut in. Yes eat with a knife and fork!

My first bite brought me back to Italy for sure.  Thin crust pizza, with a nice sauce and fresh cheese.  It was very good.  As I ate slice after slice of this thing I knew I would like it.  The major test was how the salami was going to be.  The first bite of the salami was ok.  I prefer the shaved slices more as this salami was slightly more chewy than what I had eaten before and that texture of the shaved spicy salami is a lot nicer however that does not stop the fact that this is a really good pizza!

I'm surprised I hadn't written a review yet, which would have undoubtedly been a 5 star review. However, had this past Sunday been my first experience with them I may have not been so hot to go back or recommend it to anyone. 

Its seems like they lost their sparkle. You used to be greeted by a friendly well dressed host/ess, this time we were greeted by a lady dressed in head to toe pink what looked like tennis or work out gear, complete with a sun visor on. When I go to a place that is asking me to spend $9-18 on lunch, in a setting such as Ticoz (which I love how cozy and dim it is in there) I expect the staff to look like they at least put an effort in. 

Our waitress could have given two sh*ts that we were there. We ordered chips and salsa (which used to be free there, but now you have to pay for them, whatev, its $2) It took longer then it should for them to come out. We placed our lunch order and waited and waited. We were there with a couple, my girlfriend and I split an order of fries and the lettuce wraps (both were good) those came out after a good 30 minutes, and it was seriously not busy in there at all. Our husbands food did not come with ours and they were told it would be ""any minute"" another 10 minutes goes by and the waitress comes flying over with their food, doesn't apologies and takes off as my friend is trying to request another drink. 

I've been hearing things here and there on Yelp that Ticoz is going down hill and didn't want to believe it, but after our experience this past weekend I am a little sad to see what has become of one of my once very favorite places to dine at.

As you walk in, there is half rectangle all wood bar with brass fixtures.  Some low top tables, and high tops toward the perimeter.  Large windows that face Neil St, and give the place an open feel.  Really a small place, but one with a lot of charm.

The service my friend and I received for lunch was excellent.  Seated right away, and at peak lunch time hour.  She checked on us often, and even had a few recommendations.  I have heard that once 5pm Happy Hour roles around the place is packed, and the service suffers.  Though we had an excellent experience.

The food is amazing.  We started off with some steamed Mussels.  The Prince Edward Island Mussels are to die for.  Which is a feet in itself during the winter in Champaign.  For the main lunch coarse,we both went with the Irish RLT. (Rashers, Lettuce, and Tomato)  The Irish rashers are awesome.  Smoky, meaty, and tender.  Charred romaine, and grilled tomato, hell ya.  The sweet potato chips are the real deal as well.  My Mom loves the mac & cheese, and the chowder is out of this world as well.  Other stuff on the menu I need to try is the Rueben, Fishermen's Stew, Shepard Pie, and just about anything else.

They have a good beer list as well.  About 15 taps.  Some are the traditional Guinness, Harp, etc.  Though a good mix of Midwest breweries.  Two Brothers, New Holland Brewing, and Smuttynose on tap when I visited.  I know they get some Founder's as well.

Now for my thoughts and opinions.

What is there not to like? Natural beauty, lots of hiking trails ranging from mild to extreme, and seeing wild animals in their natural habitat if you are lucky.

Here's a typical trip for me and I recommend this to all the newbies to do this as well. Always make the visitor's center your first stop. Why? Because not only is there a gift and souvenir store there, there are various miscellaneous items on display that provide you random information in regards to the venture you are about to partake. Sometimes they have announcements in regards to new and upcoming events that are relevant to your visit.

Step outside to the back of the center and you will encounter hands on exhibits on yes, you guessed it, anything desert and Red Rock related. 

The Visitor's Center closes before the park does, so it doesn't make sense for you to do it after the 13 mile scenic roundtrip for you are basically backtracking because its only one way.

After the Visitor's Center, you have your pick of whatever trails and scenic stops along your 13 mile drive. It's up to you how long you wanna stay.

Some random useful info: Always have bottled water with you at all times. Wear the appropriate clothing in conjunction to the weather. For those that just cant take a couple steps without having to use their phone because of the big game or social networking, there are two spots that I know of that gives 2 to 3 bars of intermittent reception which is better than none at all. The first one is at Calico 1, which ironically is the very first trail you run into. The second one is High Point Overlook, which is the halfway point. Your reception is going to be pretty stable as long as you are in the parking lot portion of it.

So there you have it. Vegas is not always all about casinos, buffets, shows, and 24 hour everything. Even the person with the huge ego will feel humbled at the sight of nature's awesome creation.

Food Quality & Price: The Eggs Benedict for brunch was fairly priced and very delicious. I was very happy with my choice.

Service: Slow and not very attentive. It took a fair amount of time to receive our orders, and the server rarely checked in.

This particular W is located in a great shopping and dining area in Scottsdale. Just walk out the front door and there are a host of restaurants and cool clubs to walk to.

When you call for airport transfer service you'll find out that they have a reasonably priced hotel limo service that can pick you up at baggage claim at Sky Harbor and deliver you promptly to the W. It's about $60 but worth it as you don't have to wait for an Uber at the airport and you can get right into a cool air conditioned SUV, of late it's been either a Yukon or a Cadillac Escalade.

The beauty of being a loyalty member with SPG is that there are two separate check in lines, one for regular check in and one for SPG. The SPG line provides you quick service and a nice fresh juice, bottled water or champagne when you check in. In this case, juice and water was provided. Check in is relatively quick and painless unless of course you're checking in before the start of a weekend. If you are coming in on a Friday, it's best to check in before 3:00PM as I have seen room check in delays and the tendency for the regular check in line to be full of impatient hipsters.

As far as the room is concerned, you have two choices and you better pay attention if you're a business traveller and need sleep. First, if you want sleep and need to rest before a big meeting, ask for a room away from the pool area because if your room faces the pool you can kiss any sleep goodbye as the pool club activity goes on all night and you will not get any sleep bc the club goers tend to linger and the techno music never gets quieter as it just seems to get louder. So ask for a room with the city or mountain view. While the view isn't much, you'll get sleep. I have had suites in both areas and while it's fun to see the pool lit up at night and hear all the hipsters partying, it does get old after the first night.

The room I get is the Fabulous/King and I love it bc it's got a great bed, not a Westin heavenly bed, but it's a good enough. As far as bathroom space, it's got a good sized shower and toilet area and one of the best toiletrie sets around. Everything is from the Bliss spa and they give you enough soaps and lotions for you to drown yourself in that fresh clean lemony smell.

This is why the W is my favorite hotel: 1) Best room service food ever. Try any of the salads, nachos and burgers - to die for and always prepared nicely and big portions 2) Best most creative mini bar I've seen, you want to take it all home 3) Bliss Spa is on premises for hair care and massage services 4) Sushi Roku is an awesome restaurant which converts to a breakfast and lunch place 5) Pool is great for people watching 6) Gym is small but it does the job with new equipment.

While I use this hotel as a business hotel 3-5 days at a time, I sometimes wish I had enough time to stay here for a vacation, as it has everything one needs to enjoy themselves thoroughly.",2017-09-04 20:14:51

No I do not mean phony posters of Elvis on the wall or poodle skirts on the waitresses. I mean honest home cooking for an honest price; for those too young to remember the 50's there were no Elvis posters or waitstaff in poodle skirts in the restaurants at that time.
The first thing that hit my eye upon entering was a genuine ugly green Hamilton Beach malted machine on the counter. Yes I did have a milk shake with my lunch - they had no malt otherwise I would have had a malted.
The pecan chicken is excellent and a turkey BLT was very good, as was the potato wedges that came with them. 
I see some folks had a bad experience with service. Either the staff has been retrained or those experiences were anomalies as we experienced friendly and very attentive service.

First, the restaurant on Sunday opens at 12 and we had reservations for 13 people right at 12. We went in 11:55 and were told the restaurant was closed which meant we couldn't just sit for 5 minutes and had to go back out in the cold. So, just be warned, don't come right before the restaurant opens. When we came in at 12:01, our tables weren't even set up so there was a bit of a mix up and other people sat in our area. Of course they are not going to take this 5 minutes to set up for us.

Second. The way Shiso Tree works is that there is a menu, but there are always specials posted on blackboards. Because we were a group of more than 12, we could only order our mains from this piece of paper (menu just for larger groups) which had like 5-6 pasta dishes. You could order from the special's board and you could also order appetizers and salads from the main menu...just not the main section. I was also the only person from my table that ordered from the main menu and they wouldn't make an exception which well, totally within their right, but ugh...I get it if we all ordered and it would take the kitchen some time, but one dish for one person? Also, we have been there before with larger groups and never had this restriction on us. 

Third. There are only 3 staff members for a packed restaurant so service is prompt meaning you get your orders taken, food brought and maybe cleared (you have to remind them) and they plunk a big pitcher of water for self-pour.

I am sad to say I didn't have the best experience...I remember when this place first opened, we had these two great waitresses (older ladies) and even the manager (?) who would pour generous glasses of wine and treat us like family. But now, it's become a typical Chinese-Congee-Queen-in-and-out experience. Needless to say, reservations are required.

Food is still good: pasta cooked al-dente with that perfect bounce-bite and the Japanese-Italian fusion works well. So, each gets a star.",2015-01-12 17:49:01

It was a little difficult to find as they didn't have the Sakana sign out front.  So, we drove around thinking we were in the wrong place and had to make a call to ask for directions.  Anyhow, we drove back and walked in.  We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful waitress.  We were given a lot of attention as we were the only customers in there.

Now, I am still a Sushi newbie.  I have only been to one other place, and I am sure I will compare all other experiences with that place.  The price of the rolls were cheap and I decided to just have 2 rolls.  I couldn't tell you what rolls I had nor what Michele and Eric had.  But, the price was right.  2 rolls for about $10.

But, I'll go out to Sansotei ANY DAY. The ramen here is simply amazing. Their broth is rich and satisfying, and the noodles are delicious. My favourite dish at Sansotei is Tonkotsu with thin noodles. The egg is creamy and I love the fungus in the soup. The fungus is crunchy and adds some texture to the ramen. My second favourite dish is the Spicy Tan Tan, which has ground pork. Although it can be quite spicy, the spice isn't overwhelming.

None of the ramen disappoints. I've tried almost all of the soups on the menu, and they're all incredible. You really can't go wrong. However, I would recommend sticking with the soup and foregoing the dumplings. They aren't anything to write home about.

Our food was stunning, even though I was served the smallest kumumoto oysters I've ever seen.  Three of us had fish and the other three had steaks.  Everyone was highly pleased with their meal, but again, Lloyd stole the show with amazing service, a great sense of humor, and attention to detail.  The six of us managed to get out of there for $600 before the tip, which I think is not too shabby given the $40-$50+ per entree cost.  The Dungeness crab appetizer was one of my highlights and my blackened Florida grouper was absolutely perfectly cooked to medium.

Even worse -- about 9 months after they blew the deal, I received a call from someone at Chapman asking ""How are you enjoying your new Hyundai Sonata""?  I told him that I didn't buy from them, and to please remove me from their contact list. Guess who I heard from again today -- 
""So, how are you enjoying the Hyundai Sonata you bought from us""
""I didn't buy a car from you""
""Oh, then why would you be in our system""?

The place itself really is hidden, for those not in the know, it's on side facing a Title Loans Shop.  Their sign is lower not on top of the building so easy to miss.  But parking isn't bad and definitely worth the trip.

This restaurant is located just inside Crystal's at City Center. There is patio seating which looks like it would be wonderful in spring or fall...too cold now :)

New location: 81 Underhill Drive (Donwood Plaza), right next to Valu-Mart

The new location has a lot more room, looks cleaner, and has seating! No more line-ups of people cramming out the door like at the old location.

According to one of the employees, the new location no longer sells fresh baked bread loafs. I don't know if this is permanent or not. That is just what I was told.

Anyway, on to my review.

* * *

Allwyn's is great! I've been going there for a while and it's quite delicious and affordable. Also, all of their prices already include tax which is convenient.

JAMAICAN BEEF PATTY ON COCOBREAD WITH COLESLAW:
($2.50 as of July 2014)

The first time I got this because my friend always grabs it. It's very good. I like the coco bread and slaw a lot -- one so soft and with a hint of coconut milk, the other a fantastic crunch with lots of flavour. It's pretty creamy coleslaw, so probably has quite a bit of mayo, but it's great. Even though it's gone up in price a bit now and then, it's still a great value -- you can get it without the slaw if you prefer, but I personally think the slaw is the best part. I've gotten it both 'spicy' and 'mild'. Both are very good options.

JERK CHICKEN SANDWICH WITH COLESLAW:
($4.20 as of July 2014)

The next time I went (only 2 days later), I got this sandwich which is popular with the Yelp community. It's okay. There was a decent amount of boneless juicy chicken in that same soft coco bread, with crunchy slaw rounding it out - but I certainly wasn't as impressed as others. It's not THAT good, it's messy as heck (the chicken and slaw fall out into the bag), and it's gone up in price twice since I started going there. Getting two of the beef patties on a bun is better value than one chicken sandwich, but it's your call. I just don't find this worth it.

LARGE JERK CHICKEN DINNER:
($9 as of July 2014)

I got the large dinner once, and while it was very tasty, the price was too steep for my liking. For what you get, I think $7.50 is more reasonable, but that's just me

Note:
On the weekends, they sometimes have two other varieties of patties: chicken and veggie. Both are really good. I recommend them if you want something other than the ""traditional"" beef patties.

Overall: I will continue going back! Donald is friendly (it's just him there most of the time) and I'm glad that with the renovations at the old plaza, Allwyn's was able to relocate to a great new spot!",2013-08-29 23:35:32

So if you visit this place and suddenly smell some noxious fumes , look around for a daffy, grinning bloke holding a shake.

For 3 bucks their sandwiches are awesome (only cash please... wha.??!!). Overall in the grand cosmic view of things actually ""Meh"". Barbeque pork is my fave but have tried most of their other varieties as well. 
I 've nailed down the reason for me liking the sandwich to the pickled daikon and carrots as well as their eggy mayo that they lather in, topped with their fresh cilantro.  The meat used has always been rather tough and unappetizing. 

However they have way more choices in terms of desserts smoothies baguettes. The ambience is very similar to a fast food joint in HK, South Korea etc.",2008-08-02 19:18:05

That means I'm intimately familiar with the coffee shop, but haven't spent much time in their other restaurants. I've been to the buffet a few times, along with the new Twin Creeks, but hadn't had the chance to make it to Mi Casa until last week. I had a $30 comp that was expiring soon, so I figured I'd stop after work, and have a steak at Twin Creeks. Well, I totally forgot that they are dark Mondays. I had been eying the chicken mole at Mi Casa for a while, wondering how it would stack up to my precious Papalote, so I figured what the hell, let's give it a run.

The *extremely hot* hostess sat me at a semi-booth near the front of the restaurant, but I felt that I was still very comfortably isolated from the casino. They have a nice entryway set up with a lot of big plants that do a pretty admirable job of not making it seem like you're not 15 feet away from the casino floor (but it's still there if you look). Decor was pretty nice, and in my opinion, classier than similarly priced mexican places. My waitress, who reminded me of a less-cordial version of Lurch, eventually dropped off the oft-mentioned tortilla chips & salsa and took my order, which consisted of beef flautas ($7-8) (sp?) and the chicken mole ($18). Chips & salsa turned out to be good, and I ate them throughout the meal - even desert. The flautas came out, but I quickly deduced that they were chicken, and not beef. I tried for a while to get Lurch's attention so that I could send them back, but when the futility of that became evident, I just decided to eat them anyway. They weren't bad, but definitely seemed on par to something I could pick up in the freezer aisle. After that, the very nice serving girl brought out the chicken mole. It seemed like a nice presentation, but ultimately the dish turned out to be just ""alright"". The chicken was cut into slices, and was OK at best, quality wise. The mole was not very chocolaty, and the cheese was very sparingly applied. As I was eating though, I did notice that the dishes were very cool, so a plus for that, I guess. Post-mole, Lurch came by and gave a cursory ask if I wanted desert, and seemed surprised when I took her up on it. I ended up with the fried ice cream ($6?), which was passable.

Overall, had I been paying cash for this meal, I would've thought it was a bit overpriced. That's not to say that it was expensive, but I'm just not sure if I would've been happy paying for what I received. I saw nothing to explain why the mole was so expensive, and the appetizer portion was not very large. High points include the chips, the plates, and the frequent, but mysterious trips the hostess made past my table. Food was decent. This review seems more negative now than I believe I felt when I was eating the meal, so it could just be that the food quality was overshadowed by the lack of server quality I experienced. I would go back again, but only because I pay for my food at the craps table and not the dinner table. 2.5 stars, rounded up for the hostess.",2008-10-06 21:43:11

I'm not sure if it's because we were there on a Friday night but the restaurant was extremely noisy and my friends and I had to yell at each other to be heard so this is not the place if you're looking to have a quiet meal. I would recommend trying out this place once just for the experience.

For the menu, I highly recommend the top sirloin and the grilled pineapple!

Whether the reviews are legit or not, this place is good.  Another review hinted at ""Tex Mex"" which makes me think of Larado's (which makes me think of a rock in my stomach), but this is more of the Taqueria El Jalapeno-style Mexican, and a step up from Tienda Los Gemelos style Mexican (and a step down from La Mestiza Mexican... but I would gladly eat at any of these places, any time!).  Wife liked it because it has more than the standard tacos/burritos/enchiladas than a lot of places (she got shrimp).  Kid one liked the chicken strips.  Kid two liked the monster sized burrito.  I liked the chicken molé.  

Between this place, Gloria's, and Taqueria Gonzalez, we're doing pretty well for Mexican in the west-side / Middleton area!

The girl serving us was very friendly and helpful, even offering up some tips. I went with the small mango cup with kiwi, blueberries, and strawberries. Per our server, you can have as many topics as will fit in the cup once you choose to pay for toppings. My boyfriend got a medium coconut with pineapple topping. Both were good, but a bit bitter (and pricey at over $11) for my taste.

This place definitely is not for everyone.  If you like Mickey-D's or In n Out then you probably should just keep on walking.  But if you like a burger that was made when you order it or fries that are real potatoes and don't taste like the cup they came in then this place could be a great option.

They are a little pricier than your average quick service joint, but its worth it.  The portions are HUGE, even if you order the ""regular"" fries and the ""little"" burger they are still BIG.  They don't charge per topping beyond the norm like Smashburger, and they have tons of toppings to choose from.  Would love to see a fried egg option, but other than that the majority of burger loving taste buds will find topping options that please them.  They have some non-burger choices as well, which is nice.  Hot dogs, grilled cheese (which people keep saying is a must try) and a veggie sandwich.

Eating here is a 5 napkin type experience, a lil messy, a lil crazy, but oh so yummy!  Hint: if you are transporting 5 guys in your car, definitely put something between the bag and your (clothes, passenger seat, floor mat, etc..)  the grease WILL leak through the bag.

As a former high school state track medalist this was a treat. My High School Phoenix Christian still dominates our division by design. I would run the 100 meters which back then was the 100 yard dash. The 220, long jump and several sprint relays. I was fast.

This weekend I enjoyed seeing hundreds of kids preform their best. 

Phoenix Christian senior sprinter Preston VanHofwegen, who is going to Azusa Pacific to play football in the fall, won the 400-meters with a personal best time of 49.45 seconds. You will be hearing about Preston in pro-ball in the near future.

Devon Allen the Brophy track star won a pair of state titles on Saturday and came a whisker away from two more, thrilling the crowd at the Division I state track meet at Mesa Community College. Brophy's tough.

As expected, Allen captured the 110- and 300-meter hurdle state titles. He dueled Deer Valley sprinter Trae Armstrong in the 100- and 200-meter dashes, losing both by a hundredth of a second. These were exciting races.

Congratulations to every participant.",2012-05-14 15:16:08

Update: the General Manager/Owner saw our review and was kind enough to give us a gift certificate to try them again. We had the sampler appetizer which was pretty good.

In terms of seating, there is indoor and outdoor tables available. The outdoor patio gets packed very quickly around 6pm on weekdays, so I recommend you get reservations if you don't want to wait. I was with a group of 4, arriving around 6pm on a Friday evening without reservations and we waited over 45 minutes just to get an outdoor patio table. 

The atmosphere is very energetic and lively, lots of chatter and mingling among an extensive selection of drinks, which makes it a great environment for dinner with friends, coworkers, or family. Highly recommend the super fresh House made Ginger Beer (non-alcoholic) for all the designated drivers out there. In terms of food, the entrees are filling and have nice presentation, however I didn't find the taste of the food extraordinary. I ordered the Smoked Brisket Bowl, which ended up not having as much flavor as I originally anticipated from reading its description on the menu. 

In terms of service, our waiter seemed impatient and preoccupied when he greeted us and took our orders. He also seemed annoyed when we requested for certain food allergy accommodations, which I thought was a very unprofessional attitude.

The refrigerated pre made items looked great so I might try one of those if I go again, I saw a Mac and cheese block the size of your head. 
Our lunch items weren't phenomenal. We had grilled cheese, short rib sandwich, and a veggie salad. The salad dressing was to die for, fresh lemon. The sandwiches had good crunchy bread but we did not feel they were worth the hefty price tag! My short rib & cheese sandwich alone was $15 without a side  each sandwich came with a few cucumbers in a salad of sorts-none of us cared for that. Thought it to be a weird touch.

WOW!  Wow! Wow! And WOW! I can officially say that I now had the BEST Korean BBQ of my lifetime. 

I was recommended to this place by numerous customers informing me that Hobak is one of the BEST Korean BBQ restaurant they've ever come to.  I decided to give it a try and the rest was history.

Quality: 5/5
110% OUTSTANDING! We got the beef combos and everything was top quality, including the flavors.

I was informed by our waitress that the beef ribs are actually marinated for two days prior to serving. Which makes it super tender and tasty.

Customer Service: 5/5
AMAZING! From the moment we walked in, to the minute we walked out.

The waiters and waitresses come over to your table and help you cook your meats.  Which I love, in addition, you never have to wait to flag someone down for condiments.

Price: 5/5
It is not a buffet, so once again, it depends on how much you can eat. Personally, we got the beef ""combo for two"" portion and we had leftovers. Which we were allowed to pack it to go.

Most importantly, you don't get nickel and dime to death. For example, unlike my previous non buffet Korean BBQ experience, steam rice are FREE here. In addition, lots of amazing free side dishes. Such as, soups, salad, pancakes (not the kind of pancakes you're thinking of, but super yummy) free desserts etc.

Like I said, in my opinion, super generous for a non buffet place. Love it!

Cleanliness: 5/5
The place was immaculate! Yes, including the restroom, the seating area and the grills as well.  

I noticed that there's complimentary toothbrushes (disposable ones), mouthwash and toothpaste in the restroom. So if you are that individual like me, who needs to brush his teeth after every meal, you are in great hands.

Tips:
Hobak does not hold back in every way you can imagine.  The atmosphere was awesome, not over crowded, especially during lunch time, which I am surprised with a place this great.  Maybe I was just lucky.  

One thing I love more than anything is that they have a vent on each table. Know what that means? You don't have to go home to take a shower after your meal so that you don't stink like a walking BBQ Grill. We will definitely be back.",2017-03-11 22:58:50

The toppings (including sauteed mushrooms and onions!) were plentiful without sliding apart in a giant heap, the bun was on the right side of dry, and the patty itself was juicy and well-seasoned. The only letdown was the suds on tap: where Limerick's has a massive list of beers, in tiny cramped font to fit them all on one page, Joyce has about five imports - it was a Guinness bought with some remorse.

I ordered the stuffed French toast which the menu describes as:  Two think slices of raspberry chocolate bread, soaked in a rich vanilla cinnamon custard, stuffed with sweet mascarpone cheese filling and served with warm maple syrup.

This was a large breakfast.  The mascarpone is flavored with raspberry also because it was a pink color.  There was some raspberry syrup drizzled over the slices and some powdered sugar.  The French toast was OK but it was a bit moist bordering on being soggy.  I did not use the syrup as I generally don't use maple syrup--real or phony.  The photo on the menu shows the toast decorated with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprig of mint.  Instead, there was a cup of butter and a sprig of parsley.

Pricing wasn't bad either; it was a total of $37 including tips and tax for two people. We had the marinated chicken feet (tasty and steamed well), Siu mai, ha gao, steamed pork ribs, and a few other dishes. We had around a total of 11 dishes, which isn't bad for the price.

As one might've guessed, Pamier Kabob boasts a lot of kabobs on its menu. I felt like a wrap, though, so I got the Chicken Tikka Wrap. I was asked how spicy I wanted it (always a good sign) and then the wait began.

It seems like the restaurant favors orders fulfilled via Ritual over those placed in store, as they put out a whole lot of takeout orders before I received my food, but the wait wasn't too bad so this is a minor complaint.

The wrap is just okay. It contains several chunks of dispiritingly dry chicken (ie expect to do a lot of chewing) and a generous portion of lettuce, onions, and tomatoes. The sauce is too bland to even mention, and the spice level was just barely adequate.

The only reason why they get a star from me is the bar atmosphere, they have a great bar with good happy hour deals, but that's it. 

Lets begin with the food, salsa and chips...absolute crap. The salsa tastes like canned crap from a 99 cents store, bland and just CRAP, I can go to Filiberto's across the street and find salsa 10 times better than what's at Loco's. The chips are salty as h***, tastes as if they poured the entire salt shaker into the basket, VERY SALTY, i'm not a goat, but thanks! I've been here for plenty of taco Tuesdays (mainly for the drinks). The tacos run between 1-2 bucks. The dollar tacos are shredded chicken or beef and the 2 dollar ones are shrimp, mahi mahi, and new york steak.I've tried all of the tacos, the shredded chicken and beef always dry and bland, same with the mahi mahi! The only tolerable tacos are the shrimp and new york steak, but once you go to a REAL Mexican restaurant, it makes those tacos look like poop! I've had their chimichanga's, again like another poster said about the beef, they put ground beef instead of shredded like what I expected and it sucked! I refuse to try anything from there again! If I go here it's only for happy hour once in a blue moon, but that's about it. Want to go to a real Mexican Restaurant try Los Taquitos off of 48th st and Elliot and La Canasta in Downtown, those are real Mexican restaurants.

The beer is cheap ($1-$2 bottle specials, $3.50 full-fare bottles) and the wings are certifiably jumbo. The wings *were* slightly over-fried, though, which dried out the wing a bit. They were also slightly over-sauced, so those watching their sugar intake may want to ask for 'light sauce'? Sauces are quality - on par with Buffalo Wild Wings - albeit a smaller sauce palette to choose from.

Carrots & Celery (0.99) are a fairly generous portion, and come out cold, fresh and carefully cut - about 12 big sticks. One Blue Cheese cup (0.89) is enough for two orders of Carrots & Celery. Makes you feel better about mowing down a dozen Mango Habanero wings. 

On a related note: Have you ever noticed how crappy the carrots & celery are at Buffalo Wild Wings? Everytime at BWW, no matter where in the country, the carrots are cracked and old, and the celery is brown and dirty. Seriously Grade C vegetable purveying - so weird!

Back to Wingstop: They've got free WiFi that's faster-than-you-think. I worked for an hour on my laptop at the bar and had front-row view of 3 different DirecTV screens. They've got the full $160/month DirecTV package going on here so that's awesome. There are a lot of TVs in this store. This would be the perfect secret SuperBowl party spot. (don't tell anyone!)

My wife and I decided to go to this location for my most recent birthday (May 2016).  We had made a reservation for 8:00 p.m. on a weeknight and were promptly seated.  However, a chef didn't show up to our table until 10:00 p.m.  Anybody for dinner at 10 pm lol?  The other people at our table and us kept looking at each other as our eyes glazed over and our heads began to nod off.  The waiter actually came by a few times and apologized - he asked what he could do to make it up.  I said I'd take another drink, which I assumed would be comp'd since the wait was so long.  Well, it wasn't.  My wife and I kept saying,"" Should we just leave?"" and we really were about to when a chef showed up.  So we plopped back down in our seats and our service began.  Food was good, chef was entertaining, etc...but waiting two hours for dinner wasn't much fun.

When I discovered this via the distribution page, I promptly planned a trip to Montreal to stock up on these fine notebooks. OK fine - I wasn't *that* impulsive, but I did incorporate my burning yen for pale-lined graph paper notebooks into my trip plan.

Montreal already has Essence Du Papier, which carries many, many brands of journals, agendas and fountain pens by reputable brands like Clairefontaine and Moleskine, but Nota Bene has so much more.

First of all, the store is pristine and everything is wonderfully organized. There are so many goddman notebooks to choose from you won't be able to settle on just one. I was in such a tizzy over the availability of the notebooks that the owner could hardly contain her giggles. She was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and even alerted me to the fact that the store has an online shop and delivers to Toronto. The upstairs was being used as an art space when I visited. Cool idea.

I ended up leaving with some Danish and German graph paper notebooks that were on sale for only $4 each, as well as some ink refills for my Lamy fountain pen and of course, the aforementioned Whitelines notebooks. I pretty much bought out the store. Trust me when I say these books are the BEST. The paper quality is unparalleled and it's such a treat to write on graph paper, without the distracting and harsh dark lines.

The waiting time can be super long depending on the time you go. Most of the time around 6 and after, the wait will be very long! BUT don't let that discourage you because once you get seated and try their sushi, it is definitely worth the wait since it's also AYCE. I like the nigiri sushi here compared to a few other sushi places here in Vegas! As for their rolls, I think I would say it is decent like any other place, but there are some other sushi restaurants that have better rolls in my opinion! 

A few of my favorites: 
Salmon 
Salmon belly 
Yuzu yellowtail 
Eel 
Oyster

I had the original flavor topped with mangoes.  Yummy, I sat there and ate the whole thing, thinking of my Yelp review and taking photos.

Sat down at a table in in front of the main bar/stage, and was ignored for 10 minutes.  My friend and I made our way to a side bar and settled down there.  

The bartender asks what we would like, and with my comment in my previous review (""Servers have also told me that the 1/2 off price applies to mixed drinks with 1 spirit, though I haven't confirmed this."") I asked the bartender if I could get a Manhattan at happy hour prices.  The bartender looked at me, and I could tell this was going to be a chore.  She said that she wasn't sure; I thought that she meant she didn't know if it would be at happy hour price.  

Nope.  Well, yes, she wasn't sure about the happy hour pricing.  But her first concern was ""What's a Manhattan?""  ... ... ...That's the kind of person who will ask what you think of their personality, and I would respond by patting their head and telling them that they were very pretty.  After staring at her and wondering how she got her job, I explained what a Manhattan was, and told her that I wanted bourbon whiskey.  She then proceeds to another bartender at one of the outdoor bars and has him make the drink for her.  She comes back and tells me that yes, it will be at happy hour pricing, but they had to use Jack to make it discounted.  Well, Jack isn't bourbon.  But hell, at least I finally got a drink.

Star gets knocked off for having incompetent bartenders.  I'm thinking that this lady was only capable of making whats on the menu and opening beer bottles.  Which when I noticed, was what all the other guys were drinking at the bar I was sitting at.",2010-04-21 20:01:45

yvPjHDwnpAodTZRYS2P_mg,KekQwlBlJlgzaHLfhXt8Bg,lwpQQflP1CGJPV7QLybzOg,4,1,0,0,"Went there the other night, had Pizza and wings.  The pizza was ok-good, really not the style I like, so if I were you, reading the review, I'd take that wiht a grain of salt.  It was large and very thin.  Like 1/2 as thick as a Rosati's.  The good news is the price is much mroe reasonable than Rosatis.

Now to the really good news.  The wings.  Very, very good, like a 14 out of 15 on my proprietary scale of wings.  Would have been 15 out of 15 if they had left them in the fryer a few moments longer.  they bake the wings ahead of time, then fry them quickly to crisp them before adding a perfect, thin sauce (not the ketchup like stuff you get at some ""wings"" palces"".  These are, in my opinion, some of the best I've had in Phoenix.  Let's give it another shot to ensure they're consistent... and ask them to drop them in the frier a little longer!

The other reason I gave them 4 of 5 - and if they ONLY did wings they'd already have a 5/5 - was I don't care for the happy hour policy.  I understand it, but I think they could be more accomodating.  You see, to get the HH hour pricing, you need to sit on the ""bar"" side.  However, if you are there with anyone under 21 you can only sit on the restaurant side.

While I apprecaite that I don't want to necessarily expose kids to the bar scene, at the same time, I don't feel I should have to pay more just for travelling with kids.  Make the HH prices restaurant wide, and we'll be good, or let us take kids into the bar area.  Kona does it!",2011-05-05 00:32:59

dfTvgsPLORSm1dK9ouyN5Q,tL4NRC4uraCxjF8ZQ6GTTw,lPK3iqwVwFPOMswRrejwZQ,1,0,0,1,"Tonight I was craving a burger and a little bourbon. I did a search near my apartment and saw there was a PT's. I didn't have major hopes but PT's is known for having a good burger so I thought why not. 

I go into this location and it's old old old. The place REEKS and is dark. I over look that part and find a table near the bar. Of course there is a dirty ashtray and no chair so after I move the ashtray and get a chair at the bar. I sit down. The bartender comes to the end of the bar (doesn't even come out from behind it) and hollers over at me, ""What you drinking?"" I ask her what some of her better bourbons are. She begins to mumble and babble about everything except bourbon. First she starts with Wild Turkey. I point out that that isn't bourbon but Canadian whiskey. She then babbles about a couple of other strange flavored whiskey. I tell her that that's ok and I get up to go look at their bar selection. Immediately I notice Bullit. I have a better feeling but am wondering why she had droned on about other things when there was Bulleit sitting right there.

I order a Bulleit on the rocks and ask for a menu. She quickly tells me that the only food they have are ""personal pizzas"" and something else but I had stopped listening. I asked her, ""Isn't PT's known for their burgers."" She mumbles something about how that location doesn't have a working kitchen. Of course that means I was probably being offered a frozen pizza cooked in what amounted to a microwave or toaster oven. Gee, thanks. I told her to cancel the bourbon and I got my stuff and left. On the way out some jerk at the bar made a rude comment, which only help solidify that this place is crap.

I'm sorry but in a city like Las Vegas, I am appalled at an establishment that (1) Has such crappy staff that they can't even answer an easy questions like, ""What bourbons do you have?"" and (2) Is so ridiculous that you don't have a working kitchen but offer some frozen crap because you ""HAVE"" to offer food. I will NEVER step foot near this place and am hesitant to EVER go to a PT's again. I wound up at Ace's and Ales and am SOOOOOOO glad I did.",2013-02-11 05:36:05
Qci8iL682mtQcPA6fuGifQ,gELwad3XC2fthoffd5Kafg,2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA,5,2,0,0,"One of my favorite food destinations in town! This is my go to destination for Middle Eastern food. Great quality, nice variety, excellent prices.

I went to Haji Baba recently and wondered what I had written in my review of the place. I looked on Yelp and realized that, despite the many times I've visited over the last couple of years, I've never actually written a review. So now I'm fixing that little oversight.

I first came to Haji Baba while living out-of-state on the recommendation from a friend who made sure to come here at least once or twice very time he was in town. And I was immediately impressed by the place. I've since tried nearly everything on the menu, and I'll keep coming back on a regular basis.

Appetizers: The hummus is a fantastic texture and is a great addition to any dish, really. The tabbouli is the best I've had; it's not too oily and has just mild enough of a flavor to not be overpowering. The baba gannoush is nearly as good as the hummus. I know I've had several other appetizers, and they're all great.

Main dishes: I think I've worked through just about everything on the menu, although I wondered the last time I went if I have tried the Lamb Tongue sandwich. There's enough doubt in my mind that I'll try it next time I go. As far as the sandwiches go, my favorite is the chicken shawarma. It's a nice, thick sandwich for not much money, and the ingredients are all excellent. Tender and juicy chicken, lettuce, pickles, sauce. Excellent! The gyros, beef shawarma, chicken and beef kebabs, and other sandwiches are all tasty as well. As for the plate meals, I'd recommend the kebab combination plate first. It has a heaping of chicken and beef kebabs, and it comes out nice and hot with some sides. All delicious!

I've seen several recommendations of the baklava on here, and I wonder if I had a bad batch or something. The one time I tried baklava--which I generally love--it was dry and not very flavorful. I even tried a couple of varieties. Maybe it's time to try it again...

I like the small grocery store here as well. There are a bunch of lovely spices and hard-to-find imported items, and the prices are pretty reasonable.

Love it.",2015-06-03 17:30:24

We've rented out the 20 person Karaoke room 2x. It includes a stripper pole, for those of you willing to try and comes with a large sushi platter for the room! Our waitress, this past time, was AMAZING and was willing to work with us. Everyone got a separate check AND they were able to split the cost of the room between everyone, so not one person was footing the bill and had to collect cash from everyone!  The only downside to renting the room is I feel like Geisha is never fully prepared for the largest room. Each time I've gone, we've had less than 20 people and they cannot keep up with our orders. I don't mind as much, except that some people weren't getting there food until we only had 20 minutes left in the room. (for us slow eaters, that's not enough time).

I've had numerous experiences with them that ranged from clockwork-like shuttling to complete fiascos over the many years I've resided in Pittsburgh. 

I'm also surprised that my latest experience with Yellow Cab, my first in 5 years, went famously well. 

Last week, I attended a concert at Mr. Smalls in Millvale, and if you're familiar with that quaint, Old World borough, you'll know that public transit there goes to sleep after 11PM. 

The show ended at 11:10. 

Crikey.

Luckily, before work that morning, I looked up YC's number and saved it into my cell phone, so when I found myself in a transportation jam, I dialed them immediately. 

A woman who sounded like Marsha Warfield came on the line. When I told her that I was at Mr, Smalls and didn't know the street address offhand, she assured me that I would be picked up quickly. 

It turned out that a number of my fellow metal fans (folk metal and pagan metal specifically. yes, we love our subgenres) had the same idea, so less than a minute after I called, a taxi driver who could vocally pass for the late Barry White told me he was very close, and before I even had time to wonder when he'd actually arrive, there he was in a car that sparkled like daybreak sunshine at 3/4 of an hour before midnight. 

A light, soothing conversation ensued (all I told him was that I saw a band from Switzerland since even I am not sure how to pronounce their name and am pretty certain few Pittsburghers know who the hell they are anyway), and despite my man's fancy, fast, 'n furious drivin', I felt completely at ease. And via the brilliant invention of GPS, I didn't even need to tell him anything more than my street address. 600 seconds later, I was quietly dropped off in front of my Beechview home. 

""You are CLASS, man,"" I told this hefty, jovial fellow whose name I have forgotten. 

""Oh dude, it's no bother. Just be sure to treat that lady right, and try not to wake her.""

Chuckling, I thanked him, handed him a 20 dollar bill, thanked him again, told him to keep the change (the fare was $16.32. don't ask how I remembered that), got into the house, changed into PJ's, and slipped between the sheets... only to hear my babydoll sigh. 

Ugh. Busted.

Please make sure you specifically ask for the Restaurant Week menu so you get the deal you came for! I really hope this isn't a new trend for restaurants during Restaurant Week, it's so tacky!",2011-07-17 15:44:49

It's not the best Italian food in the world, nor did I expect that from a small, tourist-friendly walk-in establishment on Fremont Street.  But it puts out respectable food at decent prices with better-than-average service.  

My wife and I found this place based on a recommendation from a Tix-4-Tonight worker at the 4Q.  For $2, we bought a voucher that gave us half off a second entree.  Why not, right?  We tried Luna Rossa, liked it, and have gone back a half-dozen times in the past year or so.  

After a few hours on Fremont, I'm never really in the kind of shape to give a review worthy of submission to Food & Wine magazine.  What I can report is that having grown up on Italian food in northern N.J., I can safely recommend the risotto, carbonara, bolognese, and rigatoni al funghi.  

One weird thing I ran into:

I bought a large beer at the ABC store on Fremont.  I then walked down to Luna Rossa to have dinner.  They told me I had to finish it before I could come in.  Fine, whatever.  Then, I noticed that other people were bringing in their drinks (the football beers, the oversized fruity drinks, etc. sold on Fremont).  I asked the waitress why my low-rent beer was being discriminated against.  She told me that they allowed drinks purchased on Fremont into the restaurant (the touristy-type drinks) but not cans and bottles.  Personally, I prefer policies that make sense.   

Again - don't forget to buy the voucher and save some $$.

My wife and I are headed back to Fremont in a couple of weeks.  I'll see you at Luna Rossa!",2013-03-04 19:10:28

I was the DD and had to ask for water 4 times before I walked downstairs & got it myself. Guacamole had lettuce in bottom of bowl so it wasn't as full as it looked. The quest was tasty.

1) It's not Applebee's or Chili's or Marie Callendars.
2) Quality ingredients. I ordered the Turkey Pesto Ciabatta thinking it was shaved turkey lunch meat...it was freakin' turkey breast sliced from a fresh cooked turkey. The avocado was nice and green, not brown. The basil was the freshest I've ever seen.
3) They bake their own breads (the carrot raisin bread they give you is THE BEST carrot bread I've ever had in my life and my mom was a baker).
4) French Onion soup doesn't get any better than this.
5) The zucchini sticks. I crave them often. I can taste them if I think about them enough. That's power!
6) The service is always phenomenal.
7) Everyone I go with always has a hard time picking something from the menu because it's ALL GOOD. Anything they DO pick is always great.
8) You can customize anything, unlike a lot of other places. Change your cheese, trade sides, ask for more bread (free!).
9) All of this quality and the prices are still very low.

Spoke with Carl and he promised I'd have the broken LCD fixed by Wednesday (this was on a Sunday). I told him the second would just be a backup so no worries on getting that back at the same time. He told me that because I had two computers he'd give me a discount. Sweet!

Maybe because I'm new to AZ I find it weird when you sit at the sushi bar and get completely ignored by the sushi chefs.. because in any sushi bar that is of quality the prized seats are the bar.

 I observe the fish and they are run of the mill (I'm a prior sushi chef) and recognize nothing to write home about... nigiri isn't offered and there is a reason.. generally when you sit at a bar seat, you are offered ginger and wasabi by the chef, and a cordial conversation on ordering is normal..none of that occured here.. -2 stars

Move to the table experience changes..Waitress takes our order and drinks... they have some  decent sake, and they look to have a full bar in the back. 2 star...

i went for my birthday which was also the start of spring restaurant week. understandably, they were busy. my husband and i arrived early for our reservation, checked in and took a seat at the bar. i ordered a specialty cocktail which was supposed to contain muddled mint and a sugared rim. it arrived with no suragered rim and whole mint leaves. fine. it was still good.

dinner time came and with it being restaurant week, we looked over the menu. had i ordered off the resturant week menu instead of the regular menu, i would have paid more for the three items than had i just ordered straight off the menu. bad form! 

so my mother and i both ordered the red pepper cannelloni. my huband ordered the green chili pork (?) off the restaurant week menu and my brother got the barbeque pork. my brother was the only one who liked his food. the green chili was runny/oily and lacked good flavor.

the canneloni had ZERO flavor. amazingly bland vegetables inside an amazingly bland red pepper with an amazingly bland sauce on the side. no good. the server (who was very nice but very rushed and difficult to find) immediately offered to get us something else whcih we appreciated. i got the chopped salad which was fine. nothing special. my mom got the chicken and dumplings - again, lacking any significant flavor. the manager came over, apologized for the cannelloni dishes and said they've been experienceing problems and very mixed reviews on vegetable dishes since they opened. i suggest getting to work on something good containing vgetables. this is NOT going to cut it.

dessert was also ho-hum. the pecan/fig pie had a great filling but a rock solid crust . my husband said the bacon s'mores were too much work - messy and not very good.

Ironically, I sat next to a bartender I recognized from La Paz at Metropolitan. I remember mentioning to him, when at his restaurant, how cold & refreshing their bottled beers are. He explained they make a conscious effort to keep their coolers at a certain temperature. Kennedy's needs to do the same!
My wife and I ordered food (this was the first time in all of our visits) and, the food was terrible. I am sorry to say that because I like this place, but it was terrible. I figured an Irish-themed restaurant would have a good fish sandwich. I was so, so wrong. It was a frozen piece of fish (geez, it even was those terrible triangle frozen fish pieces) on a bun! And the fries , well, some weren't even cooked fully. I was very disappointed that an Irish restaurant would serve a fish sandwich of that poor quality. Very disappointing.
I will probably still go back  because of the location, the outdoor patio and the friendliness of the staff (especially the bartenders on the patio). I will hope for a much colder beer and just won't order food. Sorry Kennedy's, I wanted it to be better, but I am just being honest!",2013-11-10 15:42:23

1. Pick your bowl, burrito, salad, or tacos
2. Pick your rich (brown or white)
3. Pick your beans (black or pinto)
4. Pick your meat (chicken, steak, sofritas, barbacoa, carnitas, or veggies)
5. Pick your spice level (mild, medium, hot)
5. Add toppings (corn, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, guacamole: which is extra $)

And add chips and salsa, or a drink if you like!

They also have lemon on the side by the utensil area as well as your different kinds of tobasco, YUM!

So, we made the cold trek and soon found a long line at the restaurant so we knew it was going to be good. Anticipation all around. BUT THEY ONLY ACCEPTED CASH WHICH WE BOTH DIDN'T HAVE! (Super Fail!)

So, we searched around on Yelp for the next nearest, good-reviews-on-Yelp place and found ourselves at Yumei. We walked in and I was instantly hit with a fake pot-pouri smell...the kind used in bathrooms. We waited for a couple of minutes before being seated in a private booth which was great - there are 4 in total. Menus were quickly brought and we decided to order: Spice Age Tofu, California and Chicken Teriyaki Lunch Box, Bulgogi and Tempura Lunch Box (which comes with salad and soup).

The menu is very, very extensive so my review basically is limited to the items we ordered and may not necessarily represent the entire food choices here. The Spicy Tofu was really gross: soggy, fried, COLD tofu that was covered in thick ""spicy"" sauce that only made the tofu soggier. My chicken was all white meat so it wasn't the chicken teriyaki I was expecting (dark meat with that bit of crispy skin on top). Bland, boring, and nothing special. My boyfriend said his meal was all right but his Bulgogi looked dry and sad.

In total, our 3 dishes with one large sparkling water came out to $45 not including tip which I thought was expensive for what we ordered. We even wanted to order more food as we were still hungry but the waitress already brought our bill and we didn't want to start again.

Service. I can only describe it as average. Nothing personal. I had ordered green tea and there was no checking-up to see if I wanted re-fills. In fact, there was no checking up on all. There was only one waitress serving tables so I would imagine service to be quite slow on busier time periods.

All in all, I wouldn't come back here as compared to other Japanese restaurants I have been to, it's just not up to par. If you like fusion cuisine, then you might want to try Yumei as it carries Korean dishes as well.",2011-10-24 13:24:33

Obviously you don't have very high expectations when going to a place like this.. it's basically a glorified bar.. and this location is on the Las Vegas Strip...and to basically mimic what another reviewer said: the service was sloooow - and the food was GROSS. 

I ordered a 'chicken fajita burrito'.. which came to he table as a 'BEEF fajita burrito'.. about 35 minutes after it was ordered..AND it had CHILI all over it... like beef chili.. slopped over the top.. along with fake canned cheese.. which I guess would be fine, if that is what I had ordered.. and i was extremely drunk.  It was incorrect.. it looked unappealing.. but hey, I gave it a chance. Sufficed to say, I won't be going back for that particular menu item. (I did mention to the server that it was incorrect... he claimed they sent the wrong one, and I said I would deal with it.. but on the bill, it was listed as BEEF Fajita Burrito..as in.. he ordered the wrong item and lied to me about it.) Mistakes happen.. I get it... I'm just sayin.

The 2 friends I was with, both decided it was pretty bad service as there were missing utensils, drinks for the 3 of us were coming one at a time.. and there really seemed to be no excuse for the lack in service, because they were not at all busy.   We all agreed that the drinks weren't bad.. and the outdoor patio is a nice attraction to ''people watch' from .. but other than that.. I will not be eating any of their ""signature"" dishes again...ever. They had chicken tenders with fries on the menu, and if I ever visit this spot again to have drinks.. and decide that I am hungry (and very lazy, because there are 10 better choices less than 50 feet away, ) I will be having those.

Check in is usually quick, employees are pretty professional, and i've never ever had any issues with noise or any other problems here.

Hidden tips: 
*Upon entering the main parking garage you WILL be asked for room key or a reservation or a players card to park, just show that & you're good to go

*They will serve you meals right at your machine or even at the bar from their new classy restaurant.

*On certain days if youre lucky enough to be there theyll serve you free pie, ice cream, white castles etc for various occasions.

*Despite distant past concerns from folks, this hotel and the areas around it are completely safe and nothing to worry about.

*Machines are pretty good here, consistently not just a couple times, it doesnt mean you'll always win, but ive won here more than anywhere else.

*You will need your room key to activate the elevator (guest safety)

*The cabana suites across the street are very unique, nowhere else in Vegas quite like it.

*Im guessing the scent in the air is similar to Dior Addict

*Ive encountered NO other hotel in town that will put mints on your night stand ..just for you, nice touch!!

Back in the land of the NorthEast, where Dunkin Donuts not only are at home on the city block and suburban strip malls, but alive and well underground in subway stations, convenience stores, and swear to christ, atm outlets, you get used to their brand of crank-sprinkled coffee and perfect little munchkin happy meals.

Seriously, with their big puffy logo in that sprinkle-shade of pink, whose mom wasn't the shit when she rolled in w/that cardboard lunchbox pail of fucking perfect snotball round donutholes a la munchkins, and how much it sucked if your teacher insisted on passing around the container instead of letting the fattest kid win w/the prized chocolate glazed hole, and you were at the end of the row with the plain donuthole. 

Having a Dunkin Donuts out here on Mill Ave brings me a giddy joy that I really cannot explain. From their french cruellers (which I used to get at WaWa at 3am), Egg Crossaint Wiches (best breakfast before bed drunk snack ever), to their classic chocolate glazed chocolate cake donuts, and their huge, doughy bagels that are actually pretty amazing (the everything bagel or bust bitches). It is a true can't miss. Every body who hates junk food, fried carbs, coffee, when you wiggle one of those beautiful Dunkin Donuts boxes in front of their upturned noses, they melt like sprinkles on Arizona pavement-of course you want a fucking Boston Creme! Do not deny thyself!

And their coffee is legendary for being really really good, the blue collar mans brew of choice, I have no idea why it is so good. I really think they sprinkle crack in it, b/c once you have it, you start to crave it. If they come out w/an expose of rat poison and feces in their beans, I will read the expose while drinking their delicious caffienated poison, then ask for seconds.

I was miffed that this location didnt offer seating-sometimes you just wanna grab a donut and coffee w/your honey on a weekday and head out, but I guess with the ridiculous fake street kids that have outfits from Hot Topic lingering on Mill all the time, I can't blame them.

Everyone working here was incredibly friendly and accommodating... Service with a smile :) 

This is a great place for big groups to come and share many dishes. The menu is in all chinese on the wall, and while they offer an English menu, I recommend you bring along someone who is fluent. (or just knows what they're doing)

The food is authentic and they offer complimentary tea with your dinner. If you pay in cash, you get a 5% discount.

As soon as we step inside they start making our mango lassi's and nan bread. We don't even have to ask for it. I love it. There's no other restaurant that I would recommend more than this one. Everything about this place is awesome and leaves you wanting to come back everyday. There was a week where we actually came 4 times. If you're craving indian, this is the spot to go to! The desserts are pretty darn good here too. I get rice pudding and mix it with fruit custard and a few pieces of milk candy. Did I mention this place is affordable? It's like 10 bucks per person and if you go as a family of three they might give you a special price if you ask them about it and go there often. The restaurant is always clean. They have a television that is always on either one of two things, indian music videos or WWE wrestling. I prefer the wrestling but the music videos are cool to watch when eating this type of food.

The server was a white male and he did not know the thai words for certain foods and was very confused on our order - we ordered tom kai gai (coconut soup with chicken) and then larb gai (a chicken salad).

He came over every 2-3 minutes and was almost smothering.
The tom kai gai was super coconutty but needed some acid to it - lime juice. The larb gai was served heaped on the lettuce, instead of the lettuce next to it, so it was hard to eat.

We luckily came here with a Groupon which included two appetizers, a shared salad, two entrees, and a dessert. We rounded out our meal with a couple of drinks, the bf had the pineapple basil cocktail while I had the Melon Mule. Both were strong and complex. 

Our meal: 
Starters: 
Crab cake with pecan remoulade: the crab cake was very hearty and had a nice consistency. The pecan remoulade was too sweet for me, this was on the side and smothered on the mixed greens. I prefer something spicy with my crab cakes. 
French Onion Soup: oh the Gruyere! was very filling and had great flavor from all those caramelized onions 

Salad: 
Cobb Salad: not impressed. The dressing would have been good if it was more on the champagne side than olive oil. But it was very fresh

Entrees (I was full as hell at this point and only nibbled my entree..its ok, midnight munchies)
Just for the Halibut: great dish name! but the halibut was a little underseasoned and overcooked. the potato cake was delish and the tomato sauce was also good. A bite with all components together, great! 
Pan chicken: true bf loved this fresh! Completed with some roasted potatoes and carrots. The chicken was mostly white with some dark. This however is not reheat/left over friendly. The pan sauce gets really easy after the microwave. 

Dessert: 
Mom's Apple Cake: wow very good! Props to the mom who created this! Great texture and flavor. Love apple and caramel, this is your deal. 

All in all, a great meal! Will be back for more! If you are dining with a groupon, fast! Coming in less than ravaged is a mistake! So much food!",2016-04-30 14:06:57

Ten minutes later we got a call from the driver, telling us he was at the restaurant, and they no longer carried the entree I had ordered from Foodie Call's online menu.

The portions are large, particularly for the price.

Pretty basic sushi rolls that aren't incredible or spectacular in any way, shape, or form.

If you're not intrepid enough to chance liquid spewing all over you, I would recommend ordering the fried dumplings - they are less likely to end up on your clothes, and they are also probably closer to what you think of when you think ""dumpling"".

I want to ask, 'why haven't I been here before??' but the answer's pretty simple. This is not what you think of when you think of 'Mt. Washington Restaurants.' It's a low-key sort of place that's on a back street and you'd almost miss it if you weren't looking for it. But inside, it's like you walked into a big family dinner, and all your favorite relatives are there.

When we arrived for our 8:30pm reservations, the dining room was PACKED. There were several giant parties (one of whom turned out to be host to a surprise engagement!), but we were seated right away, and from the moment our server Chris approached our table, I knew we were in for a treat.

While Chris was opening our wines (oh yes, lest I forget to mention, IT'S BYOB!!) we chatted with him about our mutual love for the Food Network. This all began to make sense as soon as he described the night's specials to us. It is a wonderful thing to have a server who is passionate about the food he will be bringing you, and that's exactly what we had with Chris. He described every dish to us in detail as if he was a chef on Chopped and he had just prepared it for the judges.

The decision was tough, but eventually my two dining companions and I settled on our meals. We started with an order of the antipasti - flavorful and fresh, but not so huge a portion that you spoil your appetite - and the fried zucchini. OH that fried zucchini! Crispy, savory, just lightly fried, and accompanied by a wonderful chunky marinara sauce. And at only $8.95, you can't go wrong. Promise me right now that when you come here, you will order the fried zucchini!

We were having a celebratory dinner, so we were taking our time, and Chris really helped that happen. The pacing of the meal was just right: we had enough time to enjoy each course before the next arrived, and there was no pressure to choose our meals too quickly even though the restaurant was crowded.

We enjoyed their crispy, buttery garlic toast alongside our house salads (excellent house Italian salad dressing!) as we waited for our entrees.

Here was where the little snag came in: my girlfriends' meals came out first, and my chicken parm was nowhere in sight. Chris quickly explained that something had gotten mixed up in the kitchen and it would be just a short time. Since we were taking our time chatting and pacing out the meal, it wasn't a problem.

But even though we were in no rush, Chris wasn't satisfied with our having to wait for my plate to come out separately from the others. He not only comped my meal as a courtesy, he treated all three of us to desserts on the house! I realize that mistakes happen in restaurants, especially on busy nights, and I always try to be understanding, but this extra step just meant so much to me. It really showed how important customer service is to this restaurant and its staff and how far they are willing to go to make a mistake right.

Now. About that chicken parm....

Let me just say that it was WELL worth the wait!! I am a little picky about red sauce, but this was off the charts. Hearty and savory and spiced just the right way. Whatever you didn't fit on your fork, you just HAD to dunk your garlic toast in. The breading on the chicken was light, the meat was cooked perfectly so that you barely needed to use a knife to cut the chicken. To be honest, I reeeeeally regretted my decision earlier in the night that I would take half home for my husband to have for dinner!

From start to finish, our dinner at La Tavola Italiana was wonderful. Great service, excellent food, and an atmosphere that made you feel welcome as soon as you walked through the door.

Wow this place is simply delicious. I don't know why there are negative reviews. Yes if you order in store, you will have to wait as the calzone's are made to order so expect a while wait. Otherwise this place is well worth it. The calzones, are cooked fresh to order, plenty of ingredients for the stuffing and simply delicious. The best is the hot box deal which gets you a classic calzone, can of pop or bottle of water, and a choice of side. I went with the combat which had pepperoni, mushroom, green pepper, and sausge with spices/mozzarella. I felt there was a perfect mix of ingredients, not too little and not too much. I did not find that it was dry at all and the marina was a great side. I also went with the cajun fries, nothing special here a little soggy by the time I had to eat it. They also have other promotions where you can get a calzone and cheese stix for 10 dollars which is enough for 2 people to share. I did have to wait 10-15 minutes for my order with no one else in the shop so I would recommend ordering online or call ahead. Staff was friendly otherwise.

Pro: Fresh made to order calzone, the hot box or zone/stix is a great deal, free parking

Cons: Very long wait time if you decide to order in store, your best bet order online

Hidden gem:
Everyday specials like the hot box and zone/stix are the way to go.",2014-11-25 23:30:08

We went there based on yelp reviews but most items are no longer on their dim sum menu.  Their food was just ok and their dim sum was not exceptional like many reviewers had recommended.  Maybe it was available a year ago when they first opened but they definitely did not keep up with all the items.  The decorations were just average. Maybe they are cleaner and nicer than most Chinese restaurants.  There is nothing here that really stands out.  They just sell average dim sum and have the same menu as Fisherman's clubhouse at night.  Many people ate the crab and lobster for lunch which I think is just too much food for a simple lunch.   I guess a lot of people like to impress others.  There are way too many restaurants in Richmond Hill.  The competition is just too much.   There are so many other choices of restaurants that you don't need to come here.

We ordered the vinegared cucumbers, veg dumplings, and seaweed salad for starters. All three dishes had great flavor. I only got one dumpling, because my husband cleaned the plate in two minutes. For mains, we ordered the veg curry and kimchi ramen bowl. The veg curry had a great Indo-inspired flavor, with just the right amount of kick.

It's located in a plaza, but the outer windows are pretty much blacked out - couldn't tell if the restaurant was open from the outside.

We were seated right away, and it was pretty busy for a Wednesday evening. Our server was attentive at first, grabbed our drinks.. but then totally forgot about us for the rest of the evening! We weren't in a hurry so it was no big deal, but was almost funny towards the end ""Did she forget about us or what?""

The wine selection was TINY! Large selection of bottled wine, but per glass was very limited. I ordered the Cabernet and I wasn't too happy with it. Wasn't high quality and I thought it was a relatively small glass for $6.99. 

The food took a while to come out - but it was good! Very high quality, not huge portions. Great flavor, great spice as well.

And I also found out that it's not entirely correct that the two Sushi Mons are not related.  Apparently the old manager of this Sushi Mon on Sahara started up the Sushi Mon in Henderson - there may have been like some sort of payment or franchise type agreement.  

Currently, the two are separately owned and run, but there is a little bit of a relationship there as you can see.  However if you ask them they will say they are not related.

BEIGNETS DU JOUR: Our pick was the raspberry jam-filled version, which was tasty but served cold, which we found odd. Feel they would have been even better warm.
ROASTED CAULIFLOWER SOUP: Beautifully smooth texture, subtle and delicate, topped with toasted walnuts for extra texture and flavor.
CORNED BEEF AND SPINACH BENEDICT (SPECIAL): Very tasty, the beef was tender and flavorful and balanced out well with the spinach. Hollandaise was rich, portion was generous, eggs cooked perfectly. 
MERGUEZ SAUSAGE HASH: Delightfully spicy hash topped with over-medium eggs and served with toast. Homey but well-executed, almost overlooked this dish on the menu.
POULET ET DES GAUFRES: Roasted chicken and bacon-chive waffles. The roasted chicken is excellent but combined with the incredible gravy, it is elevated to decadent! Waffles were just okay, liked that they had a bit of a savory element to them but felt the chive flavors were under pronounced. That gravy though is crave-worthy!
BRIOCHE DOREE(?): Bread pudding made with French toast, topped with caramelized pineapples and served in marshmallow. Tasty but not my thing, the bread pudding itself was cooked perfectly but neither the pineapple nor the marshmallow flavors really worked for my palate. 

Service was understandably more casual for brunch than dinner. Patio seating is available when weather is appropriate, and the setting and view are gorgeous.

But as a professional service, I should not have to monitor the if the job is being done or not.

Prior to moving in, we noticed a few dead roaches and one which was alive. The guy from HDE was in and out of the house in about 5 minutes and I can't recall if he sprayed the exterior. Fast forward two weeks... no dead roaches in the house... only alive ones. AWESOME! Again... not even certain if he sprayed or not as I don't recall seeing any wet areas from the spray.

There was barely any seasoning

From a food safety standpoint, the raw steak was placed on the same surface as one that used for cooked food.  I saw the cook place the raw steak on the mat, use a knife to cut the package, took the steak from the package with the same tongs that were used to grab cooked burgers from the grill.  This plastic cutting mat was the same one that was used where cooked roasted chicken was placed lying flat before it was cut.  

Even though the steak was medium rare, it tasted burnt.  All I can taste is burnt charcoal hours after this meal.

I came here last Saturday night on a whim and ordered 1 slice of cheese, 1 slice of everything, 1 garlic knot and 1 double stuffed all meat pizza and I about fell over from all the tastiness!

You might be wondering if I ate all that myself and the answer is of course not! I ended up splitting it with my hubby.

Now let me tell you how pizzawesome this pizza was!!! As soon as I sank my teeth into this light thin crusted saucy cheesy pizza I was instantaneously transported to my childhood when I remember eating pizza just like this. Wow!!!! I was transported by pizza! 

What a miracle to find a place that actually makes pizza the way it's suppose to be made. Freaking frack! Everything about this pizza oozes perfection! Kid you not!

The taste of the crust is flaky, crispy yet tender. The amount of sauce is not overwhelming nor too little, also the amount of cheese is also perfect, smooth in texture and amazingly great taste.

Some of you might think, but this is just pizza! No big deal. What's the difference? Well let me tell you that all pizzas are not created equal and I believe I have found the perfect pizza place in Las Vegas.

I've eaten at so many pizza joints around town and even in CA and I have to say that I have yet to find a pizza that can match Rocco's NY Pizza.

I swear I've found pizza heaven and I highly highly highly recommend this pizza joint. I promise you won't regret it. I seriously can't wait to sink my teeth into another pizza!

So, after about 5 min. more of me staring at her, waiting to be acknowledged, I finally had to get up and ask for a menu myself. She slid it over to me and said ""Have you decided what to order?."" I said, ""I don't know yet, you just handed me the menu."" She walked back to the other side of the bar like she had anything better to do than serve me, and took another shot. 
After I browsed the menu, I ordered a really yummy bacon burger w/ blue cheese. 
Oh, It gets better... 
After eating it, I handed her my debit card. She said I couldn't use it because the system was down, and she pointed at the ATM machine. I said, ""isn't there a fee to use that? There was.. it was $4! So instead of comping my Pepsi for the inconvenience, or even apologizing, her exact words were- ""yah, it sucks"". 
So.. In conclusion: 
The food, it was pretty tasty, but that doesn't matter. If you are running a business where you let your employees get drunk, if they are rude, and ignore customers, I won't come back. It's all about making the customer feel welcomed. That's how you get repeat business! Like I said, there were 3 other people besides me there. That place should've been packed for lunch, but the staff had already driven everyone out in the neighborhood. I will not be returning there.",2014-07-08 19:02:52

The food here is decent.  The atmosphere is nicer than most Thai places. However, for the price, the quality of the food is a bit lacking and inconsistent. For example, I'll use my favorite Malee's dish--the seafood curry. I've ordered it 5 times and 3 x's it was great, 2x's the seafood was very over cooked and dry. At Malee's prices, that's not kosher.

However, one thing I have to give them credit for is service--it's excellent.  The manager is very professional, courteous and does an awesome job taking care of any mistake from the kitchen.

if you want Thai in an atmosphere that's more upscale than traditional Thai restaurants, try Malee's. if you don't care and/or are a cheapskate like me, and/or desire more traditional Thai, try Thai Basil in Tempe.",2008-07-16 07:50:50

The pizza overall was pretty good. I would say that it is pretty similar to other wood fired places that I have been like fired pie or pieology etc. My wife got a sausage pizza, my mom a pepperoni, my kids a cheese and I branched out and got the barbecue chicken pizza. They were all pretty good. The only reason why these guys get 3 stars from me instead of 4 is that they charge you $1 per topping or cheese type of you add it to a ""pre made"" selection.

We were EARLY for our movie.  Chose our end-seats toward the back.  All is well even though everything is overpriced.  (Waaaaay more than H-word.)  

Four adult women came and sat behind us during the previews.  They started talking.  They kept talking.  I gave them the courtesy ""look.""  So did my husband.  Kept talking.  I got up and alerted a manager.  Came back.  An usher came in and supervised for a minute.  He left, they started talking - AGAIN.

We'd been to the his outpost in Kennedy Township some time ago, and when we found out that one recently sprouted in Upper Saint Clair, well, we knew had a trip ahead of us. 

For breakfast that chilly Saturday morning, I honestly enjoyed the Big Burrito, finding it generously appointed, the grilled flour tortilla bulging radiantly with eggs, homefries, onions, green peppers, and my choice of bacon, warm salsa, cheddar, and sour cream coming close to turning it into an enchilada, and damn  was this knife-and-fork material. The scrambled eggs were velvety, the homefries deftly seasoned and al dente, the vegetables lovingly caramelized, adding sweetness to contrast the tang of the sour cream and salsa and sharpness of the cheddar. Hearty as a 3 course meal, I barely had enough room left for the Oreo Pancakes. 

And yes, I will continue to trumpet the cause: Breakfast pancakes are dessert. Lunches and dinners have sweet endings. Why not breakfast? 

These were fairly standard griddlecakes with some Oreo crumbles on them, the commercially made cookies being but an afterthought, and that would be my only complaint.  I would have thought that the batter would have been infused with Oreo crumbs, but that was not the case here. Despite my mild disappointment, the flapjacks were properly fluffy and were topped with powdered sugar. Of course, warm maple syrup and butter were served alongside the golden stack. 

We had no issues with the service or the seating. Even ""Bob"" himself was on hand to greet us and seat us, his personality proving to be as sunny as the decor. 

From what I was tastin', Bob's fledgling empire of checkerboard-tiled luncheonettes is well on its way to competing with Pamela's and DeLuca's for diner supremacy.  Dismiss the savaging. Give Bob a chance.

Three important factors for me in choosing the beef chow mein. 1) the beef. Is is chewy and fatty, or tender and yummy? 2) is there enough veg? and 3) the sauce, flavour and quantity. For The Wokker it passed all three. The beef was good, there were lots of veggies (I hate when it's just onions and a few sparse carrots. There were tons of peppers, broccoli, and water chestnuts too!) and the sauce was soooo yummy.

  *Great Rooms.  Very well appointed.
  *Maybe the best poker room in Vegas.  Their staff is awesome.
  * Excellent Video Poker
  *Never a problem getting a cab, there's always tons!
  *Free shuttles to airport & strip are very smart and welcome!
  *Lots of good restaurants that are reasonably priced
  *The gift shop is fantastic.  Cheap booze, supplies and great staff
  *Probably the best video poker in all of Vegas
  *Free wifi in lobby area
  *Great service at Malibu Bar

The Bad:
  *Front desk made a mistake.  Went I went back to get it corrected I got a bit of            attitude
  *Housekeeping woke me up twice with phone calls when do not disturb was on my door.  Likely caused by front desks error.  Still annoying though!

Baguette Cafe offers indoor and outdoor seating which I love. Their menu looks so good! They have tons of vegetarian and vegan options as well. They also offer amazing fresh soups daily. We both ordered the Blue and Brie sandwich with mushrooms. Baguette gives you the option of mushrooms or chicken on this sandwich. 

Since it was such a nice day we ate outside. They have plenty of seating outside among the trees almost makes you forget your in a business complex. They offer benched seating as well as single seats covered in cushions.

Our food came out quickly. Our sandwiches were accompanied by a small side salad with a house vinaigrette. Super tasty and I loved the tang it had. Now that sandwich!!!! Yummy! The bread which was perfectly toasted and I'm pretty sure was home made. It was the perfect vehicle for all the cheesey goodness. There was a layer of sautéed mushrooms and onions. Next came a little blue cheese and a thick slice of melty Brie! I couldn't help but eat the whole thing. 

Although Baguette Cafe is pretty far from where I live the food is that good I'd drive that far to eat there again. I'd love to try another sandwich or some of their homemade soups. Love it!",2014-11-21 19:58:59

This is an awesome spot just based on the space and attention to detail with the interior design.  The first time I came here we met some folks for some drinks and I was skeptical as we walked farther and farther away from the buzz of the main NoDa area.  Once I was inside, I was glad we had walked over.  They had live music going and a great vibe overall.

The beer here isn't that great in my opinion.  I tried 3 beers and the group I was with all agreed that they tasted tame and watered down.  I tried 3 separate beers because the first 2 weren't good.  I had the IPA, Strawberry Blonde, and I can't remember the last one...big surprise.  They had to have at least 8 different beers on the menu.  I would think if they scaled down to 4~ brews, they could focus on creating a better beer.  The mixed drinks were very good however as they also have a full liquor bar.  I tasted a few of them and would recommend these over the beer.  It's kind of funny to me that their cocktails blow away their beer....and it's supposed to be a brewery!

The food we tried was overpriced and average at best.  The cheese dip for the pretzels was served luke warm even after stirring it up and it lacked flavor.  The spinach & artichoke dip was also served at the same temperature.  Ugh!  Portions were not worth $9 each.

The atmosphere of the store is nice! They have a neon sign that is definitely picture worthy and 5-6 tables if you would like to dine in. Scattered throughout, there are decorations that remind you of the beach or nature. 

As you enter Umami Poke, you are greeted with smiles from the staff and decisions to make regarding your order. The concept of the eatery is a build your own poke bowl where you choose what kind of base you would like first (either salad, Japanese rice, or noodle). Next, you chose from the fresh poke selections to put on top of your base of choice. I had a hard time choosing which poke to select but decided to go for the Shoyu the 6ix (with salmon). I believe their daily poke offerings may change from time to time or they may have a special for the day. Either way, they are clearly listed as you decide. Once the poke is selected, you can choose from a variety of toppings including crab, seaweed salad, cucumbers, red onions, etc. Once that is complete you can add final toppings to your own  poke bowl. A small fish poke bowl will set you back $10, while regular poke bowl will cost you $13. 

For my own poke bowl, I opted for the rice base and added my additional ingredients and toppings. The fish is definitely very fresh and the marinades they use on the fish are very flavourful! Probably has one of the tastiest compared to other poke places I've tried! 

Staff were very friendly and attentive making sure they got your order right. Since I dined in, the staff even came around to ask customers how they thought of their poke bowls.

Overall, great addition to the neighbourhood and fresh and flavourful poke! The only downside is that the cost is a bit pricey.",2018-04-18 22:11:34

She plays her position very well. She needs to work the register all the time, because it makes a first timer's impression-- impressionable. For all I know her shift could've jusssst started so she was coming in fresh, but she didn't miss a beat with greeting the customers entering even with a customer in front of her.

And let me just say...even though their names are on the back of the shirt, I completely forgot the man's name who seems to be the manager or owner...that guy is very courteous and professional as well. The way he interacted with a customer who clearly was a regular seemed pretty upscale.  

It was jamming in there on a Sunday late afternoon. I almost walked out like I did when I had gone to QQ Boba. Upon entering I discovered the line wasn't long, there were just a few people standing waiting for the drinks. It isn't a large shop at all. The pictures made it look like this shop would be spacious, but it isnt, it's spacious enough though!

I haven't had a strawberry black tea in a long while because my usual boba shop changed their strawberry base that I'm not very fond of...so I'm back to being sad. There was so much hope I had for this place in regards to my strawberry black tea. My husband tells me order him whatever. I hate when he says that! It's almost like a trick question or I'm getting tested...I always get nervous while looking at the menu with the echoing of his voice saying, surprise me, order me whateever, etc...

I chose the Caramel Milk Tea with the sea salt cream for him. Our drinks didn't take too long to come out considering there were two orders in front of me including a crepe order. Their crepes look awesome...and I need to be back for it! 

Excited about our drinks, I quickly walk out and tell the husband what I got him. His face look somewhat disappointed. We drive off then I take my first sip. I love when you know the tea was once warm, and it's trying to cool from the ice. Whirl, whirl, whirl, whirl, and eventually it gets cold. You know you're getting a fresh brew or something. I appreciate that. While the strawberry wasn't what I was hoping for, it is certainly my favorite of all strawberry black teas I've had (since my usual boba switched their brand). Next time, I'll adjust it to make it a tad sweeter as I didn't adjust the sweetness level. Catrina says they guarantee their drinks, and if you don't like it...they'll make it the way you like. 

The husband sipped his then put it back into the cup holder then tells me it's warm and it's too sweet. So I say, yeah bitch because it's the Brew Tea Bar. Brew...TEA...milk...TEA...BREW=hot. Come on now bro. Nah, I didn't really say it like that. Close enough, though. Lol. So I say whirl that muthahumper so you get the cream all jived up in there. Now THAT I said. He whirls, whirl, whirl, whirl his cup around...and he says the magic words, 'it's pretty good. Yeah, they're pretty good'. And just like that I made him turn back around from Ann road all the way back to the Brew
 Tea Bar for round two. 

No, just kidding. We wouldn't have done that. More so my husband would have officially think my quest for boba has gone too far. Lol. Certainly a place I'd make my spot when in the area. It's quite a drive for us especially for just boba. Which btw, their honey boba consistency was excellent! 

From our drinks to the service to the inside vibe...this visit warrants 5 stars. I really wish they had one near us! =(

My lunch at Checkers turned out to be a disaster.   We went into the restaurant and there were no customers waiting. I thought to myself, this should be nice and easy.  Both my friend and I ordered the Spicy chicken combo.  While we were waiting for the food, my friend noticed a sign that said 4 items for $3.  We asked the guy at the register about why we were charged higher and he said that we ordered the chicken combo off the menu board. I asked well what the heck did we order that was different from the special and he said that it was the same chicken but because we didn't specifically state that we wanted the special, we couldn't get it.  I then told him that I want to cancel my order and get a refund so I can order the special.  For 18 minutes, no joke, we were going back and forth with this guy trying to get a refund. He eventually and reluctantly gave us a refund.  Meanwhile, our food was sitting on the counter behind the register the entire time we were arguing. The food of course was colder than Antarctica by the time we got it.  I filled out the survey online when I got home that night and asked to be contacted by someone in management. Today, it 's 02/17/17 and I still have not received a call from anyone.  What should have happened is that when we ordered the chicken combo, the employee should have mentioned the special to see if we were interested in it.  And then when I asked for a response from Checkers management, somebody should have reached out to me. I will not be returning here even if you gave me free food for the rest of the  year.",2017-02-17 16:31:20

Located about 1.5 blocks North of Bathurst Station, in a quieter part of The Annex is this relaxed, casual, and warm pizza joint.

Homemade segments of bread with a roasted red pepper/cheese spread and green/black olives were complimentary.  

(I must mention this, but at the bottom of the bread basket was a napkin...that was stained with the red pepper dip, underneath the bread.  After that discovery, I sorta stopped eating the free bread.)

Ordered:  Ortolano (grilled veg) and Cappriosca pizza.  Both pizzas were pretty thin crust.  Sauce was fresh tasting.  Good portion as I was only the eat half of the pizza.  Really good pizza at a decent cost in a cozy spot!",2014-12-29 04:06:11

This restaurant is tucked away on the 2nd floor of the D Hotel casino. Prices are very reasonable for being in a hotel. It's worth the walk and search down Fremont street to get to this place.,2013-03-10 00:26:25

Sent in a form online and they contacted me right back.  I was in the office the next day.  Very courteous staff and all were very helpful.  I did not have my med records but the doctor there checked my neck.  All questions were answered and the fees paid.

The staff over the phone were completely incompetent, impatient and rude!! I can't believe this personality type would work at a tranquil spa setting! Undercover bad attitudes! 

The special was $60 for a 60 minute massage. 

They said they only had 45 minutes available and it would be $95, OR ""they would honor the $60 for 45 minutes."" 

Does this make any sense? This doesn't match the printed special. 

They were very short with me as they were frustrated that I didn't conform to this solution. 45 minutes, and pay the same as the people that get 60 minutes? No. And then to throw other prices at me ""$95.00, $125, 165."" Not sure why these other prices were valid. I was very clear I was calling about the SPECIAL, they should have just said ""I'm sorry, we don't have 60 minutes available in our scheduling, so I won't be able to accommodate the special.""  

The gal even hung up on me out of frustration after I told her ""that's ok, it doesn't really make sense to me, that's not what the special says. Thank you though for your time."" CLICK!!!! Not a thank you or a good bye! Terrible customer service. 

Lets just pretend I was a complete jerk over the phone, don't ever treat someone in customer service this way. Terrible. 

What a bad first impression I received when arriving to HVH. 

You're mama's would be ashamed and I hope management teaches ya a lesson so you don't make this error again and cross the wrong person that'll give it right back atcha! God as my witness, I was very nice, just confused, and they sure did lose their patience with me. :(",2013-09-24 00:27:34

The pulled pork tasted like it was marinated in vinegar overnight. Ordered two sodas; flat. Server left them on the table. Server gave us new sodas; flat. Sever left these on the table. Server charged us for sodas. Restaurant now wants to give 22% gratuity to servers that don't even know the fundamentals of hospitality.

Came here on a Monday evening and the place was empty which worried me, but I trust Yelp reviews so I stayed lol.  The server was obviously new because she didn't know much about the menu but I appreciated she was willing to help and probably ran back to the kitchen 3-4 times to ask questions for me (I can be a pain lol). She got some training out of the way though! Lol

We ordered the meal for two option that included 4-5 entree tastings, rice, naan, yogurt sauce and some desert. I haven't seen this at an Indian place before and I would suggest this option to try the menu!  The butter chicken and the ginger chicken were very good! 

They offer a buffet daily which I am planning on coming back to check out :)",2016-03-02 18:43:03
